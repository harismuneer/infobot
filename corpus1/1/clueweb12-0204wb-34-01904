<h2>Description</h2></a>

<p>I visited the Afghan Embassy in Tokyo today. They confirmed that they first hoisted a new flag
on December 7th 2004 at President Karzai's inauguration ceremony and introduced the flag as the new national flag of the newly born Islamic Republic of Afghanistan since then. The details of the coat-of-arms and flag are regulated in Chapter I, Article no. 19 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan adopted on January 4th 2004 and signed by Karzai as President of the Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan at that time on January 26th 2004.</p>
<p>Differences from the <a href="af2002.html">flag of the Transitional Authority</a>:<ul>
	<li>flag proportion: 1:2 changes to 2:3
	<li>1348 (1929 C.E., year of coronation of Mohammed Nadir Shah) to 1298 
    (i.e. 1919 C.E., year of independence declaration from <a href="gb.html">
    Great Britain</a>)<li>a rising sun composed of 9 long and 8 short rays is added between the <i>shahada</i> and the <i>takbir</i> (<i>Allahu akbar</i>)
</ul>Jaume Oll&eacute; made the flag and arms images based on the new arms image given by the Embassy. Chapter I, Article no. 19 of the Constitution reads as follows:<blockquote>
The Afghan flag is made up of three equal parts, with black, red and green colors juxtaposed from
left to right perpendicularly. The width of every colored piece is equal to half of its length. The <a href="#coa">national emblem</a> is located in the center of the flag. The national emblem of the state of Afghanistan is composed of Mehrab and Pulpit in white color. Two flags are located on its sides.
In the upper-middle part of the insignia the sacred phrase of <i>There is no God but Allah and Mohammad is his prophet</i> and <i>Allah is Great</i> are placed along with a rising sun. The word <i>Afghanistan</i> and the year 1298 (solar calendar) are located in the lower part of the insignia. The emblem is encircled with two branches of wheat. The law shall regulate the use of national flag and emblem.</blockquote></p>
<p><i>Nozomi Kariyasu</i>, 12 January 2005</p>
<p>The Afghan Government has created a <b>draft</b> version of the new 
Constitution for this nation. It will still be called the Islamic Republic of 
Afghanistan. Source: <a href="http://www.constitution-afg.com/draft_const.htm">
http://www.constitution-afg.com/draft_const.htm</a> :<br>
<br>
&quot;Article Nineteen Ch. 1, Art. 19<br>
The Afghan flag is made up of three equal parts, with black, red and green 
colors juxtaposed from left to right perpendicularly. <br>
The width of every colored piece is equal to half of its length. The national 
insignia is located in the center of the flag. The national insignia of the 
state of Afghanistan is composed of Mehrab and pulpit in white color. Two flags 
are located on its two sides. In the upper-middle part of the insignia the 
sacred phrase of “There is no God but Allah and Mohammad is his prophet, and 
Allah is Great” is placed, along with a rising sun. The word “Afghanistan” and 
year 1298 (solar calendar) is located in the lower part of the insignia. The 
insignia is encircled with two branches of wheat. The law shall regulate the use 
of national flag and emblem.&quot;<br>
<br>
To put it in simple terms, the design of the bars is vertically black, red, and 
green. The coat of arms is white, not gold as reported several times. The seal 
is not that much different, but the wording at the bottom of a scroll is gone. 
The nation name and the rising sun is new, and I have no idea if the words &quot;God 
is Great&quot; is going under the Muslim statement of faith, or next to it. A image 
should be provided soon.<br>
<i>Zachary Harden</i>, 3 November 2003</p>
<p>Actually, the name of the state is what is now on the scroll; I read the 
description as meaning that this will be replaced by the word Afghanistan alone. 
And I'm not altogether sure that the rising sun is new; mightn't the rays 
emanating from the scroll and embracing the date below the mihrab be the rising 
sun to which the draft refers? Since the rest of the emblem remains as is, it's 
a good bet that the Takbir (God is Great) will continue to appear beneath the 
creed. The 
<a href="http://www.constitution-afg.com/resrouces/Final%20Draft%20Constitution%20Pashtu%20and%20Dari.pdf">Dari and Pashtu version</a> of the draft  
says it will have &quot;the word 'Afghanistan'&quot;, same spelling in both languages.<br>
<i>Joe McMillan</i>, 4 November 2003</p>
<p>The colours used on the flag are Red: Pantone 186 C 100%; Green: Pantone 3425 
C 100%; Black: Process Black C 100%; White: Process Black C 0%.<br>

<h2><a name="var">Reported variations in the appearance of the flag</a></h2>
<p>With a flag as complex as the Afghan, and its recent history, it is no 
surprise that several variations are found in actual manufactured flags.&nbsp; 
These include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the coat of arms in white or gold, and in some case shades between, even 
  in the same photograph (e.g. this
  <a href="http://news.xinhuanet.com/world/2005-05/24/xinsrc_522050224073998432511.jpg">
  Xinhua Agency photo</a> of Karzai and Bush).</li>
  <li>the flags on the side of mosque as red-white-red, or in some cases all 
  white, or even in black-red-green (see
  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/6175885.stm">this BBC 
  photo</a>)</li>
  <li>the coat of arms may extend out of the red stripe or be constrained within 
  it.</li>
  <li>the detail of the leaves in the wreath vary - shown on this page as leaves the 
  colour of the field behind, and spaces between the leaves white, other 
  representations show solid white leaves with colour of field behind.</li>
  <li>the temple can be shown either in a three-dimensional format or showing 
  only the front face.</li>
  <li>the rising sun can be found either between the Shahada text and the phrase 
  takbir, or exactly above the temple but below both inscriptions.</li>

<h2>Meaning of the Colours</h2></a>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.afghan-web.com">this website</a>, quoting an AFP news of 29 January 2002 via the Times of India:
<blockquote>Border affairs ministry official Abdul Wakil Omari said the three colours of the flag represented a different page in the history of Afghanistan. The black represented the 19th century era when Afghanistan was occupied and did not have independence, red marked the fight for independence and the green showed independence had been achieved, he said.
</blockquote></p>
<p><i>Christian Bergh&auml;nel</i>, 29 January 2002</p>

<p>By sheer coincidence, the three colours happen to be the same as in all Afghan flags between 1928 and 1978... It may be interesting to mention that the origin of these three colours (on the <a href="af1928s.html">1928 flag</a>) is possibly:<ul>
	<li>black appeared representing the <a href="af1928.html">previous (monochrome) field</a> of Afghan flags, which in turn represented the sovereign;
	<li>red was possibly introduced by emir, later king, Aman Allah as a sign of modernity and progress, copied from the <a href="su.html">Soviet flag</a> as happened also with the <a href="af1928s.html">1928-1929 emblem</a>;
	<li>green stood for Islam.

<h2>The <i>Shahada</i></h2></a>

<IMG SRC="../images/a/af_shd.gif" alt="[Shahada (Afghanistan)]" HEIGHT=69 width=200 BORDER=0></A>&nbsp; image by <i>Jaume Oll&eacute;</i></p>

<p>From the <a href="http://irshad.org/exposed/shahada.php">Islamic Resources of the Washington DC Area</a> website: <i>Ashhadu Alla Ilaha Illa Allah 
(Wa) Ashhadu Anna Muhammad Rasulu Allah</i> &#151; "I bear witness that there is no deity other than Allah and that Muhammad is his servant and Messenger".<i><br>
Juan Vaquer Jr.</i>, 24 March 1999</p>

<p>On the <a href="sa.html">Saudi Arabian</a> flag and all other flags that bear the Shahada it is simplified as, <i>La allah illa Allah wa-Muhammed rasulu Allah</i>. Literally: "No deity but God and Muhammad God's messenger".<i><br>
Dov Gutterman</i>, 28 March 1999</p>

<p>I would like to specify that the Shahada written on flags &#151;<a href="af_talib.html">Taliban</a> flag, <a href="sa.html">Saudi Arabian</a> flag etc.&#151; does not have the Arabic conjunction <i>wa</i> ('and') mentioned above. [It is thus simply <i>La allah illa Allah / Muhammed rasulu Allah</i>.]<i><br>
Omar Amastan Mouffok</i>, 26 December 2001</p>

<p>Shahada means 'testimony' or 'approval' in Arabic, and it is the Islamic credo. (...) The shorter form, found on flags, banners and walls of mosques reads, <i>la ilaaha illa llaah (wa) muhammadu rasuulu llaah</i> i.e. <i>There is no god but Allah (and) Mohammad is the messenger of Allah</i>.<i><br>

photo by <i>Joe McMillan</i></p>

This photo was taken in early October 2005 in Kabul at a meeting with 
then-Minister of Interior Ali Jalali. This flag was behind his desk. He 
explained that it is the national flag used in ceremonies and offices by units 
of the Afghan police and military. I believe it would equate to a national 
color. It is a vertical tricolor, black-red-green, with a fringe of gold tassels 
all around. The arms on the center are in gold embroidery and reduced size to 
make room for the inscriptions. Jalali explained that the inscription on the 
green stripe reads, in Arabic, &quot;Victory is from God, and it is near.&quot; The 
inscription on the black stripe is another Koranic quotation, but he didn't say 
what it is. I believe the words above the national emblem are the invocation &quot;Bismillah 
ar-rahman ar-rahim&quot; (In the name of God the compassionate, the merciful) and the 
shahada (There is no God but God and Muhammad is the prophet of God). The 
finial, not visible in the photo, is sort of a bulb that tapers to a point on 
the top. I don't think there was anything below the arms in the portion hidden 
by the chair.<br>
