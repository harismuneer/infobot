						Trials For U.S. Carrier Carl Vinson </p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
						(DEFENSE NEWS 01 JUL 09) ... Christopher P. Cavas
						</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">The 
						nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Carl Vinson 
						returned to Norfolk, Va., on Wednesday after four 
						days of sea trials - the flattop's first taste of 
						the open sea after more than three years in 
						overhaul.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">The 
						Vinson got underway June 28 from Northrop Grumman's 
						Newport News shipyard for the first set of trials 
						to check out the ship's refurbished systems. The 
						trials are to be completed by July 11, according to 
						the U.S. Navy. </p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">The 
						refueling overhaul takes place once in a 
						nuclear-powered carrier's life, which is scheduled 
						to last up to 50 years. The Vinson was built at 
						Newport News and commissioned in March 1982.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">The 
						carrier entered the shipyard in November 2005. The 
						overhaul, which cost more than $3 billion, included 
						refueling the ship's two nuclear reactors, 
						repairing and replacing ship systems and 
						components, and updates to technology and other 
						critical systems, according to the Naval Sea 
						Systems Command. Virtually all of the ship's 2,300 
						compartments were refurbished.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">As 
						a unit of the Pacific fleet, the Vinson was based 
						before the overhaul at Bremerton, Wash. The Navy 
						announced in March 2007 that the ship would likely 
						shift its homeport to San Diego, which hosts the 
						carriers Nimitz and Ronald Reagan. </p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
						Next up for a refueling overhaul is the 
						Norfolk-based carrier Theodore Roosevelt, scheduled 
						to enter Newport News by September. The carrier 
						Abraham Lincoln, based at Everett, Wash., is to 
						begin its refueling overhaul at Newport News in 
						fiscal 2013.</p>

						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
						Several More Cutting-Edge Helicopters Will 
						Eventually Be Brought To The Naval Air Station.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
						(FLORIDA TIMES-UNION 01 JUL 09) ... Timothy J. 
						Gibbons </p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">The 
						Navy's newest helicopter officially moved into its 
						newest hangar Tuesday, giving a home to the first 
						squadron on the East Coast to use the aircraft.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">The 
						fancy new hangar at Jacksonville Naval Air Station 
						will house a fancy new helicopter, one on the 
						cutting edge of fighting against submarines and 
						surface threats.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
						&quot;These are special moments,&quot; Rear Adm. Tim 
						Alexander, who began his career flying helicopters, 
						said at the ribbon-cutting for the building. &quot;Not 
						everyone gets the opportunity to fly a new platform 
						and operate out of a new hangar.&quot;</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">The 
						Sikorsky MH-60R, known as the Romeo, can launch 
						from a variety of ships and is packed with an array 
						of technological upgrades, from better radar and 
						sonar to more room for missiles and digital 
						displays rather than gauges.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
						&quot;This could detect a soda can floating in the 
						ocean,&quot; said Lt. Cmdr. Mark Yehl, who is overseeing 
						the transition to the Romeos from its older 
						counterparts.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
						Moving to the new aircraft is just a matter of 
						training, said Lt. Sean O'Lone, who spent six 
						months in San Diego learning to do just that before 
						coming to Jacksonville.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">&quot;It 
						will be real nice to be here,&quot; he said about the 
						new hangar. &quot;We just didn't have enough room 
						before.&quot;</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
						Four aircraft are at the base now, with seven more 
						coming in the next six months. As a result of the 
						shift to the new aircraft, Mayport Naval Station 
						will lose two squadrons, but the three squadrons 
						left will get bigger.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
						Eventually, 57 helicopters and more than 1,400 
						personnel will call the place home.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">The 
						crews will be moving in from World War II-era 
						buildings, ones that don't have enough room for the 
						modern aircraft or the number of people required to 
						work with them.</p>
						<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">The 
						new hangar is the second &quot;green&quot; building in the 
						Navy, with touches like natural light illumination 
						in much of the building and a rain collection 
						system that will provide water for toilets and 
						helicopter washing. (The Navy's other 
						environmentally friendly building is the recently 
						opened P-3 hangar, also at Jacksonville NAS.)</p>

						<p class="NoSpacing">FREMANTLE, Australia (NNS) -- 
						USS George Washington (CVN 73), the Navy's only 
						permanently forward-deployed aircraft carrier, 
						anchored off the coast of Fremantle, Australia, as 
						the USS Cowpens (CG 63) steamed into port July 2 to 
						begin a scheduled five-day port visit.<br>
						<br>
						This is GW's first Australian port visit in its 
						nearly 17-year history and the first port visit of 
						GW's inaugural summer deployment since replacing 
						the USS Kitty Hawk last September. The ship, along 
						with embarked Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 5 and their 
						combined crew of nearly 5,000 Sailors departed 
						their forward-deployed port at Yokosuka, Japan, 
						June 10.<br>
						<br>
						The Aegis guided-missile cruiser, Cowpens, also 
						known as the &quot;Thundering Herd,&quot; was commissioned in 
						1991. Her primary mission is to provide air-defense 
						to the George Washington Carrier Strike Group. <br>
						<br>
						&quot;As the Navy's only permanently forward-deployed 
						aircraft carrier, we look forward to this visit and 
						to our first opportunity to work with our 
						Australian allies,&quot; said GW Commanding Officer 
						Capt. David A. Lausman. <br>
						<br>
						&quot;This part of our summer deployment operationalizes 
						the chief of naval operations' global maritime 
						strategy and partnerships as we move throughout the 
						expansive Seventh Fleet Area of Responsibility. The 
						initial acquaintances and professional 
						relationships we make benefit all concerned. 
						Together, we improve stability, understanding and 
						cooperation with our partner nations.&quot;<br>
						<br>
						Lausman pointed out that more than 300 GW/CVW-5 
						Sailors plan to use their liberty time by 
						volunteering at one of 14 community relations (COMREL) 
						projects.<br>
						<br>
						&quot;These projects remain the most sought-after and 
						popular events among the 5,000-plus combined crew 
						of GW/CVW-5,&quot; he said.<br>
						<br>
						Projects include cleaning, maintenance and painting 
						work at a variety of locations throughout Fremantle 
						and nearby Perth, including the Princess Margaret 
						Hospital, Perth Hebrew Congregation, a Salvation 
						Army rehabilitation center, Perth Zoo, Cohunu Koala 
						Park and other animal refuges.<br>
						<br>
						&quot;I think these Sailors will greatly benefit from 
						taking part, and it says a lot about them as 
						Sailors taking time to volunteer, out of a spirit 
						of cooperation and goodwill,&quot; said Lt. Cmdr. David 
						Yang, GW chaplain and COMREL coordinator. <br>
						<br>
						The ship's Morale, Welfare and Recreation division 
						has scheduled 18 different trips and tours to help 
						Sailors make the most of their visit while enjoying 
						the distinct sights, sounds and tastes of western 
						Australia.<br>
						<br>
						Tour options include: a trip to Caversham Wildlife 
						Park and Nambung National Park, a tour of wineries 
						throughout the Swan Valley, mountain biking on the 
						Munda Biddi Trail and scuba-diving at Rottnest 
						Island.<br>
						<br>
						&quot;For a majority of the GW crew, who brought the 
						ship to Yokosuka from Norfolk last fall, this is 
						their first visit to Australia,&quot; Lausman said. &quot;I 
						know our Sailors are looking forward to 
						experiencing the rich culture and interacting with 
						the friendly citizens of Australia during our brief 
						stay.&quot;</p>

							training], and we've made more than 500 changes 
							to the maintenance and flight publications,&quot; 
							said Dodge. &quot;We've had three major upgrades 
							since we've gotten the aircraft and have set 
							the foundation for the entire community to 
							build upon.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							Maintenance Master Chief (AFCM) (AW) Walter 
							Butac, who has been with the squadron since its 
							commissioning, said the major challenge was 
							working with brand new aircraft, which were the 
							first ones of their type to be manufactured in 
							the world.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;We have been learning how to maintain it from 
							day one,&quot; said Butac.<br>
							<br>
							Butac said the squadron's electronics 
							technicians had to be retrained to maintain the 
							new helicopter.<br>
							When the Navy first established the squadron, 
							personnel being assigned to the &quot;Raptors&quot; came 
							from various backgrounds and job experiences.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;We had people coming from fixed-wing aircraft 
							and different helicopter squadrons, and they 
							all had different ways of doing business,&quot; said 
							Butac. &quot;That was the real challenge – to make 
							them work together. But we learned a lot during 
							the workups, and it worked out pretty good.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							According to Dodge, the high point of HSM-71's 
							maiden deployment was the USWEX [undersea 
							warfare exercise].<br>
							<br>
							&quot;Since one of our primary missions is ASW 
							[anti-submarine warfare], the USWEX that we did 
							in February really showed the tactical 
							capabilities of what we can do with the 
							aircraft,&quot; said Dodge. &quot;It was nice to see 
							because it validated everything else that we've 
							done.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							During the USWEX, HSM-71 deployed multiple 
							aircraft to simulate engagements with U.S. and 
							Japanese submarines.<br>
							<br>
							The squadron kept three helos airborne 
							throughout the entire four-day exercise for a 
							total 222 flight hours and conducted 28 
							simulated attacks on two U.S. and two Japanese 
							submarines.<br>
							<br>
							Dodge said he was proud of what his squadron 
							accomplished during the USWEX, but he really 
							saw them come together as a team when a helo 
							had to be downed due to mechanical failure.<br>
							<br>
							&quot;One of the aircraft had a problem with its 
							sensors,&quot; said Dodge. &quot;It was replaced by 
							another aircraft that launched within 15 
							minutes. So the crew and the maintainers had 
							that aircraft prepped and ready to go. The 
							failed system was fixed within two hours and 
							was ready to go back into the rotation. From 
							the warfare commander's perspective, there was 
							no gap. It was pretty impressive.&quot;<br>
							<br>
							As the &quot;Raptors&quot; approach the end of their 
							first deployment, Dodge said the squadron has 
							been blessed to be incident free while still 
							meeting all their mission requirements.<br>
							<br>
							During their workups and maiden deployment, 
							HSM-71 flew more than 4,690 hours with a 95 
							percent sortie completion rate and earned the 
							right to fly the Enlisted Aviation Warfare 
							Pennant.</span></div>

					Carl Vinson Set To Be Redelivered</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					(NEWPORT NEWS DAILY-PRESS 06 JUL 09) ... Peter Frost</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">While 
					Northrop Grumman's Newport News shipyard will not 
					redeliver the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson to the 
					Navy on time, the ship is on track to come in under its 
					original budget of about $3.2 billion.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">With 
					the flat top's 43-month complex overhaul and nuclear 
					refueling nearly complete, Northrop and the Navy say 
					the massive maintenance project will cost about $3.1 
					billion, a significant victory for the Newport News 
					shipyard and the service.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">The 
					Vinson is due to be redelivered to the Navy this 
					weekend once it passes a final round of sea trials.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					Northrop and the Navy attributed the overhaul's 
					under-budget success to their unique partnership, in 
					which sailors and shipyard workers labored side-by-side 
					to extend the ship's life to 50 years.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">Part of 
					the savings came from the help of the ship's company, 
					who combined to save the project about $40 million, 
					said Lt. Cmdr. Jim Krohne, a spokesman for the Vinson.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">The 
					ship's company replaced 1,284 racks of berthing, 
					replaced 2,275 lockers, painted more than 1,400 spaces 
					and assigned a fire-watch team to hazardous projects 
					replacing yard workers, an initiative that cut nearly 
					$12 million in costs.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">An 
					engineering crew composed completely of sailors 
					completed more than 10,000 tasks representing about 
					302,000 man hours, saving an estimated $14 million, 
					Krohne said.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					&quot;Everybody feels good,&quot; he said. &quot;We feel like we've 
					contributed a lot to the quality of this ship, and it's 
					something everybody is proud of.&quot;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">Last 
					week, the carrier performed well during four days at 
					sea, but material in the water restricted the intake of 
					one of the ship's systems, said Jennifer Dellapenta, a 
					shipyard spokeswoman. That system — along with a few 
					others — will be retested on Friday, when the Vinson 
					will begin a scheduled underway period in which the 
					ship will recertify its flight deck.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">The 
					Navy had targeted March 2009 as an original delivery 
					date, but a combination of factors led to a three-month 
					delay.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					Problems with some critical ship components and some 
					new work items identified during the project required 
					more time to complete, Northrop said.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">The 
					company also was forced to divert some workers from the 
					Vinson to the George H.W. Bush carrier, which also fell 
					behind schedule, Krohne said.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">&quot;We 
					didn't make marks,&quot; he said. &quot;But we're now getting 
					under way — and we're coming out of the yard the most 
					operationally ready carrier to do so&quot; after a midlife 
					overhaul.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">The 
					Refueling and Complex Overhaul, or RCOH, is a massive 
					undertaking in which carriers are essentially gutted 
					and refitted with new equipment, defueled and refueled.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">Crews 
					upgraded the flight deck, catapults and arresting gear, 
					updated combat and communications systems and 
					refurbished the ship's propellors, hull, rudders, pumps 
					and internal piping.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">About 
					35 percent of all maintenance and modernization done to 
					the 27-year-old Vinson takes place during its midlife 
					overhaul.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">Once 
					the Vinson completes its flight-deck certifications and 
					carrier qualifications, it is scheduled to return to 
					the Newport News shipyard in August for a postdelivery 
					maintenance period.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">This 
					fall, the Vinson will join the Enterprise, the Theodore 
					Roosevelt, the George H.W. Bush and the 
					under-construction Gerald R. Ford in the Newport News 
					yard, marking only the second time that many carriers 
					have been on the James River waterfront.</p>

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">The

					included $29.6 million for improvements at the pier 
					where a carrier would tie up.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">Having 
					the committee appropriate the money is another step 
					toward getting the work under way. The full House of 
					Representatives still has to approve the bill that has 
					the funding for the measure. It is expected to vote on 
					it next week.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">After

					out their differences: The House version does not 
					include permission for the project.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">Even if 
					the pier work and dredging - which could begin in 2010 
					or 2011 and take about two years - gets passed, Mayport

					yesterday.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					&quot;Whether we continue down the Growler path is a 
					decision for the government well into the future,&quot; he 
					added.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">Binskin 
					declined to specify a time frame for the move but said 
					changes in the Australian security environment would 
					inform the decision.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">&quot;It 
					would be a good move to support [the F-35 Joint Strike 
					Fighter] and the classic Hornets&quot; already in the 
					Australian fleet, he said.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					Australia spent an additional U.S. $31 million to wire 
					the 12 aircraft for the electronic attack capability, 
					according to one Australian official.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">Binskin 
					added that his country has no &quot;plan B&quot; to purchase more 
					Super Hornets if the F-35 is not able to enter the 
					inventory as currently scheduled.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					Australia is spending approximately U.S. $4.6 billion 
					over 10 years on the 24 Super Hornets, according to a 
					statement released yesterday by the country's defense 
					ministry.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">&quot;The 
					RAAF Super Hornet will bring a new generation of air 
					power to Australia,&quot; said Group Capt. Steve Robertson 
					of the RAAF. &quot;Its advanced, networked weapons system 
					will deliver enhanced air combat capability across the 
					spectrum of air-to-air, strategic land attack and 
					maritime strike. It is a true multi-role aircraft.&quot;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">Binskin 
					also expressed optimism about the planned integration 
					of the Lockheed Martin [LMT] Joint Air-to-Surface 
					Standoff Missile (JASSM) on the country's older 
					Hornets.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">&quot;We're 
					fully aware of the issues that are happening with the 
					program,&quot; he said. &quot;But we still see it as the weapon 
					we want to put on the classic Hornets.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">U.S. 
					Air Force officials have said the stealth cruise 
					missile program is in danger of termination if it does 
					not pass reliability tests scheduled for later this 
					summer.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">&quot;I'm 
					confident with where it's going at the moment,&quot; Binskin 
					added, &quot;but we'll just have to wait and see.&quot;</p>
