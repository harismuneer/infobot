I'm just curious, I keep hearing this loses by popular vote thing, but from what I read the recount showed he won, so what does that mean then?<br />
also, if its about close voting and some say they meant to vote gore but accidentally voted bush, who is the one at fault. and thirdly, a number of reports said the democrats tried to have all overseas votes disallowed, apparently due to the fact that many of the overseas votes were military and they felt military = republican, does anyone have info on that please, were they disallowed and how could they get away with that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They just forgot to read those reports. Believing that the election was stolen allows them to get away with dirty tricks to make up for it. <br />
<br />
Examples: Voter registration fraud, votes from dead people, intimidating voters, vandaling/robbing GOP headquarters, committing assault on voters, damaging personal property, etc etc etc. And finally trying to sue their way into the White House with 10,000 lawyers.</div></div><hr />
