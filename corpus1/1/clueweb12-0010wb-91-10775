  <li>THE CAPITAL GAINS CONTROVERSY</li>
</ul>
Capital gains taxation has been a divisive issue in Congress at least
since the debates surrounding the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which, aiming
to eliminate tax loopholes and shelters and preferences, repealed
preferentially low tax rates for long-term gains.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1</span></small> To
bring effective capital gains tax rates back down again was President
Bush&#8217;s &#8220;top priority in tax policy.&#8220;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small> In
1989, Senate Democrats blocked a determined drive to reduce effective
tax rates on the part of Bush, Republican Senators Packwood, Dole and
others, and a few Democratic allies.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">3</span></small> The
administration argued that the tax cuts would stimulate economic growth
and induce asset sales, thereby actually increasing federal tax
revenues; Congressional Democrats countered that the plan benefited
mainly the wealthy, and that tax revenues would in fact decline.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">4</span></small> The
Joint Committee on Taxation projected that budget shortfalls beginning
in 1991 would sum to about $24 billion by 1994 &#8212;&nbsp; and that most
of the
direct benefits would go to individuals with over $200,000 in taxable
income. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said that a third of the savings
would be enjoyed by those with gross incomes over one million dollars.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">5</span></small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">1 Capital gains received
preferential income tax treatment from 1921 through 1987. The Revenue
Act of 1942 provided for a fifty percent exclusion for noncorporate
capital gains or losses on assets held over six months; the Revenue Act
of 1978 raised the exclusion to sixty percent. These exclusions reduced
the effective rate from approximately 49 to 28 percent. The Economic
Recovery Act of 1981 reduced the effective rate still further, to 20
percent, as a result of the reduction in the top marginal tax rate from
70 to 50 percent. However, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated
exclusions for capital gains after 1988. Corporate capital gains were
taxed at an alternative rate of 25 percent with the Internal Revenue
Code of 1954, then at 30 percent with the Tax Reform Act of 1969. The
alternative rate was reduced to 28 percent by the Revenue Act of 1978,
and repealed by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which provided for taxation
of (taxable) realized capital gains as ordinary income. Joint Committee
on Taxation (1990), p. 11.</font></small><font size="-1"><br>

<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small><br>
An October, 1990 congressional budget agreement cut the maximum capital
gains tax rate from 33 to 28 percent. The cut was less than the
administration had sought, and Bush continued to press for further rate
reductions; but significantly, it reestablished preferential taxation,
as the maximum rate on ordinary income was now 31 percent.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">6<br>
</span></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">6Pollack (1991), p. 56.</font></small></div>
<br>
Bush&#8217;s January 1991 budget proposal included provisions to reduce the
tax rate on certain capital gains. Individuals would be allowed to
exclude a percentage of the gain from qualified assets, the percentage
increasing with the length of the holding period. The effective tax
rate for an asset held three years or more, for example, would have
been 19.6 percent for an individual in the 28-percent tax bracket.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">7</span></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> <small><font size="-1">7 &#8220;In addition, all depreciation
    would be recaptured in full as
    ordinary income.&#8221; Joint Committee on Taxation (1990), p. 15. &#8220;The
    proposal was introduced by Senators Packwood, Dole and Roth as S. 2071
    . . . March 15, 1990.&#8221;</font></small></div>
<p>A year later, Congressional Democrats put forth their own plan to index
  capital gains for inflation, which, they argued, was a more equitable
  way to reduce effective tax rates. Opponents countered that the wealthy
  would benefit even more from indexing than from Bush&#8217;s plan &#8212; or that
&#8220;indexing would not provide the quick stimulus that Bush claims would
  come from his proposal&#8221; to slash capital gains tax rates.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic;"> </span></small>While the proposal to
  index gains has continued support today, it is adamantly opposed by the
Treasury on grounds of administrative unfeasibility.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">9</span></small></p>

</div>
Last year, the tax cut plan of Presidential candidate Bob Dole would
have halved capital gains tax rates, from 28 to 14 percent.<br>
<br>
Concern that a capital gains tax cut would eventually, after an initial
sell-off, necessitate higher ordinary income tax rates to meet budget
shortfalls &#8220;has kept the nation&#8217;s business community from monolithic
endorsement of the proposals.&#8220;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">10</span></small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">l0 Elving (1989), p. 2300.</font></small><br>
</div>
<small></small>However, proposals to cut capital gains taxes have increasingly
enjoyed bipartisan support in recent months, fueled partly by the
run-up of stock prices which has created huge paper gains. President
Clinton&#8217;s budget proposals of January 1997 called for a tax exemption
for up to $500,000 in capital gains from the sale of personal
residences, and it is reported that he has signaled his willingness to
contemplate a broad-based cut in future&nbsp;negotiations,
perhaps to a 20 percent maximum rate.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">11</span></small> A
bill introduced in January by Senate Republicans would reduce the
effective rate from 28 percent to 19.8 percent for individuals and from
35 percent to 28 percent for corporations, and would also index gains
for inflation. In February, Senate Democratic Majority Whip Wendell
Ford announced his support for a broad-based capital gains tax cut.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">12</span></small> As
The Wall Street Journal reports, &#8220;Prospects for a big cut in the

FROM THE CAPITAL GAINS DEBATE?<br>
<br>
</span>The most frequently heard arguments for reducing capital gains
taxes are: <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">(1) to reduce the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">&#8220;lock-in&#8221; effect</span>, by which high tax
rates at
realization deter asset sales;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">14</span></small> <br>
(2) to relieve a disproportionate burden on homeowners; <br>
(3) to compensate for the erosion of capital gains by inflation, as an
alternative to indexing;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">15</span></small> <br>
(4) to end alleged double taxation of both capital stocks and income
flows; <br>
(5) to spur productive enterprise and investment; and <br>
(6) to generate more tax revenue from the consequent growth in asset
sales and productivity.</div>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><font size="-1">14 Some argue that eliminating
step-up of basis at death would do more to reduce lock-in than a rate
cut. See Joint Committee on Taxation (1990), p. 2 1; Gaffney (1991).</font></small><font size="-1"><br>

This report calls attention to a neglected aspect of the capital gains
issue &#8212;&nbsp; one which bears importantly on the fifth- and
sixth-named
consequences.<br>
<br>
Much of the capital gains debate today focuses on the stock market.
Business recipients of capital gains are characterized as small
innovative firms making <span style="font-weight: bold;">initial
public offerings (IPOs)</span>. In recent
years such firms have been responsible for a disproportionate share of
new hiring. It is hoped that corporations will be able to raise money
to employ more labor and invest in more plant and equipment if buyers
of their stocks can sell these securities with less of a tax bite.
Stock market gains thus are held to stimulate new direct investment,
employment, and output.<br>
<br>
Typical of the campaign to reduce capital gains taxes is a Wall Street
Journal editorial, &#8220;Capital Gains: Lift the Burden.&#8221; Author W. Kurt
Hauser argues that when the capital gains tax rate was increased from
20 percent to 28 percent in 1989, the effect was to deter asset sales,
causing a decline in the capital gains to be reaped and taxed. He
refers, however, only to stock market gains, and specifically, to
equity in small businesses. Citing the example of yacht producers, he
suggests that taxing capital gains on stocks issued by these businesses
&#8220;locks in&#8221; capital asset sales, thereby deterring new investment and
hiring, and reducing the supply of yachts.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">16</span></small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">16 Hauser (1995).</font></small></div>
<br>
Others contend that new productive investment is relatively insensitive
to capital gains tax rates, arguing, for example, that most of the
money placed in venture-capital funds come from tax-exempt pension
funds, endowments, and foundations.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">17 <br>

</font></div>
<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span></small>What is missing from the discussion is a sense of
proportion as to how capital gains are made. Data that is available
from the Department of Commerce, the IRS, and the Federal Reserve Board
indicate that <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">roughly
two thirds of the economy's capital </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">gains are taken, not in
the stock market &#8212; much less in new offerings &#8212; but in real </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">estate.<small>18<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><br>
</span>The Federal Reserve Board estimates land values at some $4.4
trillion for 1994. Residential structures add $5.9 trillion, and other
buildings another $3.1 trillion. This $13.4 trillion of real estate
value represents two thirds of the total $20 trillion in overall assets
for the United States economy.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">19</span></small> Real
estate accounts for three-fourths of the economy's capital consumption
allowances. It also is the major collateral for debt, and generates
some two-thirds of the interest paid by American businesses. Real
estate taxes are the economy's major wealth tax, although their yield
has declined as a proportion of all state and local revenues, from 70
percent in 1930 to about one-fourth today.<small><br>

Capital gains statistics are much harder to come by. One cannot simply
measure the increased value of the capital stock, for part of the rise
represents investment&#8212;production of new capital &#8212; rather than
appreciation of existing capital and land. The IRS conducts periodic
sampling of capital gains based on tax returns, and its Statistics on
Income presents various analyses of the shares of total capital gains
reported by the economy's income cohorts, from the richest five percent
down. The samples are admittedly asymmetrical, however, and some of the
categories overlap. Significantly, for instance, stock market gains
include a large component of land and other real estate gains. <br>
<br>
This policy brief seeks to elucidate the role of real estate in the
capital gains issue, indicating the quantitative orders of magnitude
involved.. We offer two main observations. 
<ul>
  <li>First, <span style="font-weight: bold;">generous </span><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">capital
consumption allowances (CCAs) </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">greatly
magnify the proportion of real estate income taken as taxable capital
gains.</span> Capital gains accrue not only on newly constructed
buildings, of course, but also on land and old buildings being sold and
resold. Our tax code allows for properties to be re-depreciated by
their new owners after a sale or swap, permitting real estate investors
to recapture principal again and again on the same structure. When CCAs
have been excessive relative to true economic depreciation, as they
were during the 1980s, capital gains have been commensurately larger
than the actual increase in property prices. As Charts la and lb
illustrate, capital consumption allowances in real estate dwarf those
in other industries.</li>

<ul>
  <li>Second, <span style="font-weight: bold;">very little of real
estate cash flow is taxable as ordinary income, so the capital gains
tax is currently the only major federal levy paid by the real estate
industry.</span> CCAs and tax-deductible mortgage interest payments
combine to exempt most of real estate cash flow from the income tax.
This encourages debt pyramiding as it throws the burden of public
finance onto other taxpayers.  </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">A central conclusion of our study is
that better statistics on asset
values and capital gains are needed &#8212; or, more to the point, a better
accounting format. The economic effects of a capital gains tax depend
upon how the gains are made. </span>The present GNP/NIPA format fails
to
differentiate between wealth and overhead; between value from
production and value from obligation. In particular, theory and
measurement should distinguish real estate from other sources of
capital gains &#8212; aid, within the category of real estate, distinguish
land from built improvements. Markets for immovable structures and for
land have distinctive inherent features<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">20</span></small> and
are shaped by distinctive institutional constraints.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">20 Gaffney (1994a).</font></small></div>
<small><br>
</small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Our second major conclusion is
that, at least until
re-depreciation of second-hand buildings is disallowed, a capital gains
tax cut would be unlikely to stimulate much new investment and
employment from its largest beneficiary, the real estate industry.
</span>Depreciation allowances and mortgage interest absorb so much of
the
ongoing cash flow as to leave little taxable income. Mortgage interest
payments, which now consume the lion&#8217;s share of cash flow, are
tax-deductible, while CCAs offset much of what remains of rental
income. On an industry-wide basis, in fact, NIPA statistics reveal that
depreciation offsets <span style="font-style: italic;">more </span>than
the total reported income. As Charts 2a, 2b, and 2c illustrate, real
estate corporations and partnerships have recently reported net losses
year after year.<br>

The result is that real estate corporations pay minimal income
taxes &#8212; some $1.3 billion in 1988, just one percent of the $137
billion
paid by corporate America as a whole.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">21</span></small>
Comparable figures are not available on non-corporate income tax
liability, but the FIRE sector (finance, insurance, and real estate)
reported negative income of $3.4 billion in 1988, out of a total $267
billion of non-farm proprietors&#8217; income.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">22</span></small> These
three symbiotically linked sectors thus were left with only capital
gains
taxes to pay on their cash flow.<br>

<br>
The central point for capital gains tax policy is that taxable capital
gains in real estate consist of more than just the increase in land and
building prices. They represent the widening margin of sales price over
the property&#8217;s depreciated value. The tax accountant&#8217;s book-value gains
result from charging off capital
consumption allowances as a tax credit against cash flow. The more
generous are the capital consumption write-offs for real estate, the
more rapidly a property&#8217;s book value is written down. The fiction of
fast write-off is eventually &#8220;caught&#8221; as a capital gain when the real
estate is either sold or refinanced.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Excessive
depreciation allowances thus convert ordinary income into capital </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">gains. Moreover,
capital gains are the only point at which most real estate income is </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">taxed </span>To
abolish the capital gains tax would annul the entire accumulated income
tax liability which real estate owners have converted into a capital
gains obligation. The income written off over the years as
over-depreciation would not be caught at all. The economy's largest
industry would have its income rendered tax-free. <br>
<br>
Capital gains already are being taxed much more lightly than ordinary
income, especially when deferrals and exemptions are taken into
account. Even if exemptions were eliminated and the capital gains tax
rate were set as high as the ordinary income tax rate, the effective
burden (what economists call the <span style="font-style: italic;">present
value</span> of the tax) would be substantially lower to the extent
that the capital gains tax is paid only retroactively, upon realization
(sale) rather than as the gains actually accrue.<br>
<br>
One therefore must doubt the claim that cutting the capital gains tax
would increase government revenue by encouraging investors to sell
their assets. Kurt Hauser&#8217;s editorial asserts that &#8220;trillions of
dollars are locked up in mature, relatively non-productive low-cost
assets,&#8221; but does not explain that most of these &#8220;mature&#8221; assets take
the form of depreciated real estate. Although real estate prices have
stagnated, the book value of buildings has been diminished by much
more. Now that these buildings are fully depreciated, owners have an
incentive to sell or swap them once again so as to continue sheltering
their income. The effect has been to leave substantial capital gains to
be declared in the near future, while the properties can be sold for
much more than their depreciated value.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">23</span></small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">23 In these statistics we find
the explanation for the fact that
reported capital gains have fallen off since 1989. The reason is not,
as Hauser (1995) claims, because the capital gains tax hike has induced
fewer sales of stocks or direct business assets that have increased in
value, but because the collapsing real estate bubble has left in its
wake fewer land-value gains to be taken. Even assuming that investors
were sensitive to the increased capital gains tax rate, there have been
fewer gains to reap since prices peaked in 1989.</font></small><br>
</div>
While it is often true that the prospect of earning capital gains is
what induces new investment to be made, applying further rate cuts to
real estate gains cannot be expected to spur much new construction
activity under present fiscal institutions. Clearly a &#8220;capital&#8221; gains
tax cut cannot cause the production of more land; land (as distinct
from capital improvements) is made by nature, not by the landowner. As
to buildings, more of the tax benefit would go to speculators in
existing capital than to investors in construction and renewal. We also
doubt that a further rate reduction is likely to accelerate real estate
turnover by reversing a &#8220;lock-in effect.&#8221; Turnover is strongly affected
by depreciation rates. In periods of rapid write-offs &#8212; most
strikingly
during the 1980s, when real estate could be written off faster than in
any other period &#8212;&nbsp; buildings tend to be sold as soon as they are
depreciated. The 1986 reforms reduced the incentives for this rapid
turnover, but the principle is clear: When depreciation rates are high,
there is a powerful tax-induced incentive to sell a building when it is
fully depreciated.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">24</span></small> The
basic motivation at work, of course, is to avoid taking investment
returns as taxable income. Investors prefer to declare as much of their
income as possible in the form of capital gains, which are taxed later
and at a lower rate.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">24 For an analysis of lock-in
and capital gains taxation, see Gaffhey (1990).</font></small><font size="-1"><br>
</font></div>
<small></small>Sound tax policy requires an understanding of the fiscal
assumptions which underlie our tax code and the mythical world of
national income accounting. Far from being a potent stimulus to new
investment, a general capital gains tax cut would preferentially
benefit owners of already depreciated buildings speculators in already
seasoned stocks, leading to further deterioration of economic health.
It cannot be expected to raise the volume of capital gains declared by
enough to increase the total tax revenue generated.<small><br>
<br>
<big style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="2._Depreciation_and_Capital_Gains"></a>2. Depreciation and
Capital Gains<br>
<br>
</big></small>Much of the statistical measurement problem derives from
the fact that capital gains in real estate differ from those in other
industries. While all investors presumably would prefer to take their
income in non-taxable forms and to defer whatever tax obligation is
due, the tax benefits to the real estate industry have no analog in
manufacturing, agriculture, power generation, transportation, wholesale
and retail trade, or other services. Corporations in these sectors pay
taxes on their net incomes. Out of their after-tax earnings they then
pay dividends, on which stockholders in turn must pay income tax. By
contrast, little or none of the rental cash flow received by real
estate investors is taxable, because generous capital consumption
allowances are treated as costs and deducted from the net income
reported to the IRS.<br>
<br>
The effect of calculating capital gains for real estate on the basis of
depreciated book values may be illustrated by the following example. A
building bought in 1985 has probably been fully written off today,
thanks to the generous CCAs enacted by the 1981 tax code that remained
in place through 1986. For a parcel bought in 1985 for $100 million and
sold today for $110 million, the recorded gain is not merely the 10
percent increase in market price, but <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">the entire value of the
building</span>, perhaps $65 million based on the real estate
industry&#8217;s average land-to-building assessment ratios.<br>
<br>
Industrial investors must pay tax on their accruals of unsold
inventories as they mount up, <span style="font-style: italic;">as if</span>
they were sold for cash. Publishing companies, for instance, owe taxes
on books that remain unsold at the end of the year, which leads to fast
liquidation of such inventories and often to the pulping of unsold
books. A shift in publishing policy has taken place toward faster
sellers and smaller print runs.<br>
<br>
Factory owners usually must junk their machinery when it wears out. At
the very least, it is sold off at a nominal price and replaced with
higher-productivity equipment, enabling producers to remain competitive
in the face of technological progress. Industrial depreciation
allowances are thus well justified, and rarely need to be offset by
subsequent capital gains declarations. Real estate, however, is
depreciated more than once, as a matter of course. Unlike other
industrial assets, buildings that have been depreciated just once long
run. Nevertheless, it is principally the location that becomes more
valuable. Rising land values tend to more than offset any decline in
building values. In practice, a significant portion of land
appreciation tends often to be imputed to buildings, further expanding
CCAs by allowing even land to be partly depreciated.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">25<br>
</span></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">25 Gaffney (1993).</font><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">
</small></div>
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Thus the putative
beneficiaries of cutting capital gains taxes &#8212; direct investors&nbsp;
&#8212; suffer
</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">less from
high capital
gains tax rates than from the treatment of much of their </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">capital gain as
ordinary income, which is taxed at higher rates. In real estate, on the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">other hand,
depreciation effectively converts much of ordinary income to capital
gains. </span>Whereas industrial investors pay tax on rising
investment in unsold inventories, even when no sales revenue is
received, real estate investors pay tax neither on rental income nor on
increases in property values as they accrue. The industry actually
receives cash income, but for tax purposes reports a cash loss. Because
real estate and manufacturing face such different cash flow tax
treatment, it is misleading to take the manufacturing industry as a
proxy for real estate in discussing the effect of cutting capital gains
tax rates.<br>
<br>
The greatest accounting distortion for the real estate industry occurs
in the case of re-depreciation of buildings that already have been
depreciated at least once. This redepreciation occurs following
ownership transfers; the CCA is attached not to the physical asset, but
to the change of ownership. As the building is resold at rising prices,
investors are allowed to re-depreciate them again and again &#8212; and to
write off these CCAs against their income, as if they were suffering an
erosion of wealth. Thus, most capital gains in real estate represent
&#8220;repeat gains&#8221; over unrealistically written-down book values. This
accounting fiction enables real estate investors to continue
indefinitely to take their income in the lightly taxed form of capital
gains.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">26</span></small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">26 Another kind of subsidy
occurs in the sphere of farm real estate. Speculation in farmland is
reflected in the high ratio of farm prices to gross receipts. This
suggests that, on the one hand, &#8220;gentleman fanning&#8221; occurs in
near-suburban areas as a means of minimizing property taxes (thanks to
the lower appraisals of land zoned for agricultural use), and on the
other hand, speculation in anticipation that the land&nbsp; subsequently will
be rezoned for commercial and residential
development. </font></small><br>
</div>
Landlords already deduct from earnings as normal business expenses
their maintenance and repair expenditures, undertaken to counteract the
wear and tear of buildings.<span style="font-weight: bold;"> A rule of
thumb in the real estate industry
is that such expenditures typically consume about ten percent of rental
revenue.</span> More importantly, although nearly all&nbsp;land
gains are made fully taxable, there is little reason to assume that
physical deterioration should be compensated by a special allowance to
enable the landlord to
recover his capital investment within a given number of years.<br>
<br>
Even when <span style="font-style: italic;">overall </span>real
estate values fell in the early 1990s, the IRS nonetheless recorded
capital gains taken on properties built before the frantic price run-up
of the late 1980s. Over a fifteen year period, the value of the
building in our example might have been written down to near zero. If
it were sold for just its original purchase price, the entire sales
price of the building would be reported as a capital gain.<br>
<br>
Although the 1981 depreciation giveaway was replaced by the 1986
revision of the tax code, buildings already under construction and
about to come onto the rental market were grandfathered into the old
code. Significantly, today these buildings have been fully depreciated
and therefore are probably about to be sold, at least for book-keeping
purposes &#8212; owners may buy their own buildings under different
partnerships, or swap them for similar buildings with other owners.
Their new owners can begin to depreciate them all over again, after
duly paying capital gains taxes on the buildings&#8217; increase over their
near-zero book value. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">If they do not sell and
re-depreciate their buildings, the owners will have to begin paying
income taxes on their operating cash flow that hitherto was sheltered
by depreciation allowances that have now run out. This lends a renewed
note of urgency to the persistent campaign to cut capital gains tax
rates.</span><br>
<br>
Because excessive depreciation allowances favor real estate speculation
relative to industrial production, they discourage new direct
investment and employment. To reduce the capital gains tax &#8212; the only
significant remaining source of federal revenue from real estate &#8212;
would divert even more savings into the purchase and sale of existing
buildings. <br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="3._How_Mortgage_Debt_Converts_Rent_into"></a>3. How Mortgage
Debt Converts Rent into Interest<br>
<br>
</span>Depreciation rules are not the only reason why the real estate
sector declares little taxable income. Out of their gross rental
income, landlords pay state and local property taxes, a tiny modicum of
income tax, and interest on their mortgage debt. A large proportion of
cash flow is turned over to lenders as mortgage payments. Since the
early 1970s, interest paid by the real estate industry has been much
larger than the figures reported for net rental income. As Charts 3a,
3b, 3c, and 3d illustrate, real estate investors and homeowners have
become the financial sector&#8217;s prime customers. According to the Federal
Reserve Board, 1994 mortgage debt of $4.3 trillion represented some 46
percent of the economy's $9.3 trillion private nonfinancial debt, and a
third of the total $12.8 trillion U.S. debt.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">27</span></small> NIPA
statistics indicate that about 70 percent of loans to business
borrowers currently are made to the real estate sector, making it the

Most cash flow now ends up neither with developers nor with the tax
authorities, but as interest paid to banks, insurance companies and
other mortgage lenders. In fact, <span style="font-weight: bold;">mortgage
interest now absorbs seven
percent of national income, up from just one percent in the late 1940s</span>.
In 1993 (the most recent year for which NIPA statistics are available)
the real estate sector generated some $326 billion in interest
payments, more than it contributed in income taxes and state and local
property taxes together. Meanwhile, over the past half century, net
declarable income plus capital consumption allowances and property
taxes have been cut in half as a proportion of national income, from
over ten percent to less than five percent. Thus interest is the real
estate industry&#8217;s major cost, and as such, has helped to minimize the
real estate industry&#8217;s income tax liability.<br>
<br>
One effect of favorable depreciation and capital gains tax treatment is
to spur debt pyramiding for the real estate industry. The tax structure
provides a distortionary incentive for real estate holders to borrow
excessively, converting rental income into a nontaxable mortgage
interest cost while waiting for capital gains to accrue. This,
alongside financial deregulation of the nation&#8217;s S&amp;Ls, was a major
factor in the over-building spree of the 80's.<br>
<br>
In addition to paying interest to their bankers, real estate investors
turn over the capital consumption portion of their cash flow as loan
amortization payments. A major lesson from examining the NIPA accounts
is that creditors have ended up with both the mortgage interest and the
CCAs. Many investors operate at a nominal loss, and even on the margin
of solvency, leveraging their properties to the hilt. Their hope is to
ride the wave of increasing land values and &#8220;cash out&#8221; by selling their
property for more than they paid. In pursuit of this opportunity to
earn capital gains, they seek to control as much property as they can,
and are willing to forego current income in return.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, of course, no capital gains accrue. In some highly
conspicuous cases, landlords have walked away from their properties,
leaving their mortgage lenders holding the bag. This is what led to the
$500 billion FSLIC bailout by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.
Many smaller real estate parcels likewise were abandoned in central
city areas from New York to Los Angeles. Indeed, this process was part
of an international phenomenon, extending from Canary Wharf in London
to Tokyo&#8217;s Bubble Economy of 1985-1980. Nevertheless, holding onto
properties by paying off their mortgage loans is made easier by
favorable tax treatment. Indeed, nominal tax losses during 1984-91
enabled building investors not only to earn a rising cash flow, but to
gain tax credits to shelter their otherwise taxable income earned in
other sectors.<br>
<br>
Real estate is pledged to mortgage lenders as collateral in case the
promised interest payments fail to materialize. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Capital gains have been
collateralized into new and larger loans decade after decade,
increasing the mortgage burden that transforms rental income and
depreciation allowances into interest payments. Ultimately, the
financial rentiers end up with most of the cash flow which landlords &#8212;
and government tax collectors &#8212; relinquish.</span><br>
<br>
Tax-deductibility of mortgage costs does not impair government revenues
if mortgage lenders pay taxes on their interest income. Moreover,
lenders may be able to shift part of the tax burden to borrowers by
charging higher interest rates.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">29</span></small>
Actually, however, much interest income manages to avoid taxation, such
as that of banks adding to their loss coverage funds (or otherwise
offsetting their income) or individuals with tax shelters. The
insurance and financial industries have long obtained virtual tax
exemption for their income.<br>

interest is treated preferentially relative to other forms of interest,

immediately. Many take years of negotiation and litigation before they
are paid out. In fact, the courts in many states are notoriously backed
up by such litigation. Insurance company critics point out that by the
time many companies actually pay out on their claims, the delays have
saved them enough by deferment of income taxes to meet the entire cost.
Also, pension funds and non-profits do not have to pay income taxes or
capital gains taxes. (Non-profits include universities, which are major
real estate investors.) Mutual funds have fewer tax breaks, but mutual
funds for real estate typically are organized as real estate investment
trusts (REITs), which often generate tax losses for their investors to
charge against other income.<br>
<br>
The result is that the FIRE sector as a whole has been subsidized at
the expense of direct industrial investors and consumers. As Charts 4a,
4b, and 4c illustrate, compared to interest charges and property taxes,
the reported $150 billion in rental cash flow is relatively small. Net
taxable income is smaller yet. Just $24 billion in rental income (and
an $86 billion cash flow) was reported by small building owners, that
is, owners whose primary source of income was not real estate. $130
billion was earned by partnerships (the most common form of business
organization in the real estate industry), while real estate
corporations reported a $4 billion net loss (but a $3 billion net cash
flow) in 1993.<br>

Chart 5 tracks the relative growth of the finance, insurance, and real
estate sector using Labor Department employment figures. It shows that
what the classical economists called &#8220;productive&#8221; labor has remained
constant since 1929, while virtually all growth has been in government
(mainly state and local) and private sector services &#8212; mainly in the
FIRE
sector. Tax subsidies may largely explain why the FIRE sector has been
the most rapidly growing part of the economy over the past half
century. This is the conceptual context in which we should view the
NIPA statistics. <br>

</span>Tax rates on capital gains historically have been low compared
to income tax rates (Table 1). Even more important is the fact that
capital gains taxes are paid only at the time of realization, that is,
when the asset is sold, not as the gains actually accrue. The longer a
tax is deferred (and the higher is the imputed rate of interest), the
lower is its discounted present value.<br>

<br>
The effective rate is further reduced by numerous exclusions and
exemptions. With regard to real estate, for example, homeowners enjoy a
$125,000 exclusion for capital gains on sales of their primary homes,
as long as they recycle the proceeds into buying a new residence within
a year. Homeowners over 55 are permitted to sell their houses without
having to pay any tax on their capital gain, as long as they buy a new
residence of equal or higher value. The stated rationale for these
concessions is that to tax residential capital gains would make
homeowners pay taxes just to stay in the same economic position when
they move to take new jobs in other cities or to retire. President
Clinton&#8217;s recent proposal would further extend homeowners&#8217; tax
exclusions. <br>
<br>
No capital gains duties are levied on estates passing to heirs. Indeed,
inheritors of real estate may begin re-depreciating their
income-yielding buildings afresh at the new (typically higher) transfer
price. The estates bequeathed by the richest one percent of the
population (over $600,000
in value) are now taxed at a 55 percent rate if not sheltered, but of
course these are the estates most likely to shelter inheritance and
gift bequests. For instance, assets given as gifts are taxed only at
the time they come to be sold.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">30</span></small> If
the capital gains tax were reduced or abolished, the deferral would
become
permanent.<br>
<br>
Most capital gains reaped by business partnerships accrue to real
estate firms, which shelter personal income by avoiding incorporation.
IRS statistics ranking capital gains in terms of how long the assets
were held show that many of these gains represent quick &#8220;flips." Often
these are land that has been rezoned from a low-value to a high-value
use. Retaining the capital gains tax would have little effect on
deterring such speculation.<br>
<br>
Properties held for longer periods of time by these partnerships
typically are sold or swapped after having been fully depreciated.
Swaps&#8217; have long been permitted to the real, many almost perpetually
free of income taxation. The logic for this
loophole seems at first glance to be much like that for personal
homeowners&#8217; exemptions in selling a home to move somewhere else,
without having to pay a capital gain tax in the process; but the
analogy is specious. Homeowners cannot take a depreciation tax credit
unless their property generates rental income, and most do not generate
any income against which to claim CCAs<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">31</span></small>. In
contrast, the capital gains which commercial real estate investors
record for income-tax purposes are calculated, not merely on the gain
in the property&#8217;s market price (as with owner-occupied homes), but on
the excess of selling price over depreciated book value. <br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><font size="-1">31 Homeowners do receive imputed
rental income, which is not subject to the income tax.</font><br>
</small></div>
Major commercial real estate investors such as pension funds, insurance
companies and other large institutions are exempt from capital gains
taxes, as are foreign investors. In addition to playing a dominant role
in real estate, these institutional investors own nearly half of all
U.S. equities.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">32</span></small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 80px;"><small><font size="-1">32 Minarik (1992), p. 20.</font><br>
</small></div>
For similar reasons, Fazzari and Herzon note in a Levy Economics
Institute brief that &#8220;the &#8216;effective&#8217; year-to-year tax rate on capital
gains (sometimes called the &#8216;accrual-equivalent&#8217; tax rate) is actually
lower than the statutory rate."<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">33</span></small> They
estimate the effective rate by halving the statutory rate to account
for the numerous exclusions and exemptions and then halving it again to
reflect the benefits of deferring taxes to the time capital gains are
realized rather than paying upon accrual. If this is correct, then for
today&#8217;s 28 percent capital gains tax, the first halving produces an
effective tax rate of 14 percent; the second reduces it to just 7
percent. To cut the (statutory) rate to 14 percent, as Senator Dole
proposed, would reduce the effective capital gains tax rate to roughly
3.5 percent.<br>

</ul>
In view of the fact that real estate is the economy's largest asset
category &#8212; and land its major component &#8212; it is desirable to put the
capital gains debate in perspective by compiling adequate statistics to
trace land and building values.<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"> Unfortunately,
published statistics do not permit reliable estimates of capital gains
in real estate. The most recent benchmark for capital gains in the US
economy is an IRS sampling of capital gains </span><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">declarations on 1985
income tax returns</span>, prepared in connection with the Tax Reform
Act of 1986. By 1989-90 these data were analyzed in two studies.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">34</span></small>
Subsequent estimates have been published by the IRS in its Statistics
on Income, but cover only a portion of the capital gains spectrum.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">34 Holik, Hostetter and Labate
(1989 and also 1990).</font></small></div>
<small><br>
</small>The IRS benchmark survey estimated 1985 capital gains at $208
billion, an amount equal to only 6.4 percent of that year&#8217;s $3.3
trillion national income. An analysis of how these capital gains were
distributed as between land and buildings, plant and equipment, other
direct investment, and the stock market indicates that the economy's
capital gains are mostly in real estate, and in greater proportion than
the IRS benchmark study suggests. For properties sold during the year,
including the values embodied in stock-market equities, we interpret
the IRS survey as suggesting land value gains of about $97 billion
(Chart 6). This does not include institutional or foreign real estate
holdings, for these are not subject to taxation and thus were excluded
from the IRS sample. The IRS statistics show only what individual
persons who sold assets in 1985 were declaring on their tax returns.
Table 2 tracks land gains as a percentage of total reported capital
gains for the 1985 IRS data. <br>
<br>
Within these limitations of scope, sales of principal residences<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">35</span></small>
totaled $37 billion, accounting for 19 percent of the capital gains
sample. However, the statistics were swamped by the $125,000 exclusion
for capital gains on safes of owner-occupied homes. This exclusion was
so large, coming as it did just as the real estate bubble was peaking,
that it reduced the proportion of taxable capital gains accounted for
by residential sales from 19 percent to just 1.1 percent of the sample.<br>

Reported capital gains in real estate were understated as a result of
exclusions. On the other hand, much direct investment included the cost
of land, commercial buildings, and plant and equipment. Taking this
into account, we estimate that roughly 70 percent of the capital gains
calculated by the IRS for 1985 probably represent real estate. Even
this estimate may understate the role of land and real estate. In 1985,
anticipating the planned 1986 tax reform which would raise the capital
gains tax rate from 20 to 28 percent, many investors sold their
securities that had registered the largest advances. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Some 40 percent of the capital gains reaped
by selling these stocks probably represented real estate gains.</span>
A major spur to the LBO movement driving up the stock market was an
awareness that real estate gains were not being reflected in book
values and share prices;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">36</span></small> as
land prices leapt upward-funded in part by looser regulatory
restrictions on S&amp;L lending against land &#8212; raiders bought publicly
traded companies and sold off their assets, including real estate, to
pay off their junk-bond backers. In effect, not only were rental income
and profits being converted into a flow of interest payments; so also
were capital gains.<small><br>
</small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">36 See Chart 6 for the
assumptions made as to the IRS breakdown of capital gains, by industry.
This estimate closely approximates the Federal Reserve&#8217;s statistics for
land
and real estate improvements as a proportion of the US economy's net
assets.</font></small></div>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">THE FEDERAL RESERVE DATA</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>Federal Reserve Board statistics considerably outstrip the 1985 IRS
    estimate of $208 billion of taxable capital gains. The Fed&#8217;s Balance
    Sheets for the U.S. Economy lists the total value of land, buildings
    and other real assets. For produced capital, the annual increase in
    aggregate asset values does not distinguish capital gains on existing
    assets from the value of new production. For land, however, the value
    of new production must be zero, so the entire annual increase
    constitutes capital gains &#8212; accurately, land gains. According to the
    Fed,
    aggregate building values increased by $204 billion in 1985, while land
    prices rose by $356 billion, more than three and a half times the value
    implied by the IRS statistics. <br>
  <br>
  The Federal Reserve Board provides an implied estimate of land gains
    (and a measure of building gains that does not include
    over-depreciation pay-backs recorded fictitiously as capital gains) in
    its Z9 release estimating asset values throughout the economy. However,
    the IRS and Fed are not measuring capital gains in the same way. The
    Fed measures the overall nationwide market value of land and buildings,
    while the IRS&nbsp;<small></small>sample includes only properties sold
    during the year. Furthermore, the IRS statistics do not include capital
    gains on which no taxes are due because of exclusions.<br>
  <br>
  On the other hand, the Fed statistics<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">37</span></small> understate
    land values for methodological reasons. Starting with estimates for overall
    real estate market prices, Fed statisticians
    subtract estimated replacement prices for existing buildings and
    capital improvements to derive land values as a residual. These
    replacement prices are based on the Commerce Department&#8217;s index of
    construction costs. Thus, building values are estimated to increase
    steadily over time, on the implicit assumption that all such property
    is worth reproducing at today&#8217;s rising costs.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">37 Balance Sheets for the U.S.
  Economy, 1945-94, Tables B. 11, B. 12 and R 11.</font></small><font size="-1">  </font>  </div>
  <small><br>
  </small>However, the value of any building tends eventually to decline,
    until finally it is scrapped and replaced. It is the value of land
    which tends to rise as population and income grow (over the long run,
    with cyclical swings), precisely because no more land can be produced.
    Thus, capital gains in real estate result mainly from land appreciation.<br>
  <br>
  Building values fall because of physical deterioration, but also
    because buildings undergo locational obsolescence as neighborhood land
    uses change over time, so market prices tend to fall below replacement
    costs. It would not be economical to rebuild many types of structures
    on the same site if they were suddenly destroyed.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">38</span></small> In
    particular, where land use is intensifying over the long run, rising
    land values effectively drain the capital value out of old buildings.
    This is because the salvage value of land (its worth upon renewal)
    tends to rise, while the scrap or salvage value of most immovable
    improvements is negligible. Where land has alternative uses, rent is
    not its current net income but its opportunity cost &#8212; the minimum
    yield
    required by the market to warrant keeping the land in its present use
    instead of converting it to the best alternative use. As the land value
    rises, a rising share of the property income must be imputed to the
    land and a falling share remains to be imputed to the improvements.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">39</span></small><small><br>
    </small>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">38 Sometimes, to be
          sure, there is a renaissance, as when gentrification occurs. Land use
          is currently
      being shifted away from industry to residential development in the
      center of cities much the same way that it is being shifted away from
      agricultural uses to residential development at the outer margins of
      cities. However, gentrification comes because entire industrial areas
      have lost their value. In New York, it occurred in the Tribeca and Soho
      neighborhoods in southern Manhattan resulting in more than 10,000
      residential loft conversions during the city&#8217;s economic downturn in
      the 1970s. In Chicago, it occurring west of the Loop, and on the Near North
      Side.</font></small><font size="-1"><br>
      <small>39 Indeed, where ill-maintained old buildings occupy prime
      locations, a parcel may be more valuable once the building is
      demolished and the lot cleared for reuse See Gaffney (1993 and also
      1971). Some improvements, such as gas stations and refineries, are
      accompanied by ecological pollution, which can be analyzed as a
      negative improvement &#8212; the property would be worth more without it.
      Pollution may greatly increase the saIvage cost of land making it
      uneconomical to salvage some lands despite the value they would have if
      clean. This &#8220;brownfields&#8221; problem has received considerable public
      notice in recent months.</small></font><br>
  </div>
  Thus, the correct way to separate land values from building values is
    to appraise land values directly in terms of opportunity cost &#8212; how
    much
    would a vacant lot at that site fetch in the market? If the observed
    market value of the improved property exceeds the land value, the
    residual is the implied value of the standing improvements. The Fed&#8217;s
    land-residual method theoretically understates the land share of real
    estate values.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">40</span></small> The
    pitfall of this methodology is demonstrated to an almost comical degree
    by the fact that according to Fed statistics, the land component of
    corporately owned real estate has been reduced to near zero over the
    past five years (while the nominal reproduction costs of factories and
    other corporately held buildings are inflating).<br>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">40 Gaffney (1993).</font></small>  </div>
  <br>
  The measurement problem is exacerbated by assessment bias in many
    states and localities. Particularly where land values are trending
    upward, overestimates of building values relative to site values
    reflect the steady under-assessment of land. Note that as a larger
    share of real estate value is imputed to buildings, a larger share of
    cash flow can be claimed as depreciation. In effect, assessment bias
    allows investors to partly depreciate land, at no cost to local
    government budgets.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">41</span></small><small><br>
    </small>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">41 Studies cited by
          Gaffney (1993) of assessed building values at
      demolition indicate a tendency of assessors, too, to overvalue
      depreciable improvements. At the moment of demolition for example, a
      building&#8217;s value equals its scrap value (if any) minus the cost of
      demolition. The result can easily be negative. That is, the cleared
      land may be worth more than the parcel is worth with the old building
      standing and its cleanup costs yet to be borne. The IRS may question
      specific building appraisals, but the general practice is to accept the
      local city assessment, which tends to favor buildings over land It is
      well known that Fed statistics on the value of corporate land and
  buildings show an unrealistic low valuation of land.</font></small>  </div>
  <br>
  Official statistics should provide a sense of proportion as to how the
    economy works. Especially when it comes to real estate, however,
    national income statistics tend to obfuscate more than they reveal.
    They are the product of income-tax filings, and hence are distorted for
    both administrative and political reasons; they do not reflect
    fundamental categories of economic analysis. One searches in vain, for
    example, for an estimate of the distribution of total income among
    land, labor, and capital, or for an accounting of how rentier claims on
    revenue and output are layered upon directly productive enterprise.  <small></small><br>
  <br>
  <span style="font-weight: bold;"><a
 name="6._The_Political_Context_of_Real_Estate"></a>6. The Political
    Context of Real Estate Taxation<br>
  <br>
  </span>Much of the public discussion of capital gains policy has been
    conducted with little reference to empirical research as to their
    actual character and composition in the US economy. Capital gains, and
    savings in general, are defended on the assumption that they are
    automatically transformed into new direct investment. Yet the more
    layers has the debt pyramid, the smaller is the proportion of savings
    used to finance direct investment. Moreover, our investigation suggests
    that a large and expanding share of the economy's capital gains &#8212; as
    they are defined, measured and taxed &#8212; has little discernible impact
    on net investment or employment.<br>
  <br>
  IRS estimates of capital gains measure only the small proportion that
    individuals are obliged to declare after all the exemptions and
    exclusions have been utilized. There is no estimate of the volume of
    capital gains generated each year, and no adequate breakdown as to
    where these gains occur. This statistical lacuna means that the
    economic cost of assorted tax loopholes is not being calculated. <span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">There is no sound
    statistical basis for calculating the total returns being taken by
    investors, or the proportion of those returns paid in </span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">taxes.<br>
    <br>
    </span>When statistics are lacking, it often is because some interest
    groups are benefiting in ways they prefer not to see quantified and
    publicized. If land assessments lag behind actual increases in market
    value, for instance, land speculators, as well as homeowners, will pay
    less than their legislated tax share. Also &#8212; and of direct relevance
    to
    our thesis &#8212; the failure to distinguish statistics on land values and
    other real estate gains from non-real-estate capital gains in industry
    and finance makes it easier for the real estate industry to get its own
    taxes reduced along with industries in which capital gains tax cuts do
    indeed tend to spur productivity.<br>

  Academic economists likewise have been remarkably slow to address this
    shift away from earned income to capital gains. It is true that
    nineteenth-century land reformers such as John Stuart Mill and Leon
    Wahas defined land-value gains as an &#8220;unearned increment,&#8221; and
    urged that they be collected by the community at large, whose economic
    activity was, after all, responsible for creating these gains. Ever
    since Henry George brought matters to a head in <span
 style="font-style: italic;">Progress and Poverty</span> (1879),
    however, economics has largely dropped the analysis of land-value
    gains, and indeed, of land itself<small><span

  </span></small>Wealthy investors have won congressional support for
    real estate exemptions in large part by mobilizing the economic
    ambitions of homeowners. Most families&#8217; major asset, after all, is
    their home. Two Federal Reserve studies trace the rise in gross house
    value from 26 percent of household wealth in 1962 to 30.1 percent in
    1983 (falling back to 28.5 percent in 1989).<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">43</span></small>
  Household real estate assets substantially exceeded holdings of stocks,
    bonds and trust funds (20.5 percent in 1989), liquid assets (17
    percent) and total debt (14 percent).<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">44</span></small> The
    giveaway to real estate interests is thus presented ostensibly as a
    popular middle class measure. The real estate industry (and the
    financial sector riding on its shoulders) have found that the middle
    classes are willing to cut taxes on the wealthy considerably, as long
    as their own taxes are cut even lightly. It is no surprise that
    President Clinton&#8217;s first major concession to the pressure for cutting
    capital gains taxation is directed at homeowners, despite the fact that
    preferences for home ownership cannot be justified as a boost to
    entrepreneurial investment. Such is the foreshortened economic
    perspective of our times.<br>

  The LBO movement epitomizes the real estate industry&#8216;s strategy,
    applying the developer&#8217;s traditional debt-pyramiding techniques to
    the buying and selling of manufacturing companies. Raiders emulated
    developers who borrowed money to buy or construct buildings and make
    related capital improvements, agreeing to pay interest to their
    mortgage bankers or other lenders, putting down as little equity of
    their own as possible. Having set things in motion, the landlord uses
    the rental income to carry the interest, principal, taxes and
    maintenance charges while he waits for a capital gain to accrue. The
    idea is to amortize the loan as slowly as possible so as to minimize
    annual carrying charges, while paying them out of the CCA.<br>
  <br>
  For many decades securities analysts have pored over corporate balance
    sheets in search of undervalued real estate whose book value does not
    reflect gains in market value. From the merger and acquisition movement
    of the 1960s through the takeover wave of the&nbsp;1980s,
    the raider&#8217;s strategy has been to borrow money to buy the target
    company&#8217;s stock, and then sell off its real estate and other assets to
    repay the creditors, hoping that something will be left for himself
    after settling the debts incurred in the process. For the bankers and
    other creditors, LBOs were a way to put savings to work earning higher
    rates of interest.&nbsp; The ensuing junk bond commotion pushed
    interest rates over 15 percent for high-risk securities, whose major
    risk was that quick capital gains and the cash flow available from
    re-depreciating properties would not cover the interest payments to the
    institutional investors rounded up by Drexel Burnham and the other
    investment bankers who underwrote the takeovers.<br>
  <br>
  The object of building, like buying and selling companies, is thus by
    no means only to earn rental income. Most cash flow is pledged to
    lenders as debt service in any case. In a world of income taxation
    subject to loopholes, sophisticated investors aim not so much to make
    profits as to reap capital gains -not only in the stock and bond
    markets, but also in real estate, other natural resources, and the
    monopoly privileges that have come to underlie much of the pricing of
    securities today.<br>
  <br>
  As developers borrow money to finance real estate purchases, lenders,
    for their part, use the real estate sector as a market to absorb and
    service the economy's mounting stock of savings, applying most of the
    rental cash flow to pay interest to savers. The end result is that most
    total returns are taken by the wealthiest ten percent responsible for
    nearly all the economy's net saving. Viewing US economic statistics
    from this perspective shows that not to calculate capital gains in the
    national income accounts alongside directly &#8220;earned&#8221; income helps
    foster the illusion that more equality exists among Americans than
    actually is the case. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The fact is
    that earned income is more equally distributed than unearned gains. </span><br>
  <br>
  This distinction between real estate (and by extension, other natural
    resource industries and monopolies) and the rest of the economy helps
    explain the familiar economic rule that inequalities of wealth tend
    historically to exceed inequalities of income. The reason is that the
    wealthiest layers of society control even more of the economy's assets
    &#8212; and the capital gains on these assets &#8212; than they do its income.
    They
    also obtain a larger proportion of cash flow and other non-taxable
    income than they do of taxable &#8220;earned&#8221; income. <br>
  <br>
  This phenomenon has long been known, but not well explained. Edward
    Wolff has shown that wealth is more unequally distributed than income,
    but he leaves capital gains out of account in explaining how the
    American economy has grown more top-heavy.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">45</span></small> It is
    unequal wealth that is primarily responsible for generating inequality
    of incomes. The more the returns to wealth can avoid taxation by being
    categorized as capital gains, the faster this inequality will polarize
    society.<br>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">45 Wolff (1995), p.
          27. &#8220;The top
      one percent of wealth holders
      has typically held in excess of one-quarter of total household wealth,
      in comparison to the 8 or 9 percent share of income received by the top
      percentile of the income distribution. &#8221;</font></small><br>
  </div>
  <small>  </small>Given the current US depreciation laws and related
    institutions, to lower the capital gains tax rate across the board is
    to steer capital and entrepreneurial resources into a search for
    unearned rather than earned income. It rewards real estate speculators
    and corporate raiders as it shifts the burden of taxation to people
    whose primary source of income is their labor. The budget crisis
    aggravated by such a policy also ends up forcing public resources to be
    sold off to meet current expenses &#8212; sold to the very wealth-holders
    being
    freed from taxation. In this way wealth consolidates its economic power
    relative to the rest of society, and translates it into political power
    so as to shit? the tax burden onto the shoulders of others. The first
    element of this strategy has been to defer revenue into channels that
    are taxed only later, as capital gains. The second has been to tax
    these gains at a lower rate than earned income &#8212; a&nbsp; fight that
    has broken
    out in earnest following the 1996 presidential elections.<br>

  Policy Conclusions</span><br>
  Because real estate investors make much of their money by buying and
    reselling existing properties, much as financial investors buy already
    seasoned stocks and bonds, many real estate and stock transactions have
    no new employment or direct investment effects regardless of the
    capital gains incentives being offered. Yet the tax code permits real
    estate investors to take their returns mainly in the form of capital
    gains and declare little taxable ordinary income. FIRE sector investors
    in the finance and insurance industries also have taken their income in
    ever more lightly taxed forms. These tax subsidies divert effort and
    ingenuity out of productive channels and into speculation on already
    existing buildings and land, or already issued stocks and bonds. An
    across-the-board cut in capital gains taxes would favor the FIRE sector
    rather than manufacturing, steering investment money further from
    active to passive investment. Far greater stimulus to productivity is
    to be expected from, instead, eliminating special privileges and
    closing loopholes &#8212; while reducing taxes on payrolls, sales, and
    enterprise.<br>
  <br>
  Adam Smith and subsequent classical economists defined some forms of
    investment and income as being more productive than others, suggesting
    a normative basis for evaluating legislation on the basis of economic
    efficiency and productivity. Although there was disagreement as to
    details, <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">it was
    the essence of classical political economy to distinguish productive
    from unproductive investment.</span> Productive investment added to
    revenue, employment and wealth. Unproductive investment, what today
    would be called zero-sum transactions, merely redistributed income.<br>
  <br>
  The classical economists distinguished the earned income of capital and
    labor from what they deemed <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">unearned </span>income,
    mainly in the form of land rent and, by extension, the rent of public
    monopolies as well as mines and other natural resources. They applauded
    industrial profits and other returns to the factors of production; they
    frowned on the <span style="font-style: italic;">rentier </span>takings
    that burdened productive effort. Profits, they believed, tended to be
    recycled into new investment, employing yet more labor to increase
    output, while <span style="font-style: italic;">rentier </span>income
    was a kind of economic overhead. A fundamental problem was the tendency
    of rent to be dissipated on consumption expenditures to maintain the
    rentier lifestyle, for example, to support a retinue of servants who
    absorbed income rather than generating new growth in revenue. The
    industrialists, by contrast, tended to recycle their revenue back into
    new capital formation. By the time of John Stuart Mill, the mainstream
    of British political economy defined &#8220;capital gains&#8221; in land
    and real estate as economically sterile. <br>
  <br>
  Thus the classical view of economics was no law of the jungle. It
    endorsed an institutional shaping of the market place so that economic
    self-interest would serve society&#8217;s long-term objectives. Self-interest
    was the mainspring, but just as every watch needs controls and release
    ratchets, self-interest had to be harnessed in service to the general
    welfare and steered away from unproductive or corrosive activities. <br>
  <br>
  The after-tax earnings of labor and enterprise constitute incentives
    for markets to expand economic horizons. They generate more taxes in
    the process, as well as more wealth. Such is not the case with forms of
    wealth appropriation that constitute zero- or negative-sum transfers
    from consumers, workers and other taxpayers to corporate raiders,
    privatizers, real estate speculators or outright crooks.<br>
  <br>
  Two Republican presidential hopefuls, Steve Forbes and Lamar Alexander,
    sought unsuccessfully to win voter support in the primaries by
    advocating a flat-rate tax with just a few exceptions. The exceptions
    were mortgage interest &#8212; on the ground that taxing it would reduce the
    value of much of the nation&#8217;s real estate, by forcing some strapped
    homeowners to sell &#8212; and capital gains. <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Yet these are two of
    the most parasitic ways of getting rich. </span>Bank credit was
    distorted throughout the 1980s, away from financing real estate trades
    in preference to direct industrial investment and employment.
    Speculators borrowed money to buy buildings, agreeing to pay their
    rental income to the banker (or S&amp;L, insurance company or other
    mortgage lender) at the taxpayer&#8217;s expense.<br>
  <br>
  Taxation of capital gains is widely attacked as a &#8220;soak the rich&#8221;
  scheme, a program of wealth redistribution that will adversely affect
    growth in productivity and efficiency. Kurt Hauser&#8217;s Wall Street
    Journal editorial counters this with the observation that <span
 style="font-style: italic;">over half of all taxpayers</span>
  reporting capital gains have adjusted gross incomes of under $50,000,
    implying that a tax cut would not preferentially benefit the wealthy. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">He neglects to observe, however, that the
    poorer half of taxpayers account for less than ten percent of the total
    dollar value of capital gains<small><small><span
 style="font-style: italic;">46</span></small></small> &#8212; or</span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> that the capital gains tax is virtually
    the only remaining federal levy on real estate income.</span> <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">Low capital gains tax rates and
    the
    tax deductibility of mortgage interest have contributed to the
    polarization of wealth distribution.</span> A further reduction in the
    capital
    gains rate would worsen this maldistribution by making real estate
    virtually tax-free except for local property taxes, which fell from
    10 percent to just 7.4 percent of all taxes at all levels of government
    between 1955 and 1989.<small><span

 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">48</span></small> The
    implication is that any resulting growth in income inequality is the
    price a free society must pay for an efficient system of economic
    incentives. Indeed, it would be difficult to oppose widely shared
    progress simply because the rich are gaining faster than the rest of
    society. <span style="font-weight: bold;">The point, however, is that
    the tax code encourages the wealthy to enrich themselves in ways that
    are detrimental to the economy at large</span>. The presumed trade-off
    between equity and efficiency is mythical, at least with respect to
    real estate under the current federal tax code.<br>

  An inordinate focus on stock market gains &#8212; especially the selection
    of small industrial companies such as a yacht producer just making his
    first stock offering &#8212; diverts attention from the extent to which a
    low capital gains tax benefits real estate investors preferentially.
    The irony of casting the issue in terms of the stock market rather than
    real estate investment is that financial investors have already devised
    an array of strategies to evade taxation on stock gains. Institutional
    investors already are exempt from capital gains taxes on securities, as
    they are on their real estate holdings. Wealthy individual investors
    can arrange fictitious &#8220;short&#8221; sales (&#8220;sales against the box&#8221;),
    obtaining the proceeds of their stocks without having to actually sell
    them, by collateralizing them with a bank and borrowing an amount of
    money equal to the value of the stocks. This is the equivalent of a
    sale, for it provides immediate proceeds &#8212; but without incurring taxes
    on the securities&#8217; rise in value. Bankers find this a lucrative
    business, while the Treasury foregoes revenue at the expense of less
    affluent taxpayers. To abolish capital gains taxes would enable these
    fictitious &#8220;against the box&#8221; maneuverings finally to be liquidated
    without having paid any taxes. Also freed would be the accumulated
    over-depreciation of buildings that has sheltered past real estate
    income.<br>
  <br style="font-weight: bold;">
  <span style="font-weight: bold;">If the intention is to provide an
    incentive for new direct investment, employment, and industrial
    modernization, then an across-the-board capital gains tax cut is at
  best a blunt policy instrument.</span> We have examined several reasons
    to doubt that further cuts in capital gains taxes will have a
    pronounced incentive effect on new direct investment.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">49</span></small>
  Capital gains tend to reward accumulation of old assets more than
    production of new wealth. The stock market is mostly a second-hand
    market, but we do not lean too hard on this point because the
    (discounted) anticipation of future capital gains may boost the demand
    for new stock issues, making it somewhat easier for corporations to
    finance new investment. The main point is that most taxable capital
    gains represent appreciation of non-produced land and of structures
    built years ago. In the current institutional setting, real estate
    gains are artificially inflated by generous depreciation rules, which
    apply not only to newly constructed buildings but also to second-hand
    buildings and even, effectively, to land, which neither depreciates nor
    is replaced. As long as these and other rules are in place, an
    across-the-board capital gains tax cut will preferentially benefit real
    estate and financial speculation at the expense of industrial
    production. It will also increase the federal budget deficit,
    ultimately at the expense of lower- and middle-income taxpayers.<br>
  <div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">49 A capital gains tax
          cut may relieve a lock-in effect caused by
      taxing capital gains upon realization instead of accrual. However,
      Gaffney (199 l), p. 50, writes that &#8220;the locked-in effect results
  mainly from stepup at death, rather than from a high rate per se.&#8221;</font></small>  </div>
  <small><br>
  </small>One reason often cited for taxing capital gains at lower rates
    than ordinary income is to exempt &#8220;phantom income&#8221; arising from
    inflation. The logic of indexing is that if prices rise by, say, 50
    percent between the time of purchase and the time of sale, then this
    amount should not be taxed; to do so would be to tax investors just for
&#8220;staying in place.&#8221; However, inflation erodes all monetary assets,
  not just capital gains,<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">50</span></small> and
    may erode the purchasing power of labor income, as has occurred for
    most wage-earners in recent years. Equity in the face of inflation is
    thus a poor argument for preferential capital
    gains tax rates. <br>
  <small>   <font size="-1">50 Gaffney (1991), pp. 49-53. Inflation amounts to
  a general wealth tax.</font></small><br>
  <br>
  Four conclusions for federal tax policy are summarized below, ranked in
    ascending order as to the confidence with which we offer them.<br>
<p></p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>DO NOT REDUCE CAPITAL GAINS TAXES ON BUILDINGS.</strong></li>
</ul>We agree with the major premise that to reduce taxation the earnings of
productive enterprise has beneficial incentive effects. However, given
fiscal
rules permitting excess depreciation of buildings to be recovered by
deferred capital gains
taxation at preferential rates, the tax code subsidizes speculation in
existing properties more
than it stimulates new production. As real estate developers know,
construction responds more
to shifts in interest rates than to adjustments in the capital gains
tax rate. Capital
consumption allowances absorb nearly all the rental cash flow left
after paying mortgage
interest, making cash flow virtually exempt from income taxes. Because
foreign investors and
institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance companies
are not subject to
capital gains taxes, a tax cut would not Sect their real estate
operations in any event.<br>
<ul style="font-weight: bold;">
  <li>DO NOT PERMIT BUILDINGS TO BE DEPRECIATED MORE THAN ONCE.</li>
</ul>
The only point at which much of the real estate industry now pays taxes
on its accumulated cash flow after taking capital consumption
write-offs is
when the building is sold. To let the building be depreciated all over
again is to transform
what should be a current income tax liability into a deferred capital
gains tax. This
gives the real estate industry a unique gift. Deferral of tax liability
from the time when
rental income actually is earned until the time when the building is
sold enables the property to
avoid paying its fair share of income taxes, transmuting ordinary
income into a capital gain
that is taxed at a far lower effective rate than ordinary income. This
deferral nearly doubles
the private rate of return on investment.<br>
<br>
As long as capital consumption allowances give the real estate industry
a peculiarly generous income tax status, real estate investors will do
what they can
to impute an excessive proportion of total real estate value to
depreciable
improvements.<small><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">51</span></small>
Moreover, as long as real estate income is effectively exempted from
the income tax,
a powerful lobby will continue the drive to substitute income taxes for
state and local
property taxes.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">52</span></small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">51 Local assessors frequently
appear to act in collusion with
landowners: Gaffney (1993).</font></small><font size="-1"><br>
<small>52 An ad valorem tax on land values would recapture that part of
the
real estate value which is created by the surrounding community. While
taxes on produced wealth tend to
discourage the reproduction of such wealth, well-administered taxes on
the market value or annual rent of
land are among the least intrusive forms of taxation. They generate no &#8220;excess burden of taxation&#8221; and
discourage neither the production nor the economic use of land
(Tideman, 1994, p. 135). They reduce the
incentive to speculate, and induce more intensive use of valuable
lands. They cannot be shifted to tenants or
consumers, and they do not erode their own tax bases. Both efficiency
and equity are therefore well served by
focusing taxes on land values. High land taxes would also help counter
the widespread tendency to
over-assess buildings (and hence, to increase their permitted CCA)
relative to land</small></font><br>
</div>
<ul style="font-weight: bold;">
  <li>DO NOT REDUCE CAPITAL GAINS TAXES ON LAND.</li>
</ul>
Land is created by nature, not by human investors. Much of the value of
land, especially urban land, is determined by its location with respect
to
surrounding public and private infrastructure, other capital, and
activities of all kinds.
Land value is not produced by the investment of individual landowners
and users (they contribute
the improvements).<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">53 </span></small>Therefore,
to the extent that taxable capital gains are really land
value gains, cutting the &#8220;capital&#8221; gains tax deters no new capital
formation. On the contrary,
to cut taxes on land gains is to encourage land speculation, inducing
less intensive use of
central lands and thereby raising the public, private, and
environmental costs associated
with a sprawling, inefficient pattern of land use.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">54 </span></small>It
is also to accelerate
rent-seeking activities, which consume resources in the service of
redistribution, not production.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">55<br>
</span></small>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">53 Macro-developments where
developers build entire towns or
neighborhood enclaves are sometimes understood to increase land rent in
the sense that they internalize
location externalities; this may reflect inconsistency in the
definition of a land parcel for assessment
purposes (Feder, 1993, pp. 83-105). Most such cases are urban or
suburban redevelopments that involve large
public subsidies, with public land turned over at concessionary prices
and with generous tax abatements
(of-ten to large institutional investors who are politically
well-connected).<br>

</div>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF
STATISTICS AND REFORM NIPA ACCOUNTING PRACTICES.</span></li>
</ul>
Estimates of capital gains from various sources are not easily found.
The accounting methodology frustrates attempts to measure the total
return to
investors, which includes asset appreciation as well as current income.
Statistics based on tax
returns conceal and thereby perpetuate real estate tax loopholes.<br>
<br>
Presently, US statistics appear to undervalue land by at least a
trillion dollars (at about $4 trillion, down from the $5 trillion
estimated in 1990). The
Federal Reserve method of calculating land and improvement values by
estimating a building&#8217;s
reproduction cost is inappropriate. The market value of land should be
evaluated
independently, rather than derived by subtracting the hypothetical
replacement cost of buildings
from market real estate values. The theoretically correct approach is
the
building-residual method of real estate assessment, as we noted in
Section 5. One result of consistently
applying the building-residual method would be to raise the land share
and lower the
building share of assessed property value, and thus narrow the
depreciation loophole.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">56</span></small><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><font size="-1">56 Gaffney (1993). Also, land
and buildings are frequently assessed
in a scattershot pattern, with land for </font></small><font size="-1"><small>contiguous
parcels showing abrupt drop-offs or jumps. An entire
profession of appraisal litigators has arisen; lawyers
can get their clients&#8217; property taxes reduced simply by
finding some seemingly similar low-valued properties.
Such practices contribute to sharply under-valuing land in
many areas. To overcome this administrative problem,
smooth, continuous land value maps should be
created using geographic information systems computer
technology, and should be continuously
updated using land sales data. More frequent
reassessment, especially in areas with rapidly appreciating
land values, would tend to increase property tax
revenues and probably also to increase the land share of
the total assessment.</small></font></div>
<p><br>
  It can only confuse matters to debate capital gains taxes without
separately considering three major sources: real estate as the
economy's largest
recorder of capital gains (separable in turn into land and
improvements); other direct
capital investment; and financial claims on the income generated by
this capital (stocks,
bonds, and packaged bank loans that are &#8220;securitized&#8221;). In the real
estate sector, most &#8220;capital
gains&#8221; in the colloquial sense of rising market prices accrue to land,
but IRS statistics mainly
catch the landlord&#8217;s fictitious declaration of the loss in building
values through
over-depreciation. The present GNP/NIPA format fails to differentiate
carefully among land, produced
wealth, and financial claims.<br>

distribution, an attack by have-nots on the haves, to the fundamental
issues. What ways of getting
income deserve fiscal encouragement, and how may economic surpluses
best be tapped to
support government needs? <span style="font-weight: bold;">Policies
that subsidize <span style="font-style: italic;">rentier </span>incomes
while
penalizing productive effort have grave implications, not only for
distributive justice and
social harmony, but also for economic efficiency and growth.</span><br>
