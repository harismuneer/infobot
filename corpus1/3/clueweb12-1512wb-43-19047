How Crufts became the biggest dog show in the world
&lt;br&gt;
Article By: Isla Campbell
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Crufts was named after its founder, Charles Cruft, who worked for a dog biscuit manufacturer and spent considerable time travelling to dog shows both in the UK and internationally. This allowed him to establish contacts throughout the world, as well as help him understand the need for higher standards in dog shows. This in turn led to Cruft promoting his first dog show in 1886, the &quot;First Great Terrier Show&quot;, which featured 57 classes of dog and 600 entries from around the country.

Five years later, the first show named &quot;Crufts&quot; - &quot;Crufts Greatest Dog Show&quot; - was held at the Royal Agricultural Show in Islington. This was the first show where all breeds were allowed to compete, resulting in 2,000 dogs and almost 2,500 entries. This number rose with the close of the 19th century, with entries reaching 3,000 and including royal patronage from various European countries and Russia. The popularity of the show continued to grow until Charles Cruft&#39;s death in 1938.

Following Cruft&#39;s death, his widow continued to run the show for the next four years. However, the high demands of time and effort required to keep the show running eventually became too much for her and, in an effort to preserve the reputation of the show and her husband&#39;s work, she sold the show to the Kennel Club.

The first Crufts show held under the new owner occurred in 1948 and continued to grow in popularity with each passing year. In 1959, despite an increase in entrance fees, the show set a new world record with 13,211 entrants and, by 1979, the show had to be moved to Earls Court in London as the increasing amount of entries and spectators had outgrown the capacity of the previous venue, Olympia. Just three years later in 1982 the show had to be changed again due to its massive popularity, with the duration of the show being increased to three days. It was later increased to four days in 1987.

1991 saw Crufts celebrate its Centenary. The occasion was marked by another change of venue, with the show moving to its current home, the NEC in Birmingham. It was also this year that the Guinness Book of Records officially recognised Crufts as the largest dog show in the world with 22,973 dogs being exhibited in conformation classes that year. It is estimated that 30,000 dogs take part in Crufts every year with 150,000 human visitors attending the event.

In 2007,  153,000 spectators filled the NEC over the four days of competition, attending not only to see the finest breeds of dogs in the world but also to wander around the various stalls selling a vast array of dog related merchandise and advertising various pet related charities and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www6.marksandspencer.com/pages/default.asp?PageId=home&amp;Product=PI&quot;&gt;pet insurance&lt;/a&gt; companies. Rather astoundingly, the popularity of Crufts has not diminished at all during its illustrious 117 years, with all signs indicating that it will continue to be the world&#39;s premier dog show for many years to come.
