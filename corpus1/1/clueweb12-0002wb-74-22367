      <h3><b>ON READING LYRIC POETRY </b></h3>
      </center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enjoyment of lyric poetry, like
enjoyment of any other genre, depends in part on knowledge of its
conventions. To what extent are these familiar or unfamiliar? What
do we already know that can make us very comfortable with reading
a lyric poem?
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are in fact familiar with
two
kinds of popular "texts" that bear some similarity to and have some
of the same "feel" as lyric poetry. We also know how to recognize
a lyric poem when we see one (more important than we might at first
think), as well as how, in general, we are expected to read it.
Finally, we know more about two of its special conventions,
"stanza" form and the "speaker," than we may realize. </p>

      <h3><b>Lyric Poetry and Familiar Popular "Texts" </b></h3>
      </center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lyric poetry makes its impact in a
very brief space. It stresses moments of feeling. It is often quite
memorable. In these and several other ways, lyric poems resemble
two other kinds of "texts" with which we are quite familiar:
ninety-second popular songs and fifteen-second television
commercials. Both of these aim, in extremely brief time, to capture
moments of feeling. Both aim to imprint themselves in our memory.
To achieve this, besides repeated air play, both use internal forms
of repetition.
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In pop songs, there is a strong
emphasis on rhythm, on "the beat," a very basic way of using
repetition to aid memory. The best songs also use striking images
and are about subjects that concern us. They may relate a memorable
incident and tell of its lasting emotional implications. Refrains,
catch phrases, and other verbal devices invite us to remember the
specific words so that we will sing them--as the record is being
played, afterwards to ourselves, and finally on our way to the
record store. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Television commercials also
present
striking images, sometimes in very quick sequence--a series of
"poetic" fragments that try to associate the particular product
with a feeling or goal that is highly valued (friendship, health,
social status, or love). Some of the best are like mini-dramas,
telling brief, emotionally appealing "stories." A first-born child,
disturbed by all the fuss over a newly arrived baby, says
plaintively, "I have blue eyes too"; he is taken by his father to
MacDonald's, for a "man-to-man talk," where a new role is offered
to him, to be a teacher of the younger child. A teen-age girl
complains tearfully to her friends about her mother--"She's so much
prettier than me"--until she smiles, realizing that at the same
age, her mother looked "exactly like me." Accompanying these
commercials, there is also a strong musical element, either as
background or as a catchy tune with catchy words to it. To sell
the product, story and music and verbal devices all aim at being
memorable. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The earliest poetry of every
culture
also aimed at being remembered. It had to. Without the resources of
mass printing, it could only survive through oral transmission.
There were many repeat performances. Mnemonic verbal devices, a
"story" which engaged the concerns and values of the culture, and
strong musical elements existed here too (the poems were sung or
chanted to musical accompaniment). Medieval popular ballads were
not printed until the fifteenth century. These were generally
story-songs
that used refrains, as well as "incremental repetition" (lines that
change only slightly in each appearance). </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our pop songs and commercials
today
are in part the inheritors of ballad and other popular traditions.
But they also echo more consciously "literary" forms (in literary
history, there is constant exchange). In particular, they use two
conventions of lyric poetry which developed in the nineteenth
century. First, as the lyric moved "up" in the hierarchy of
literary genres, the objects and situations it described
"descended," became more commonplace, more everyday. This was one
of Wordsworth's major innovations. Second, the place of "action" or
"story," of primary importance in literature since Aristotle,
shifted. Feelings became primary. Wordsworth said that feelings
gave importance to the action and situation, not the other way
around. Both of these conventions of the nineteenth century lyric--
emphasis on everyday events and on a "story" that exists mostly for
the feelings it expresses--may be seen operating in a great many
commercials and popular songs today (think of any Country and
Western song). </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To sum up, because we are
familiar
with these brief, popular "texts," we may, in a general way, be
more familiar than we realize with the conventions and codes of
lyric poetry. </p>

      <h3><b>Lyric Poetry: The Conventions We Already Know </b></h3>
      </center>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In lyric poetry, there are some very
basic conventions that we already "know," without even thinking
about them. What would most of us expect to see in a lyric poem?
How would we expect to read it?
