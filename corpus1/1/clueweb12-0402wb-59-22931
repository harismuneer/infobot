  <h1>Simonides' Foil</h1>
  <h2>Michael W. Boler</h2>
<h3>Fordham University</h3>
  <p>In Poem
    38 Catullus states, 'paulum quid lubet allocutionis/ maestius lacrimis Simonideis'.&nbsp; These
    lines of Catullus, along with other sources from antiquity, illustrate one
    of the common judgments about Simonides, his mastery of 'pathos'.&nbsp; With
    a cursory glance at the surviving fragments this judgment seems to be borne
    out, most notably in the dirges (PMG 520, PMG 521).&nbsp; These fragments
    state that man is weak, his exploits vain, and that the same fate follows
    both good and wicked men.&nbsp; Simonides seems to be making a much stronger
    statement than the typical notion about the vicissitude of human life, a
    view which stands in stark contrast to his other surviving works.&nbsp; Simonides'
    role in the pioneering, if not invention, of epinician poetry, along with
    his celebratory poems contradict the belief that he saw only despair and
    futility in human existence.&nbsp; However, pessimism is not a genre and
    it is fair to ask for what purpose the poems from which we have such fragments
    were written.&nbsp; The above mentioned fragments are agreed by most to be
    excerpts from dirges.&nbsp; If Simonides was commissioned to write poems,
    as he is known to have been, surely his patrons must have expected from him
    something other than morbid reflections on the frailty of human existence.&nbsp; What
    small evidence we do have on the dirge as a genre suggests that consolation
    and the praising of the dead were integral parts of the form.&nbsp; I will
    argue that fragements such as PMG 520 and PMG 521 can be read as foil to
    encomiastic elements of the poem which did not survive.&nbsp; Lyric poets
    whose work has survived in more complete form express the same sentiments
    as these fragments of Simonides.&nbsp; The same conclusions could very well
    be made about specific lines of Pindar (O.1.114, O.3.42-45, O.7.94-95, P.3.104-105)
    if we did not have the entire poems which give these lines their proper context.&nbsp; An
    investigation into a few of the well attested fragments of Simonides will
    reveal that fragments which appear at face value to be laments on the powerlessness
    of mankind and the impossibility of accomplishments other than the mere avoidance
    of evil could in fact be read as foil to the achievements of those whom he
    praised.&nbsp; Once the possibility of contrary readings are acknowledged,
    the gulf in sentiment between the fragments will narrow, and a more balanced
    view of Simonides will emerge.</p>
