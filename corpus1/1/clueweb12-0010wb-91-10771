<b>The Partiality of Indexing Capital
Gains</b>
<p>by Mason Gaffney</p>
</center>
<blockquote>Paper presented at 1990 Annual Conference, National Tax
Association, San Francisco, November 11-14, 1990. Published in
Proceedings of the 83rd Annual Conference on Taxation of the NTA-TIA,
Columbus, Ohio, 1991, pp. 49-53. </blockquote>
<p>In 1986 Congress made realized capital gains fully taxable, in the
spirit of uniformity animating the 1986 reform. The effect on gains
taxes was largely offset, to be sure, when Congress&#127; lowered the top
rate from 50% to 28%, abandoning 70 years of rate progressivity.
Congress also lowered the corporate tax rate. Nonetheless, the change
did overturn a long tradition of excluding half or more of gains from
taxable income. No special concern was shown for the phantom income
element in nominal capital gains.</p>
<p>Now we are witnessing a major effort to revive the exclusion
of part or all of capital gains from taxable income, partly on the
grounds that much of the gains are "phantom" income, an illusion of
inflation. President Bush is the most visible champion. In his 1988
campaign, relief for capital gains was nearly the only specific plank
in the domestic platform. As President he has focused intensely on it
for nearly two years, to the point of jeopardizing his relations with
Congress. With troops in the Persian Gulf he still accepted a risk of
having no budget, and shutting down domestic government to win the
issue. Nearly two years of prior negotiations had stalled on this one
matter.</p>
<p>The President is not doing this alone. In October 1990 he
announced a willingness to bend on capital gains, only to be reversed
by his supporters and forced into a politically dangerous acceptance
of higher tax rates, to win a small concession for capital gains. He
and his supporters carried it so far as to risk serious electoral
losses in November, 1990. This is a concerted, sustained drive by
intensely focused people willing to take heavy losses to win the one
point. The token preference they finally won this year is of value
mainly to differentiate gains from ordinary income, to prepare the
way for later efforts. They have shown staying power; so has the
other side. The contest is as old as income taxation, and is to be
perennial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The issues are distributive, allocative, and macroeconomic.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The distributive issue is clear, as issues go, and (for most
people)
argues against excluding gains from tax. There is little substantial
dispute that the proximate benefits of lowering the rate on gains
would be highly concentrated. The dispute focuses on subsequent
macroeconomic effects: supply-side kick, and demand-side
stimulus.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;The allocative issue is not much stressed. A tax on
realized
gains has some "locked-in effect." If the issue were pushed, the
answer would be that the locked-in effect results mainly from step-up
at death, rather than from a high rate per se.</li>
  <li>&nbsp;The macro issues are capital formation, and raising
investment. The case for lowering gains taxes is made mainly in those
terms, and we will treat it likewise. This case is a major expression
of what its champions call "supply-side economics," coupled with
traditional demand-side stimulus from investment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Spokesman Paul Craig Roberts writes the tax on capital gains
is simply "pandering to envy," and will abort capital formation at
the expense of the general welfare. The Marxist historian Maurice
Dobb, with a different emphasis, has also attributed capital
accumulation to fortunes made by holding land for the rise. [ <i>Maurice
Dobb, 1947, Studies in the Development of Capitalism, New York:
International Publishers, at pp. 179 ff.</i>]</p>
<p>We surely agree with Roberts et al. that domestic capital
formation is a crying current need; and the means is to foster saving
and investing (but properly defined, as below). We also agree there
is a strong, bi-partisan case for raising investment flows of the
income-creating, work-activating kind. Here,&#127; however, we meet the
problem of distinguishing new capital from old assets, especially
land.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land is not formed, like capital,
by saving and investment;
land is not reproducible. For that very reason land tends to
appreciate, and therefore has to be a major source of what are
misleadingly called "capital" gains.</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Again for that
very reason,
there is no supply-side kick in untaxing gains. Most of them are land
gains, and should be called that.</span> To use land as a store of
value is
macro-economically unproductive at best, and on balance
counterproductive and destabilizing (considering its effect on
financial institutions like the S&amp;Ls).</p>
<p>To handle this matter we need two semantic distinctions
which often are lost in the word-fencing of debate. Walter Heller,
whose policies still enjoy bi-partisan support, thought and spoke in
a Keynesian framework where "investment" means "investing," an
affirmative, job-making action. It is a process, not a store of
value; an economic flow, not a fund. It is not the asset held: this
"investment" is a noun, macro-economically static and sterile. [<i>Land
may appreciate, and one may call this "investment," but the
appreciation employs no one and creates no new wealth (although it may
reflect the externalities of wealth created by others).</i>]</p>
<p>To
signalize these differences I use the present participle "investing,"
rather than the ambiguous noun "investment."&nbsp;<b> </b><i
 style="font-style: italic;">[Webster's 9th New Collegiate defines
investment both ways: it is an action, (the Keynesian usage); it is
also an asset being held, a store of value. Such a two-faced word is a
natural medium for double-talk, and has been so exploited, to the
detriment of general understanding.</i><span style="font-style: italic;">]</span><b>
</b></p>
<p>Every Keynesian also knew in 1961 that investment means net,
positive-sum investing. It does not include buying and selling
existing assets like land: these are zero-sum transactions,
macro-economically non-functional and barren. [Keynes, although
careless of consistency, generally took care to distinguish old and new
assets. " ... the competition of a high interest-rate on mortgages may
well have had the same effect in retarding the growth of wealth from
current investment in newly produced capital-assets as high interest
rates on long-term debts ... " <small>[<i>General Theory, 1936, p.
241.] The old macro-economists generally refer to investing in newly
produced assets as "income- creating expenditure," which is clear and
correct, but too much of a mouthful.</i>]</small></p>
<p>I use "investing" only
in the sense of net, income-creating, job-making spending.<small> [<i>Note
the difference between real turnover and mere ownership turnover.
Ownership turnover generates no income (except for brokers and M&amp;A
personnel) and creates no capital. Real turnover also creates no
capital, but does forward supplies of goods to consume, and flows of
investing to produce replacement goods. Most of gross investing is
reinvesting funds received or anticipated from sales of old capital
(including inventories, which turn fast, and "fixed" capital which
turns slowly as it depreciates and the funds are reinvested).</i>]</small><b>
</b></p>
<p>As to
borrowing on land, that can be worse than barren when the financial
system rises and falls on a land bubble, as it has and is.</p>
<p>Heller and his contemporaries also knew that the incentive
driving job-making investing is <span style="font-weight: bold;">MRORAT,
the Marginal Rate of Return
after Taxes. </span><small>[<i>Economists of the 1960s, following
Keynes, called it the MEC, or "Marginal Efficiency of Capital," an
awkward phrase now little used. Awkward or not, and intended or not, it
had great historical consequence by putting the emphasis where it
belongs, on marginal rates of return, excluding rents.</i>]</small></p>
<p>The marginal idea is pivotal. The Average ROR includes
rents; the Marginal ROR is the pure return to new investment, Keynes'
"inducement to invest," which is activating and functional.</p>
<p>These Heller ideas were invoked again by supply-siders in
early Reagan times. However, policy over the course of the 80s lost
the substance of that policy, keeping only the guise. Domestic
leaders forgot the usage of "investment" in macro-economics. <br>
</p>
<p>They
gradually slipped into an illusion that buying and holding and
bidding up old assets like non-reproduceable lands and stocks would
make jobs and produce goods. They forgot to distinguish old from new
assets, and marginal from average returns on investment (average
returns, recall, include rents). Both critics and supporters of
"supply-side" policies now darken counsel by debating current
policies in supply-side terms, when the terms no longer describe the
policy at issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Along with normal confusion, there is intelligence behind
such error. The case for downtaxing gains depends in part on
exploiting confusion, in order to pass off rent-raising as an
incentive for saving and investing, and so to disguise its
non-functionality and eminent taxability. The policy is called
"supply side," but isn't. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The litmus test of the sincerity of capital-formation champions is
their treatment of irreproduceable land. Raising rents and land
prices, and protecting the gains from taxation, is purely
distributive, with no power to foster saving and investing. On the
contrary, a higher share for rent and/or land purchase must mean a
lower share for the investor in new capital.</p>
<p>Ignoring land and its distinctive attributes has the effect
of treating land as though it were true, reproduceable capital, to be
formed by saving and investing, to be routinely worn out and replaced
in the normal course of life and business. It lets advocates of
investing and capital formation abuse the legitimate case for macro
incentives, exploiting the case to camouflage unearned, nonfunctional
rents and increments to land value.[<i>Brookings' major contribution to
our subject is Henry Aaron (ed), 1976, Inflation and the Income Tax,
with chapters by 15 eminent economists. Land is treated by none and is
not in the index. [It is mentioned in passing only by one, George Lent.]</i>]</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tantamount to ignoring land is
minimizing its weight. </span>Thus
one may acknowledge it indulgently, while actually dismissing it. In
fact, though, land comprises some half the assessed value of taxable
real estate in California, and is not dismissable. Half the assessed
value means more than half the market value because of assessment
discrimination favoring land. A raft of studies of assessment
discrimination, like the sales/assessment ratio studies of the U.S.
Census, show consistent patterns of discrimination favoring land. In
addition to ordinary assessment discrimination there is much
legislated underassessment, for land in forest, farm, country club,
and other favored uses.</p>
<p>[An interesting recent case involves Charles H. Keating, Jr. of
Arizona. He and Kemper Marley posed as farmers to secure "millions of
dollars in agricultural tax breaks on land they planned to develop."
The breaks result from lower assessed land values for "farmers." [<i>Steve
Yozwiak, "Land-tax bill OK reached," The Arizona Republic, 13 April 89.</i>]</p>
Most states legislate similar loopholes, widely used by suburban land
speculators. More generally, the effect in California of Prop. 13 is to
keep much land assessed not much above its 1978 valuation.] If that
data were not enough, <span style="font-weight: bold;">most of us
resident in California have been through one or more years since 1976
when the value of our homes alone rose by more than our annual salaries.</span>
[<i>As early as 1970 it was possible to document a high share of land
value in national wealth: Mason Gaffney, 1970, "Adequacy of land as a
Tax Base," in Daniel Holland (ed.), The Assessment of Land Value,
Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, pp. 157-212. The theme is
further developed in the writer's "Why Research Farmland Ownership and
Values?", 1985, in T.A. Majchrowitz and R.R. Almy (eds.) Property Tax
Assessment, Chicago: U.S.D.A., I.A.A.O, and The Farm Foundation, pp.
91-109.</i>]
<p>Considering the true nature of most "capital" gains, it is
not surprising that economists have not come forward with claims of
large macro benefits from untaxing gains. The CBO, using a Washington
University Model, recently estimated that excluding 30% of gains from
the income tax base would raise GNP by only "0.1%" - a number well
below the accuracy of any macro model, and effectively zero. James
Poterba last year came up with another figure near zero. <small>[<i>Reported
in Business Week, 24 April 89, p.20. [My copy of Poterba's monograph
has apparently self- destructed.]</i>]</small></p>
<p>Poterba stresses the effect of portfolio substitution. So
does John Muellbauer of Nuffield College, Oxford. <small>[<i>John
Muellbauer, 1990, "The Great British Housing Disaster," ROOF, London:
Shelter, May/June.</i>]</small><b> </b></p>
<p>Land value, like
slaves and government bonds, meets the security need of asset-holders
without their having actually to create capital. High land
values doubly check saving.</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, by rising they look like individual income and encourage
more drafts on the flow of consumer goods, without adding to supply. </li>
  <li>Second, once risen, they satisfy portfolio demands in lieu of
real capital. </li>
</ul>
<p>British policy-makers take some heed of such wealth effects but,
according to Muellbauer, look only at paper assets and err by
overlooking land values.</p>
<p>Regardless of the several points above, many economists are
bent on relieving capital gains from taxation. Faced with mighty
political forces in collision, mainline economists have brought forth
a compromise technical fix: indexing capital gains. Alan&#127; Blinder, a
moderate and intelligent conservative, is a prominent spokesman. The
late Joseph Pechman, a moderate and intelligent liberal who long
championed taxing capital gains, wrote last year that "economists
agree" that indexing is the way to go. When the dean of Haig-Simons
boosters concedes so much, indexing would indeed seem to be the
consensus position. At times Congress and the President have been
close to seizing on indexing as a viable compromise, and may finally
do so one day.</p>
<p>The idea is to step up the basis of capital assets by the
same percentage as the price index rose over the period of ownership,
before deducting the basis from sale price to determine taxable gain.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic;">
</span><span style="font-style: italic;">[</span><i
 style="font-style: italic;">There has been little discussion of what
index to use, and it is not our topic. It is a major problem for
indexers.</i><span style="font-style: italic;">]</span></small><b> </b>The
purpose of this indexing is, of course, to remove "phantom
income" from the tax base.</p>
<p>Why remove phantom income from capital gains, and not from
other property income? William Vickrey often points out that all
assets, not just capital assets, are "taxed" by inflation. Inflation
with an income tax is in effect a general wealth tax. Monetary assets
are surtaxed in the obvious way, and equity assets (both capital and
ordinary) are surtaxed when they or their products are sold, because
of the phantom income they generate. Thus, if one favors a general
wealth tax (many people do) taxing phantom income is a way to achieve
a desired goal. <small>[N.B In today's atmosphere we forget how
recently it was learned, respectable and progressive to favor taxing
property, especially rents and unearned increments to land value.</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;After World War II a whole generation of development
economists toured the Third World promoting forms of property
taxation. One result was the Punta del Este Charter. Its ancillary
Santiago Conference on Fiscal Policy of December, 1962, sponsored by
OAS, IADB, and ECLA, pushed for no less than five kinds of high taxes
on property: on gains, on net wealth, on urban and rural property,
surtaxes on property income, and inheritance taxes. <span
 style="font-style: italic;">["Tax Reform
is Major Objective of Alliance in Latin America," International
Commerce, 4 Nov 63, pp.14 ff.]</span></small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;International agencies were pushing land reform and
property
taxation around the whole Third World. The east coast of Asia
responded, especially the "four tigers" of Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Singapore and Korea. If the policies have tended to suppress
enterprise and capitalism one is hard put to explain the
extraordinary capitalist development of the four tigers which tax
property heavily, and the stagnation of Latin America which does
not.</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;Lloyd George, when Chancellor of the Exchequer under
Herbert
Asquith in 1909, proposed a huge peacetime budget increase "to wage
war against poverty." (He was also financing a naval race.) He
included not just a small national land tax, but a tax on land gains,
and a surtax on income from land.</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson presided over
the
birth of the American income tax. Wilson's second Congress, elected
in 1914, contained the craftsmen. The first substantial application
of the 16th Amendment was in 1916, the law being designed by
Congressman Warren Worth Bailey. Bailey shaped the law to meet the
demands of the time for, and his personal belief in, special taxation
of unearned incomes. He was a leading "single-taxer" as they were
then miscalled, a champion of taxing unearned increments. The idea
was merged into Progressivism.</small></p>
<p><small>&nbsp;The Wilson administration Treasury even moved to tax
gains
as they accrue, a principle later endorsed by most tax economists
following Professors Haig and Simons and others. The USSC, however,
ruled that Congress must authorize such taxation explicitly (Eisner
v. Macomber, 1920). Congress, by that time heavily changed following
the Palmer raids and deportations delirium of 1920, declined. With
the end of the Cold War (which dates back to then, in its influence
on domestic ideology and policy), may we not now expect a revival of
Progressivism? END OF NOTE 13]</small></p>
<p>We are not pushing for a general wealth tax, but for
impartiality and accurate thinking about indexing capital gains, a
policy that would protect some forms of wealth, but not others. This
apparently temperate, common-sense proposal is in fact partial and
discriminatory. Worse, it protects most where the macro&#127; social
benefits are least.</p>
<p>Holders of monetary assets and recipients of fixed incomes
are the primary victims of inflation. Holders of depreciable capital
pay the inflation tax on phantom income that arises constantly in
ordinary use because depreciation write-off is limited to historical
cost. <small><span style="font-style: italic;">[It is useful to think
of "fixed" depreciable capital like
an onion with concentric layers. With time and/or use, layers are
sequentially peeled off and sold to consumers, like parts of an
inventory. With inflation, each peeling is sold for more than its
original nominal cost, yielding phantom taxable income. Actual
inventories may be sheltered by LIFO accounting; fixed capital is
not.]</span></small></p>
<p>In contrast, ordinary cash flow to landholders contains no
phantom income because there is no depreciation. Land is only taxed
on phantom gains at the time of sale, if ever. Since taxable
ownership turnover is very slow, about 2-3% per year, land is the
asset whose gains are already most sheltered by step- up of tax basis
at time of death and devise. Land is most sheltered by deferral of
tax until realization. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Indexing would simply give more shelter where shelter already is.</p>
<p>Land would be the asset most favored by the indexing of capital
gains
under tax law. Land's basis (the value to be augmented by indexing)
is not depreciated away (except illegally); and it is the asset most
likely to appreciate with and also without general inflation.</p>
<p>Equities gain when inflation lowers the real value of debt.
Indexing would then additionally help the equity owners, who have
already gained from inflation, not the creditors who have already
lost. Most private debt today is secured by real estate, either
directly or through the corporate veil. These landowner-debtors who
gain from inflation are largely the same ones whom it is proposed to
aid further by indexing their gains.</p>
<p>An invisible creditor that loses is the United States
Treasury. Most land carries deferred tax liabilities to be recouped
at time of sale. These liabilities include deductions taken by
expensing carrying costs on appreciating land.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic;"> [Such deductions
are "ordinary," and do not lower the basis of property.]</span></small>
Much of
the recoupment is illusory, when these invisible debts are paid in
depreciated dollars. This is phantom recoupment: the standard
literature neglects it completely. Phantom recoupment for The
Treasury is real untaxed income for landowners. The literature is
devoted to deploring taxes on phantom income. The results are
unbalanced thinking and misleading conclusions.</p>
<p>There are more invisible debts to The Treasury. Under the
Haig-Simons rationale these also include taxes that should have been
collected in the past, annually, as land price rose. When unpaid
taxes are accrued in good dollars, but paid later in bad, the
recoupment of tax liabilities is only partial. Accrued unpaid tax
liabilities are the Treasury's basis in appreciating lands: it has
bought into them by deferring taxes. To index the owner's basis but
not the Treasury's basis would cheat the Treasury, i.e. other
taxpayers. They are cheated anyway, since The Treasury does not
charge interest on the deferred taxes. They are cheated again because
the top marginal tax rate of 28% is now far below the 50% rate at
which most past deductions were taken.</p>
<p>Although most benefits of indexing go to land, the true
capital in owner-occupied residences, and personal playgrounds, would
also gain from indexing because the basis (the deductible value to be
stepped up by indexing) is not tax-depreciable and so remains fully
intact at time of sale. Thus, indexing would add to the heavy
existing tax bias for true capital in this particular form. Interest
and property taxes are fully expensible even though the counterpart
"imputed income" (benefit of occupancy) is untaxed.</p>
<p>In summary, selective lightening of taxes on new investment
can be justified on incentive grounds, but indexing "capital"
heltered, notably land. The ordinary cash flow from depreciable
capital, which needs better treatment, would not get it. The ordinary
cash flow from land contains no phantom income; landowners already
benefit from phantom recoupment of early deductions and deferrals;
debtor-landowners gain peculiarly from drops in the real value of
debt. Indexing would least relieve those most needing relief, and
vice versa.</p>
<p>Ominously, selective indexing of gains would also create a
powerful new pro-inflation lobby. It would further enrich lobby
supporters with more discretionary funds, and give them an urgent
interest adverse to the general welfare.</p>

<p>&nbsp;PS. I see that Dole and Kemp have switched their campaign
emphasis to the proposal to index capital gains for income tax
purposes. If your clients want a Georgist position on this subject,
you might want to have the attached article in your repertoire. It
is, to the best of my knowledge, also the only article on the subject
published in the Nat. Tax J. for the last several years. - Mase</p>
