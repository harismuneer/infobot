<p>Kelly Dunbar had a terrific conversation with Andrea Arden on Animal Cafe this week but before I get to the substance, I need to get a little gush &#8212; and one small whine &#8212; out of the way. I&#8217;ve seen Andrea on various Animal Planet shows and I&#8217;m a huge fan. I was trying to figure out what I like so much about her TV persona, and when I was looking for images to put on this post I figured it out: Dogs are always kissing her!</p>
<p>You never see dogs kissing Cesar Milan, of course, and &#8212; I could be wrong &#8212; but I don&#8217;t recall Victoria Stilwell getting bussed by any pups. A trainer who has no problem with overt signs of affection, who emphasizes the joy rather than the obedience aspect of the human-dog interaction, is my kind of TV role model.</p>
<p>The whine? I loved Andrea&#8217;s turn in from <a title="Underdog to Wonderdog" href="http://animal.discovery.com/tv/underdog-to-wonderdog/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://animal.discovery.com']);" target="_blank">Underdog to Wonderdog</a>, which showed that any dog could be a star with time and attention (and okay, a team of trainers, groomers, vets and dog house architects). I know it&#8217;s a fantasy, but I&#8217;ll take it over ones like, say, Kim Kardashian&#8217;s wedding. I wish Animal Planet would resurrect the show.</p>
<p>It would be remiss of me not to mention here that Andrea also has a thriving <a title="Andrea Arden dog training" href="http://www.andreaarden.com/dog-training/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.andreaarden.com']);" target="_blank">dog training business,</a> and is the author of several training books, including the recent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0764164333/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=wimydohame-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373&amp;creativeASIN=0764164333" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.amazon.com']);">Barron&#8217;s Dog Training Bible</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=wimydohame-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0764164333&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399373" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" />. So she actually <em>is</em> a dog trainer; she doesn&#8217;t just play one on TV.</p>
<h3>Great Expectations</h3>
<p>One of the biggest problems Andrea encounters as a trainer is people suffering from the Lassie Syndrome: expecting a dog to walk into their household and not only know exactly how to behave but also to perform supercanine feats. This sets a dog up to fail. <a href="http://willmydoghateme.com/dog-training-behavior/andrea-arden-talks-dog-training-people-training#more-13782"  class="more-link">Read More <span class="meta-nav">&raquo;</span></a></p>

<p><a href="http://willmydoghateme.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/example_vizsla.jpg" ><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-13327" title="example_vizsla" src="http://willmydoghateme.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/example_vizsla.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="225" /></a>I like to think I&#8217;m sensitive to the nuances of language. I spent a great deal of time in graduate school doing close readings of literary texts, especially poetry, and as a writer I struggle for precision, laboring over every sentence, sometimes every word.</p>
<p>I also know that good dog training is based on communication.</p>
<p>Yet until I listened to Kelly Dunbar&#8217;s interview for Animal Cafe with Roger Abrantes, who has a Ph.D. in evolutionary biology, it never occurred to me that a common training term conveys something that is antithetical to communicating with your dog &#8212; unless you wish to communicate that you are a dictator.</p>
<p>That term is <strong>command.</strong></p>
<p>Most of us use the word all the time without considering its implications. As Dr. Abrantes writes on his blog in a piece called <a title="Commands or Signals, Corrections or Punishers" href="http://rogerabrantes.wordpress.com/2011/10/03/commands-or-signals-corrections-or-punishers-praise-or-reinforcers/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://rogerabrantes.wordpress.com']);" target="_blank">Commands or Signals, Corrections or Punishers, Praise or Reinforcers</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;The majority of “positive” dog trainers have no problems using the word <strong><em>command</em></strong> and yet a command means “an authoritative direction or instruction to do something.” &#8230;.  The word has connotations of the military, the police and of authority in general&#8230; It beats me why we ban the terms <strong><em>dominance</em></strong> (without defining it properly) and <strong><em>punisher</em> </strong>(whilst disregarding the correct, technical definition of the term) and use <strong><em>command</em></strong> with no concern whatsoever.</p></blockquote>
<p>In her interview, Kelly calls her realization that the term <em>signal</em> could be used instead of <em>command</em> a light bulb moment. I felt like hitting my hand on the forehead and saying &#8220;D&#8217;oh.&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Abrantes, who speaks seven languages,  has written 17 books and loves dictionaries and definitions, realized that the word signal was more &#8220;neutral and benevolent&#8221; than command as early as 1994.  But the discovery &#8220;was in one of those impossible languages,&#8221; Dr. Abrantes tells Kelly in his humorous, self-deprecating way.</p>
<p>Besides, people only hear what they want to hear, what they are accustomed to. One anecdote I particularly liked in the interview was related to a seminar that Dr. Abrantes gave. He used the term signal consistently during his talk, yet all the questions that were addressed to him referred to commands<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Going hand in hand &#8212; or perhaps I should say whip in hand &#8212; with the term command is the term <em>obey</em>. Those who do not follow commands are, by implication, disobedient, and therefore deserving of punishment. Commanding is very different from signaling your dog to produce a behavior you desire. In the latter case, if the communication is unsuccessful, it&#8217;s not your dog&#8217;s fault but yours.</p>
<p>As it happens, Dr. Abrantes is often in a situation where the term command is appropriate: He works with police officers and detection dogs. But the commands are used between humans, not humans and canines, and they are justified by being applied in a situation requiring precision  &#8212; and by the fact that the need for them is recognized by all parties and that they are based on clear signals that all agree upon.</p>
<p>&#8220;I cannot obey a command I don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; Dr. Abrantes says. This is very different than our private lives, where &#8220;we don&#8217;t want a military relationship with our dogs.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s much more. To learn about the fallacy of thinking we can &#8220;lead&#8221; dogs &#8212; as Dr. Abrantes observes, dogs are far better than we are at solving canine problems &#8212; and to find out the connection between serving too much mayonnaise and successful dog training, listen to <a title="Dog Training Cues Commands Animal Cafe Roger Abrantes" href="http://www.animalcafe.co/dog-training-cues-signals-commands-and-how-they-affect-your-relationship-with-your-dog/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.animalcafe.co']);" target="_blank">the interview</a>. It&#8217;s one of the most interesting &#8212; and illuminating &#8212; conversations I&#8217;ve heard in a long time.</p>

<p title="Karen Pryor Academy Training, First-Hand: Part 1"><a title="Karen Pryor Academy Training, First-Hand: Part 1" href="http://willmydoghateme.com/dog-training-behavior/karen-pryor-academy-training-first-hand-part-1"  target="_blank">Last week</a> I explored the question of  why the talented Deborah Flick decided to take a break from her blog, <a title="Boulder dog" href="http://www.boulderdog.net" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.boulderdog.net']);" target="_blank">Boulder Dog, </a> to attend classes<a title="Karen Pryor Academy Training, First-Hand: Part 1"> at the Karen Pryor Training Academy</a>. This week I get into the nitty gritty details of the experience, and find out what Deborah &#8212; and Sadie &#8212; took away from it.</p>
<p><strong>Where were classes held and how was the course organized?</strong></p>
<p>Classes were at the <a title="Humane Society of Boulder Valley" href="http://www.boulderhumane.org/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.boulderhumane.org']);" target="_blank">Humane Society of Boulder Valley</a> in Boulder, CO.</p>
<p>The course ran for about four months and was divided into as many “units.” There was on-line work that included reading, taking quizzes, and writing assignments plus dog training exercises that I practiced with Sadie, all of which is quite time intensive. I think I devoted, on average, 10-20 hours a week depending on the written assignments, the training exercises, and how compulsive I was feeling.</p>
<p>Each of the four units culminated in a two-day on-site workshop in which all the students (8 in my class) and their dogs work together with the KPA instructor. Our instructor was Nan Arthur. She lives in San Diego and traveled to Boulder for the class sessions. In addition to reviewing all of our written assignments, she provided feedback regarding how well our dogs and we performed during the on-site class.</p>
<p>During the last on-site class in September we were evaluated on how well we performed in a ‘final’ training assessment with our dogs, and how well we did in teaching a mock dog training class in which our classmates and their dogs were the ‘learners.’</p>
<p><strong>Can you describe a typical day in the program?</strong></p>
<p>We’d begin the on-site classes with a welcome and warm-up. Everyone would be sitting around the HSBV training room with their dogs in crates, ex-pens, or tethered to the wall. We’d share how the previous month of training exercises went and do a little Q and A. Then we’d have “show-and-tell” during which we each would demonstrate for the class one of the training exercises we had worked on, for example, loose-leash walking with distractions.</p>
<p>Then we’d have some more discussion or a class activity during which we worked in pairs helping each other to teach our dogs a new behavior using one of the training techniques we had learned during the previous month. For example, I taught Sadie to turn her head and place her cheek solidly in my open hand. That was very sweet.</p>
<p>During the afternoon of the second day of the on-site classes, we’d have assessments. Usually we were given a new behavior to train and demonstrate. For example, for the first class I did a free-shaping exercise with Sadie where I shaped her to push a soccer cone with her nose back and forth across goals lines that were about three feet apart, and put that behavior on cue. That was fun!</p>
<p><strong>How did Sadie like it?</strong></p>
<p>There are two parts to this question. One is how did Sadie like learning? The other is, how did Sadie like being in the class for two days in a row?</p>
<p>Lucky for me, Sadie loved learning new behaviors. She was, and is, an enthusiastic learner. Often when I wanted to take a break, she’d look at me like I was out of my mind. The few times I did her bidding and continue on, we’d start to lose it. I’d mess up the sequence of cues, or click and treat for the wrong behavior. Sadie would sometimes offer a behavior other than the one I cued even though the cued behavior was one she had been reinforced for many times before. For example, I’d say “tad da,” her cue for a play bow, and Sadie would sit, which is her default behavior.</p>
<p>I learned the hard way that short training sessions are best. And, by short, I mean one minute or so, not much more.</p>
<p>As for being in classroom, I think that was a mixed bag for Sadie. When it was our turn to demonstrate for the class what we had learned, Sadie seemed to love performing in the middle of the room all bright and wiggly. But, she did not relish going back to her ex-pen despite my making her space as cushy and comfortable as possible with lots of chew toys and stuffed kongs. Sadie was exhausted by the end of the two-day, on-site classes. So was I.</p>
<p><strong>What were your biggest challenges?</strong></p>
<p>Pacing our training, as I mention above. Also, there’s a lot of mythos surrounding KPA classes. The amount of work and pressure to get everything completed – writing assignments and training exercises – is legendary. Unfortunately, I went into the class on edge and worried that I’d be overwhelmed. You know what they say about self-fulfilling prophecies. It took a while for me to realize that I could handle the workload just fine. All I needed to do was pace myself and set priorities.</p>
<p><strong>What were your biggest rewards?</strong></p>
<p>I think the biggest reward was seeing Sadie blossom. As you know, Sadie has lots of fear and reactivity issues. During the first class, Nan Arthur, our teacher, gave Sadie and me a huge compliment. She said something to the effect that you wouldn’t know just by looking at her that Sadie was a fearful dog. Sadie appears normal&#8212;and that’s what the goal is in working with a fearful dog&#8212;to help them develop the coping skills so that they seem like an okay dog even though deep down they aren’t.</p>
<p>Of course, leaning new training skills and receiving great feedback from Nan and my classmates was very rewarding. But, it was Sadie’s growth in confidence and remembering her joyful performances in the classroom that make my heart swell.</p>

Deborah has blogged occasionally, but wrote back in June that she was going to be busy studying at the Karen Pryor Academy and would return to more regular blogging when she completed the course.</p>
<p>Being the impatient person I am, I didn’t want to wait to find out how the course went until she got around to sharing her experience. Besides, how did I know she was going to address all of my specific questions? So I just asked her what I wanted to know &#8212; it helps that she’s a friend &#8212; and she was nice enough to answer.</p>
<p><strong>EJ: I’m going to be honest: Karen Pryor is one of those names in the animal training world that I know but I’m not sure precisely why. Can you explain who Karen Pryor is and tell me something about her academy &#8212; when it was established, what its goals are?</strong></p>
<p>DF: I hadn’t heard of Karen Pryor either until about five years ago. Sadie was a very fearful puppy and I was freaking out. I called on Nana Will, the trainer who had helped me with my previous dog, Morgaine. I hadn’t seen Nana in over fifteen years and during that time she had ‘crossed over’ from compulsion to reward-based training. I have huge respect for Nana. She’s a brilliant trainer. So, when she told me to read Jean Donaldson, Ian Dunbar, Patricia McConnell, David Mech, and, of course, Karen Pryor’s classic book, <a title="Don't shoot the dog book" href="http://store.clickertraining.com/dontshootdog.html" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://store.clickertraining.com']);" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Don’t Shoot the Dog</span>,</a> I did. Nana also regaled me with stories about Bob and Marian Breland Bailey of  ‘chicken camp’ fame. Nana had studied with the Baileys for several years.</p>
<p>Karen Pryor’s approach to dog training is based on the innovative work of Keller Breland, Marian Breland and Bob Bailey. Its hallmarks are: 1) breaking complex behaviors down into simple, teachable component parts, 2) using a behavior marker, usually a clicker, and 3) positive reinforcement. Keller and Marian Breland worked with B.F. Skinner as graduate students in the 1930s and went on to form a business, Animal Behavior Associates, in the 1940s. They trained all sorts of animals to do all sorts of things for all sorts of clients from the US Navy to General Mills.</p>
<p>The Brelands also were teaching their new approach to animal training to marine mammal trainers at places such as Sea World and Busch Gardens, among others. Bob Bailey, previously the director of the Marine Mammal Program at Pt. Magu, California, went to work with the Brelands in 1965 and subsequently married Marian some years after Keller died.</p>
<p>By the 1990s, after Marian and Bob had ‘retired’ from animal training, they were enlisted by people in the dog training field, including Karen Pryor, to teach the <em>mechanics </em>of their training method to dog trainers using chickens. Since Marian’s death, Bob has continued to teach chicken camps for animals trainers from around the world. I attended his chicken camp in Sweden in May just weeks before starting my studies with KPA.</p>
<p>Karen Pryor Academy was founded by <a href="http://www.clickertraining.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.clickertraining.com']);"><strong>Karen Pryor Clickertraining</strong></a>, and launched nationally in 2007 with training centers in 9 states and Ottawa, Canada, with 13 locations across North America.</p>
<p>According to the KPA website: Karen Pryor Academy was borne of the many requests KPCT received from trainers who wanted help setting standards for good training practices and help making trainers more financially successful.</p>
<p><strong>What attracted you to the Karen Pryor Academy? </strong></p>
<p>First and foremost, I was interested in learning the finer points of reward-based training using a behavior marker or clicker. Second, I wanted an in-depth experience. Third, I didn’t want to travel long distances to attend a class. Fourth, I wanted to be in a ‘real’ class with other students. I didn’t want a remote, on-line course.</p>
<p>I considered several other dog-training programs, and I interviewed three KPA graduates about their experiences. I think what clinched it for me was that KPA came to Boulder.</p>
<p><strong>What were your goals in attending?</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to delve deeper into the theory and practice of positive reinforcement training, and I wanted to improve my skills. I wanted to feel more confident and accomplished as trainer. I wanted to learn a way of thinking through training conundrums. I wanted feedback.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Did she get it? Stay tuned for Part 2.</p>

<div class="tweetmeme_button" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;"><a class="tm_button" rel="&amp;style=normal&amp;b=2" href="http://willmydoghateme.com/dog-training-behavior/stress-free-dog-training-a-chat-with-the-original-batwoman" ></a></div>
<p><a href="http://willmydoghateme.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Batwoman_Earth_Two_1.jpg" ><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-12920" title="Batwoman_Earth_Two_1" src="http://willmydoghateme.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Batwoman_Earth_Two_1-260x300.jpg" alt="" width="260" height="300" /></a>This week&#8217;s Animal Cafe podcast is exciting for two reasons. It marks the debut as a team member of Kelly Gorham Dunbar, co-founder and executive editor of <a href="http://www.dogstardaily.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.dogstardaily.com']);" target="_blank">DogStarDaily </a>&#8211; the best dog training/behavior site on the planet &#8212; as well as a contributing editor at Dogtime.com. And her first guest is a rock star in her own right: Grisha Stewart, the creator of Behavior Adjustment Training, or BAT. She has a new book, <a title="Behavior Adjustment training book" href="http://ahimsadogtraining.com/store/proddetail.php?prod=MCH-0167" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://ahimsadogtraining.com']);" target="_blank">Behavior Adjustment Training, </a>hot off the presses, and a variety of DVDs available. She is also embarking on a world tour.</p>
<h3>A Quick Aside: I Mean No Disrespect</h3>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what it is about BAT but &#8212; as you&#8217;ll see in the posts on my blog that I&#8217;ll be linking to &#8212; I can&#8217;t resist superhero or actual bat imagery when discussing the topic. In my defense, I was calling Frankie &#8220;Batboy&#8221; long before I knew about the training protocol because he has ears that look like they would make him capable of echolocation. And I wrote a guidebook to Austin, which is <a title="Bat Conservation International" href="www.batcon.org/" target="_blank">Bat Conservation International </a>headquarters. Bats fascinate me.</p>
<h3>What&#8217;s BAT about?</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s a positive, dog-empowering technique that allows dogs to feel confident in their ability to negotiate the world. Dogs behave in certain ways &#8212; barking and lunging for example &#8212; because they are trying to control their situations. But as Grisha says, they&#8217;re trying to get control &#8220;Not in a world domination kind of way but in a &#8216;I&#8217;m in London and I&#8217;d like to learn to use the Underground kind of way.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sweeping the world, as Grisha explains, because &#8220;It works. It&#8217;s humane. And you can see results quickly and tangibly.&#8221;</p>
<h3>WMDHM&#8217;s BAT Series</h3>
<p>But there&#8217;s no point trying to go into more detail when I was fortunate enough to edit a series of posts on the protocol written by Irith Bloom of <a title="The Sophisticated Dog" href="http://www.thesophisticateddog.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.thesophisticateddog.com']);" target="_blank">The Sophisticated Dog</a> and approved by Grisha:<a title="Batboy begins" href="http://willmydoghateme.com/dog-training-behavior/training-tuesday-batboy-begins"  target="_blank"> Batboy Begins</a>; <a title="Training Tuesday:  Batboy Continues" href="http://willmydoghateme.com/dog-training-behavior/training-tuesday-batboy-continues"  target="_blank">Batboy Continues,</a> <a title="Training Tuesday: Batboy Forever" href="http://willmydoghateme.com/dog-training-behavior/training-tuesday-batboy-forever"  target="_blank">Batboy Forever</a> and <a title="Training Tuesday: BAT Calming Signals, Some Visuals" href="http://willmydoghateme.com/dog-training-behavior/training-tuesday-bat-calming-signals-some-visuals"  target="_blank"> BAT Calming Signals, Some Visuals,</a></p>
<p>And I had the pleasure of having Crystal Saling, a BAT advocate and trainer at <a title="The Delightful Dog" href="http://www.delightfuldog.biz/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.delightfuldog.biz']);" target="_blank">The Delightful Dog,</a> come over and work with me and Frankie using the techniques. One of the posts that describes our progress: <a title="Training Tuesday: A BAT Landmark" href="http://willmydoghateme.com/dog-training-behavior/training-tuesday-a-bat-landmark"  target="_blank">Training Tuesday: A BAT Landmark</a></p>
<h3>A Quick Bit of Networking</h3>
<p>Grisha is going to be in Sweden and Norway and is looking for &#8220;local&#8221; gigs: Leo &#8212; aka <a title="Kenzo the hovowart" href="http://kenzothehovawart.blogspot.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://kenzothehovawart.blogspot.com']);" target="_blank">Kenzo the Hovawart</a>: You might want to get in touch with her, because I know that you&#8217;ve used BAT successfully with Viva. The schedule is posted in the right hand column of Grisha&#8217;s <a title="Functional Rewards" href="http://functionalrewards.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://functionalrewards.com']);" target="_blank">Functional Rewards</a> site.</p>
<h3>The Interview</h3>
<p>The conversation between Kelly and Grisha is delightful, a casual chat between two women who know more about dogs and training than most of us can ever hope to know in a lifetime and who discuss it all with ease and joy. So be sure to go over to Animal Cafe and <a title="Animal Cafe BAT interview" href="http://www.animalcafe.co/dog-behavior-adjustment-training-for-fear-frustration-and-aggression/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.animalcafe.co']);" target="_blank">listen</a>!</p>

<p>Frankie has the cutest nose in the world, a little black button of a sniffer. I have a tough time keeping myself from touching it, much to his annoyance.</p>
<p>But I have to admit, I&#8217;ve never thought of it as particularly effective. He just doesn&#8217;t seem to use his nose as much as other dogs do. When we&#8217;re on the trail, he rarely tugs on his leash to try to sniff at anything.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true that he&#8217;s often aware of my putterings around the kitchen, and it&#8217;s not noise that rouses him from his slumber because we live on a busy street. It&#8217;s also true that, when we&#8217;re outside, he&#8217;s probably more concerned about keeping up with me, his protector, than about checking out his environment.</p>
<p>But what about his squeaky carrot, his favorite toy? He loves to toss it around at home yet often can&#8217;t seem to locate it by scent. That&#8217;s one of the many questions &#8212; most of them of more general interest &#8212; that I asked Kelly Dunbar, a Certified Nosework Instructor through the <a title="National Association of K-9 Scent Work" href="http://www.funnosework.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.funnosework.com']);" target="_blank">National Association of Canine Scent Work</a> during my <a title="Animal Cafe Nose Work interview" href="http://www.animalcafe.co/nosework-letting-your-dog-do-what-comes-naturally/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.animalcafe.co']);" target="_blank">Animal Cafe</a> interview with her about this new sport.</p>
<h3> What it is</h3>
<p><strong>K9 Nose Work</strong> was developed in southern California in 2006 by Jill Marie O’Brien and Ron Gaunt, certified trainers who had worked with dogs using their noses in a professional &#8212; and serious &#8212; capacity for police and detection work. Their awareness of how much their charges enjoyed their employment gave them the idea to extend it to a sport that pet dogs could also benefit from.</p>
<h3>What Makes it Frankie- and City- Friendly</h3>
<p>Unlike tracking, which has also become popular, K9 Nose Work doesn&#8217;t require your dog to put his nose to the ground in wide open fields. Instead, your dog learns to find certain designated scents by sniffing the air in a variety of locations, including boxes and vehicles.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s a one-on-one, handler-dog activity so shy guys like Frankie don&#8217;t have to interact with strange canines or humans.</p>
<p>At least in the long run. Initially, both team members need to be instructed in how to let go and allow the dog to literally follow his nose, forgetting most training techniques they&#8217;ve previously experienced.</p>
<h3>But What About Arizona?</h3>
<p>As you&#8217;ll hear from the following interview, Kelly assured me that Frankie could learn how to do this, that all he needed was a bit of motivation. I got very excited at the idea of giving my little guy more confidence, and even fantasized that I could become an instructor eventually (yes, I&#8217;m ready for another career). But then I discovered that there are no K9 Scent Work classes in Arizona, so I can&#8217;t even learn how to work with Frankie, much less teach anyone else to do it.</p>
<p>Bummer.</p>
<p>Listen to the interview to find out why I was so excited about this sport. And then find someone willing to come to Tucson (or Phoenix) so we can enjoy it too, y&#8217;hear?  Send along a picture of that little furry Frankie face if you need to.</p>

<p><a href="http://willmydoghateme.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ruckusandbuck.jpg" ><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-11875" title="ruckusandbuck" src="http://willmydoghateme.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ruckusandbuck-300x125.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="125" /></a>Frankie is fearful. This  apparently disturbs some people. Only this morning, a generally friendly guy (GFG) I often encounter on the trail expressed annoyance that Frankie stopped in his tracks when his (illegally for that area) off-leash dog passed us. &#8220;She didn&#8217;t even approach your dog,&#8221; GFG said, irritably. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s so afraid of.&#8221; GFG seemed to take it as a personal affront that Frankie didn&#8217;t automatically acknowledge his pup&#8217;s harmlessness.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s my well-intended regular dog-walking friend. He&#8217;s fond of Frankie but nevertheless feels compelled to apologize for his shyness when we stop to chat with other people.&#8221;He&#8217;s a rescue,&#8221; my friend often says, by way of explaining why Frankie isn&#8217;t as outgoing as his own gregarious fox terrier.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t even get me started on the &#8220;He must have been abused&#8221; comments I get.</p>
<p>But no one ever says, &#8220;He must not have been properly socialized.&#8221; Which is the likeliest source of Frankie&#8217;s shrinking violet tendencies.</p>
<p>I work to make him as comfortable as possible and the little guy has a pretty happy life. But I&#8217;m fairly certain that, if he had been taught to associate new situations, people and dogs with positive things at a very early age, he would be a lot more confident now.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Ariana Kincaid&#8217;s <a title="Operation Socialization" href="http://operationsocialization.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://operationsocialization.com']);" target="_blank">Operation Socialization</a> is so important. On this week&#8217;s Animal Cafe podcast, an interview with Kincaid by trainer Eric Goebelbecker &#8212; himself certified in the program &#8212; explains the latest thinking on this topic.</p>
<p>There are still many breeders and veterinarians who warn against socializing puppies too early for fear of disease. But, as Kincaid notes, behavioral problems that cause dogs to be given to shelters and, often, euthanized, are a lot more detrimental to their well- being than potential illnesses.</p>
<p>She  explains on her site:</p>
<blockquote><p>Taking advantage of your puppy&#8217;s early development is critical. This is when he&#8217;s at his most receptive; open and pliable. Make sure he has as many positive experiences out in the world during this time so he&#8217;ll grow up to be easygoing and friendly. If you wait, your puppy&#8217;s &#8220;internal timer,&#8221; the so-called socialization window, begins to close (around 12-16 weeks of age). After this, he&#8217;s genetically programmed to become more and more distrustful of new or unpleasant experiences.</p></blockquote>
<p>One fun aspect of Operation Socialization is that it provides a network of places where owners who take part in the program can get their &#8220;socialization passports&#8221; stamped, making the process into a kind of game &#8212; and making it easy to achieve goals. I remember reading socialization recommendations that involved inviting hat-wearing friends to ring your doorbell or getting people to pass a puppy around while eating pizza (the people, not the puppy). Maybe I have boring friends, but I thought at the time that I wouldn&#8217;t know enough people willing to do anything like that. A program like this makes it easy.</p>
<p>I have to admit, I can&#8217;t imagine getting a puppy.  The idea of adopting an older dog with a fully formed personality appeals to me far more. But, as much as I adore Frankie, next time I would hope that the dog&#8217;s personality might have been formed with the help of a great deal of socialization at an early age.</p>

<p>Pets don&#8217;t judge us. And play is an important way for children to communicate. Those two concepts help explain why Dr. Rise Van Fleet&#8217;s <a title="Playful pooch" href="http://www.playfulpooch.org/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.playfulpooch.org']);" target="_blank">Pet Play Therapy</a> program has proved so effective.</p>
<p>A licensed psychologist and                         registered play therapist supervisor, Van Fleet is also an approved evaluator with the American Kennel                         Club’s Canine Good Citizens Program and a full member of the Association of Pet Dog Trainers, so she can gauge both human and canine behavior.</p>
<h3>The premise</h3>
<p>In her interview with Eric Goebelbecker for Animal Cafe, Van Fleet explains, &#8220;Play therapy is a way of communicating with children. Kids  reveal a lot more about what&#8217;s going on in their minds through play than through talking. It&#8217;s safer for them emotionally.&#8221; <a href="http://willmydoghateme.com/dog-training-behavior/dog-assisted-therapy-its-childs-play#more-11302"  class="more-link">Read More <span class="meta-nav">&raquo;</span></a></p>

<h3>The premise</h3>
<p>The first paragraph read:</p>
<blockquote><p>When you come home to find Rover has mistaken the trash cans in the back yard for a snack bar and Sylvester has decided to use the back of your favorite upholstered chair as a claw sharpening tool, it’s tempting to feel less than friendly toward man’s best friends. Backyard romping is soon replaced by enclosed pens or tie-outs to keep pets away from trouble. Pet owners find themselves creating mazes of baby gates in the house to keep pets away from specific rooms. Soon, pet and owner alike no longer feel free to move around anymore.</p></blockquote>
<p>The solution?  Electrify your house with &#8220;a mobile wireless system to train pets to avoid areas of the home or yard where they might get in trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seriously? You&#8217;re supposed to create a series of shock zones in your home? Why not just lay down a few IEDs? That&#8217;ll really get the &#8220;don&#8217;t go there&#8221; message across. <a href="http://willmydoghateme.com/dog-training-behavior/shock-your-pet-at-home#more-11099"  class="more-link">Read More <span class="meta-nav">&raquo;</span></a></p>

<p><a href="http://willmydoghateme.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/TibbsFamily2.jpg" ><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-10894" title="TibbsFamily2" src="http://willmydoghateme.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/TibbsFamily2.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="223" /></a>If you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;ve often gotten these email pleas: &#8220;Friends of mine have to give up their dog because he&#8217;s growling at the new baby. Can you help them find him a new home?&#8221;</p>
<p>They usually go on to detail what a wonderful dog he is, and how heartbroken the family feels.</p>
<p>I always feel heartbroken too. What a way to welcome a new family member &#8212; by getting rid of another one. That&#8217;s got to create lots of guilt and self-recriminations during a period that&#8217;s already stressful. And the dog is labeled as &#8220;scary,&#8221; no matter what a great pet he had been, so the chances of finding him a new home go down significantly.</p>
<p>But now I know about Jen Shyrock, a certified dog behavior consultant with a degree in special education for elementary students. She created the <a title="Dogs and Storks" href="http://www.dogsandstorks.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.dogsandstorks.com']);" target="_blank">Dogs and Storks Program</a> to head off just those types of situations before they occur. She discusses this life-changing program as well as her new <a title="Dog and Baby Connection " href="http://www.thedabc.com/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.thedabc.com']);" target="_blank">Dog and Baby Connection </a>project with Eric Goebelbecker of <a title="Dog Spelled Forward" href="http://www.dogspelledforward.com" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.dogspelledforward.com']);" target="_blank">Dog Spelled Forward</a> in this week&#8217;s Animal Cafe.</p>
<h3>The Genesis of Dogs and Storks</h3>
<p>Shyrock is a mother of four  &#8212;  ages 15, 13, 10 and 21 months &#8212; whose household  includes a pit bull, a German Shepherd and a Siberian husky, not to  mention four cats. So she not only talks the talk but has walked the walk &#8212; one filled with stroller awkwardness and dog poop &#8212; when she discusses the difficulties involved in keeping dogs from having to be rehomed when a new baby arrives.</p>
<p>It was her work with German Shepherd rescue that made her realize something needed to be done. As Shyrock says in the interview, &#8220;I saw so many wonderful dogs being surrendered. I knew there had to be a way to keep them at home.&#8221;</p>
<p>Among the other great information in the FAQ section of the Dog and Storks website are <strong>five tips to prepare for the baby&#8217;s arrival</strong>, how to respond &#8220;when&#8221; the dog reacts to the baby, as she emphasizes, not &#8220;if&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Identify and decrease attention-seeking behaviors such as pawing, barking, or jumping.</p>
<p>2. Become familiar with the subtle signals and body language of dogs.</p>
<p>3. Begin a baby-friendly, flexible routine of feeding and activities – and include your dog! Be sure to take these opportunities to practice obedience skills.</p>
<p>4. Role-play with a doll &amp; baby equipment to help gradually expose your dog to these new and exciting items.  Reward calm and desired behavior.</p>
<p>5. Identify and begin to use designated “dog zone/s” such as a gated or closed room, outside, a kennel or crate, etc.  If you have multiple dogs get them used to being apart from one another, too.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Dog and Baby Connection</h3>
<p>Recently Shyrock began thinking about the fact that dogs are far more at risk for rehoming <em>after </em>the baby arrives than before. She says in the interview, &#8220;The hard part is when the little one gets moving, that&#8217;s when we run into the growling and biting.&#8221;</p>
<p>She came up with the idea of not only offering presentations to discuss these issues but also having licensed practitioners, many of whom already have their own dog training businesses, to provide on site analysis &#8212; the basis for the Dog and Baby Connection program. &#8220;It&#8217;s essential to get into the home to see the environment,&#8221; Shyrock says, in order to help people read their dogs&#8217; subtle body language and assess individual situations. Some dogs, for example, may enjoy being able to see the family interacting with the baby in an adjacent room, while other may find it distressing.</p>
<p>Shyrock also points out that many people ignore a dog&#8217;s shifting life stages. Thus parents who have experienced the family dog being great with a first baby don&#8217;t realize that not only is every baby different but that the dog is different too. &#8220;An older dog may be less patient,&#8221; Shyrock explains.</p>
<p>Above all, Shyrock knows how easy it is for mothers to feel overwhelmed and to fall prey to feelings of inadequacy. Even with all her knowledge and experience &#8212; in addition to everything else, she grew up in a family that showed dogs &#8211;  Shyrock too has gone through the &#8220;rehoming phase,&#8221; the one where she has felt that she can&#8217;t possibly pay adequate attention to her dogs&#8217; needs and they might be better cared for elsewhere.</p>
<p>Her suggestions for what to do? Well, listen to the<a title="Animal Cafe podcast Jen Shyrock" href="http://www.animalcafe.co/children-and-dogs-safety/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.animalcafe.co']);" target="_blank"> podcast.</a> Shyrock is extremely personable and articulate and, above all, dog-oriented. It&#8217;s refreshing to listen to someone so devoted to trying to keep families together &#8212; including the nonhuman members.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll want to come back to the <a title="Animal Cafe Chat Room" href="http://www.animalcafe.co/chat-cafe/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.animalcafe.co']);" target="_blank">Animal Cafe chatroom</a> on Wednesday, May 11, at 9PM EST to follow up with Shyrock, if only to thank her for creating these two great programs. Trust me. I don&#8217;t have any kids, but I&#8217;m grateful that she&#8217;s provided me with a positive way to respond to those depressing emails.</p>
