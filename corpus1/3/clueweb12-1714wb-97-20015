        <h3>1040 Tax Calculator (Tax Year 2012)</h3>
        <p>Enter your filing status, income, deductions and credits and we will estimate your total taxes for 2012.  Based on your projected withholdings for the year, we can also estimate your tax refund or amount you may owe the IRS next April 2013. In 2012, Federal income tax rates were scheduled to increase to pre-2001 levels, but the "Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010" left the existing tax brackets in place through 2012.  Please note that this calculator uses the preliminary 2011 tax tables.<p>

          <dt>2012 Tax rates:</dt>
          <dd>
            In 2012, Federal income tax rates were scheduled to increase to pre-2001 levels, but the "Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010" left the existing tax brackets in place through 2012.  The income ranges were increased modestly for inflation, but otherwise remained the same as 2010.  Below are the resulting tax rates and income ranges for 2012:

            <p>Choose your filing status. Your filing status determines the income levels for your federal tax bracket. It is also important for calculating your standard deduction, personal exemptions, and deduction phase out incomes.  The table below summarizes the five possible filing status choices.  It is important to understand that your marital status as of the last day of the year determines your filing status.</p>

          <dt>Dependents</dt>
          <dd>A dependent is someone you support and for whom you can claim a dependency exemption. In 2012, each dependent you claim entitles you to receive a $3,800 reduction in your taxable income (see exemptions below). You may also receive a tax credit of up to $1,000 for each dependent child under the age of 17. The credit is, however, phased out for at higher incomes.</dd>
          <dt>Total exemptions claimed</dt>
          <dd>Each exemption you claim reduces your taxable income by $3,800 for 2012. You receive an exemption for yourself, your spouse and one for each of your dependents.</dd>
          <dt>Capital gain or loss</dt>
          <dd>
            This is the total capital gain you realized from the sale of assets.  This calculator allows you to enter your total short-term capital gain for investments held less than one year and your total long-term gain for investments held at least one year.   Any amount you enter as a short-term capital gain is taxed as normal income.  Any amount you enter as a long-term capital gain is taxed as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>This calculator assumes that all of your long-term capital gains are taxed at either 0% or 15%.</li>
              <li>The tax is 0% for the portion of your gain that would have been taxed at 15% or lower tax if it were a short-term gain.</li>
              <li>The tax is 15% for any of your capital gain that would have been taxed at a rate higher than 15% if it were considered a short-term gain.</li>
              <li>This calculator assumes that none of your long-term capital gains come from collectibles, section 1202 gains or un-recaptured 1250 gains.  These types of capital gains are taxed at 28%, 28% and 25% respectively (unless your ordinary income tax bracket is a lower rate).</li>
            </ul>
            Capital gains were scheduled to increase in 2012, however the "Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010" left them at their existing rates shown above.
