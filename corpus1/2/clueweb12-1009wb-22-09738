                  <p>The U.S. Pacific Fleet has maintained and secured
                  America&#39;s presence in this vast and vital ocean area
                  for nearly two centuries, providing a stabilizing
                  influence or military force as conditions and the
                  nation&#39;s goal demand.</p>

                  <p>The U.S. Pacific Fleet&#39;s contributions to our
                  Navy&#39;s proud heritage date back to 1821, with the
                  establishment of the Pacific Squadron. This small force
                  confined its activities initially to protecting U.S.
                  commercial shipping in the waters off North and South
                  America and around Hawaii, then expanded its scope to
                  include the Western Pacific in 1835, when the East India
                  Squadron joined the force. The Pacific Squadron mounted
                  expeditions to Sumatra in the 1830s to protect American
                  merchant shipping and was instrumental in capturing what
                  is now California during the Mexican-American War of
                  1846-48.  The extent of its responsibility was further
                  enlarged in the 1850s when California and Oregon were
                  admitted to the Union.</p>

                  <p>The importance of U.S. Pacific naval forces as an
                  instrument of foreign policy blossomed in July 1853, when
                  Commodore Matthew C. Perry delivered a letter from
                  President Millard Fillmore seeking diplomatic and trade
                  relations between the United States and Japan. Less than
                  nine months later, in March 1854, Commodore Perry
                  negotiated and signed a treaty between the two countries,
                  opening Japan to trade with other nations for the first
                  time in 300 years.</p>

                  <p>Following the Civil War, the Pacific Squadron conducted
                  anti-piracy operations in the Gulf of California.  It was
                  during this period, the 1870s, when the Navy and Hawaii
                  became firmly intertwined. A warship of the Pacific Fleet
                  helped quell riots following the election of King David
                  Kalakaua in 1874, and the king later granted the United
                  States the rights to use Pearl Harbor as a coaling
                  station.</p>

                  <p>The Spanish-American War of 1898 resulted in further
                  expansion of American naval power in the Pacific.
                  Commodore George Dewey led America&#39;s Asiatic Squadron
                  into Manila Bay for the first engagement of the war, on
                  May 1, 1898. When the battle ended seven hours later,
                  eight Spanish warships had been destroyed.  Two months
                  later, off the coast of Cavite, Philippines, Commodore
                  Dewey issued the famous order, &quot;You may fire when
                  ready, Gridley,&quot; and dealt the final blow to the
                  remaining Spanish fleet. This decisive victory left the
                  United States in possession of former Spanish territory in
                  the Philippines and the Mariana Islands. More importantly,
                  it established the United States as a major maritime
                  power.</p>

                  <p>The Asiatic and Pacific squadrons remained separate
                  until April 15, 1907, when they were combined to form the
                  United States Pacific Fleet.  In 1922, the Pacific and
                  Atlantic fleets were combined to form the United States
                  Fleet, which positioned a main body of ships in the
                  Pacific and a scouting fleet in the Atlantic. For the
                  first time, the major weight of American seapower was
                  assigned to the Pacific.</p>

                  <p>The fragile peace during the years between the world
                  wars began to wither in the late 1930s with the emergence
                  of Germany and Japan as military threats. With the fall of
                  France and England standing alone, the possibility of
                  American involvement in the war saw the U.S. Navy again
                  split into two separate fleets.</p>

                  <p>The Pacific Fleet established its new headquarters at
                  Pearl Harbor on Feb. 1, 1941. Ten months later, on Dec.
                  7, Japanese warplanes attacked ships and installations at
                  Pearl Harbor and elsewhere on Oahu without warning,
                  thrusting America into World War II.</p>
                   
                  <p>The war in the Pacific raised to glory some of
                  history&#39;s finest naval commanders, legendary names
                  including Nimitz, Halsey and Spruance. Likewise,
                  America&#39;s most decisive blows toward total victory in
                  World War II were struck here, from the early triumphs at
                  Midway and the Solomon Islands to the climactic clashes of
                  the Philippine Sea and Okinawa. This turbulent chapter in
                  world history finally ended with the formal surrender of
                  the Japanese aboard USS Missouri (BB 63) on Sept. 2, 1945.
                  At the time, the U.S. Navy had 6,768 ships in service,
                  most of them in the Pacific.</p>

                  <p>Five years of peace following World War II came to an
                  end on June 26, 1950, when North Korean troops attacked
                  South Korea. The Pacific Fleet responded by providing air
                  strikes from offshore aircraft carriers and conducting the
                  amphibious assault at Inchon. Control of the seas once
                  again gave U.S. and other United Nations forces the
                  decisive advantage.  A cease-fire signed on July 27, 1953,
                  halted the fighting.</p>

                  <p>Following a decade of peaceful operations, the Pacific
                  Fleet was again called to war, this time in Southeast
                  Asia. By mid-1968 the Pacific Fleet was actively engaged
                  in the Vietnam conflict, with 225 ships committed to
                  operations in the South China Sea. In addition to
                  providing air support from aircraft carriers operating off
                  the coast, Pacific Fleet Sailors patrolled the Mekong
                  River in gunboats. The Vietnam cease-fire was signed on
                  Jan. 27, 1973.</p>

                  <p>In the post-Vietnam period, the Pacific Fleet increased
                  operations with allied navies, thereby ensuring freedom of
                  the seas for all nations.  Pacific Fleet responsibilities
                  expanded to include the Indian Ocean, where aircraft
                  carrier battle groups operate in support of vital U.S.
                  national interests in that volatile part of the world.</p>
                   
                  <p>On Aug. 4, 1990, Pacific Fleet Navy and Marine Corps
                  forces began deploying to the Persian Gulf and North
                  Arabian Sea in support of Operation Desert Shield. More
                  than 50 Pacific Fleet ships, including the USS
                  Independence (CV 62), USS Midway (CV 41), USS Ranger (CV
                  61) and USS Missouri (BB 63) battle groups and
                  approximately 20 amphibious ships were ultimately
                  deployed. The ships and personnel were initially used to
                  support economic sanctions set up against Iraq after it
                  invaded Kuwait. Operation Desert Storm began Jan. 16,
                  1991, the day after Iraq failed to meet the deadline to
                  leave Kuwait.</p>

                  <p>Ships of the USS Tarawa (LHA 1) Amphibious Ready Group
                  (ARG) demonstrated the flexibility of naval forces in May
                  1991. While returning from combat duty in the Persian
                  Gulf, the Tarawa ARG served as the centerpiece of
                  humanitarian relief operations in cyclone-devastated
                  Bangladesh. In the summer of 1991, Seventh Fleet ships
                  converged on the Philippines to evacuate U.S. military and
                  families after the eruption of Mount Pinatubo.</p>

                  <p>During Operation Restore Hope in 1992-93, USS Rushmore
                  (LSD 47) spearheaded a joint task force landing to provide
                  humanitarian aid to drought-stricken Somalia. Naval forces
                  also continued vital presence operations in the volatile
                  Persian Gulf region, supporting Operation Southern Watch,
                  which controlled and monitored airspace over Southern
                  Iraq.</p> 

                  <p>In December 1998, ships of the USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70)
                  Carrier Battle Group and Carrier Air Wing 11 participated
                  in Operation Desert Fox, striking key military targets in
                  Iraq with a combination of attack aircraft and cruise
                  missiles, launched from USS Antietam (CG 54), USS
                  Princeton (CG 59), USS Paul Hamilton (DDG 60) and other
                  Pacific Fleet ships.</p>

                  <p>Following the terrorist attacks on New York and
                  Washington, D.C., on Sept. 11, 2001, Pacific Fleet units
                  again answered the call. On Oct.  7, less than a month
                  after the attack, aircraft from USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70)
                  and surface ships conducted the first strikes on terrorist
                  strongholds in Afghanistan, launching Operation Enduring
                  Freedom. The following year, dozens of Pacific Fleet ships
                  served in the Arabian Sea, including USS Kitty Hawk (CV
                  63), USS Constellation (CV 64), USS John C. Stennis (CVN
                  74) and USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72).</p>
                   
                  <p>In January 2003, the Pacific Fleet deployed a
                  seven-ship Amphibious Task Force West, led by USS Boxer
                  (LHD 4) and USS Bonhomme Richard (LHD 6), to the U.S.
                  Central Command.  In February, the Pacific Fleet also
                  deployed the USS Kitty Hawk Battle Group there, to serve
                  alongside the USS Abraham Lincoln and USS Constellation
                  battle groups in Operation Iraqi Freedom.</p>

                  <p>More recently, the Pacific Fleet has taken a larger
                  role in providing humanitarian relief throughout the
                  region.  USS Abraham Lincoln helped victims of the Dec.
                  26, 2004, tsunami that devastated coastal areas from
                  Indonesia to Africa. That operation led the U.S. Pacific
                  Fleet to establish Pacific Partnership, an annual
                  humanitarian assistance initiative that provides medical,
                  dental, veterinary, engineering and agricultural civic
                  action programs throughout Southeast Asia and the South
                  Pacific to promote interoperability between host nations
                  and partner nations. Pacific Partnership promotes
                  sustainable improvements in the quality of life for the
                  citizens of host nations while improving the partner
                  nations&#39; collective ability to respond to a natural
                  disaster.</p>

                  <p>In 2006, USNS Mercy (T-AH 19) visited the Philippines,
                  Bangladesh, Indonesia and Timor-Leste (East Timor),
                  providing much-needed medical service to thousands of
                  people in those nations. In 2007, USS Peleliu (LHA 5)
                  deployed on a similar Pacific Partnership mission,
                  providing medical and dental services as well as
                  engineering work in the Philippines, Vietnam, the
                  Solomon Islands, the Marshall Islands and Papua New
                  Guinea. In 2008, as part of the Maritime Strategy, USNS
                  Mercy returned to Pacific Partnership for a
                  humanitarian/civic assistance mission to the Philippines,
                  Vietnam, the Federated States of Micronesia, Timor-Leste
                  and Papua New Guinea.</p>

                  <p>In 2009, USNS Richard E. Byrd (T-AKE 4) traveled for
                  the first time to Samoa, Tonga and Kiribati and returned
                  for a second visit to the Solomon Islands and the Republic
                  of the Marshall Islands, staying in each country for 10 to
                  14 days to deliver a variety of medical, dental,
                  veterinary, preventive health, engineering and community
                  relations programs.  In 2010, Pacific Partnership again
                  involved USNS Mercy, which visited Vietnam, Cambodia,
                  Indonesia and Timor-Leste. Visits by USS Blue Ridge (LCC
                  19) at Palau and HMAS Tobruk at Rabaul, Papua New
                  Guinea, were also part of Pacific Partnership 2010.</p>

                  <p>The amphibious transport dock ship USS Cleveland (LPD
                  7), served as the operation platform for the Pacific
                  Partnership 2011 mission, which included visits to Tonga,
                  Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste and the Federated
                  States of Micronesia.  Over the years, Pacific Partnership
                  missions have included personnel and units and civilian
                  volunteers from many other nations.</p>

                  <p>In March 2011, the Pacific Fleet led U.S. support for
                  Japan in the wake of the devastating 9.0 earthquake and
                  subsequent tsunami that destroyed much of the Tohoku
                  region.  The U.S.  military engaged in two dynamic
                  operations focused on assisting the government of Japan
                  and Japan Self Defense Forces: humanitarian assistance and
                  disaster response as part of Operation Tomodachi and
                  closely monitoring events related to the Fukushima nuclear
                  power plant in order to provide consequence management
                  assistance if requested.  More than 20,000 personnel, 140
                  aircraft, and 20 ships from the U.S.  military were
                  involved in Operation Tomodachi.</p>

                  <p>In May 2011, U.S.  Pacific Fleet&#39;s USS Carl Vinson
                  (CVN 70), completing a deployment in support of U.S.
                  Central Command, buried Osama bin Laden at sea after the
                  mastermind of the Sept.  11, 2001, terror attacks on
                  America was killed in a Navy SEAL raid.</p>

                  <p>Today the Pacific Fleet remains the world&#39;s largest
                  naval command, extending from the West Coast of the United
                  States, into the Indian Ocean, encompassing three oceans,
                  six continents, and more than half the Earth&#39;s
                  surface.</p>

                  <p>The approximately 180 ships and submarines, 1,500
                  aircraft, and 125,000 Sailors, Marines and civilians of
                  the Pacific Fleet continue to be a credibly led,
                  combat-ready and surge-ready Fleet prepared in peace,
                  crisis or war. The U.S. Pacific Fleet is a purposeful
                  presence, building trust and cooperation with our partners
                  to advance Asia-Pacific regional security and
                  prosperity.</p>
