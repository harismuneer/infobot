<p>Paper prepared for "Tax Reform in Canada: Our Path to Greater Prosperity"
Conference, to be held October 11, 2001, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.</p>



<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Businesses in Canada are taxed in a variety of ways.  The most important tax
on business is of course the corporate income tax (CIT), but a variety of other
taxes are levied on businesses.  The personal income tax (PIT) levied on
unincorporated businesses and the taxation of corporate dividends and business
capital gains under the PIT also affect business decisions.  Federal and
Provincial taxes on corporate capital represent another component of business
taxation.   Municipal and Provincial property taxes on commercial and
industrial property are also important.</p>

<p>The employer component of federal and provincial payroll taxes is the second
most important set of taxes paid by businesses.  In 1995 revenues from business
payroll taxes actually exceeded corporate income tax revenues.  In 2000 total
corporate revenues were almost $46 billion, whereas total business payroll
taxes were $28.6 billion.  Table 1 presents details on Corporate Income,
Capital and Payroll Taxes.</p>

<p>In this paper I shall focus on the corporate income tax and the related
issues of Personal/Corporate income tax integration.  For a discussion of the
effects of business payroll taxes, see Mintz and Wilson (2001) and Dungan
(1998).</p>

<p>In evaluating the corporate income tax and corporate/personal tax
integration, I assume that the basic structure of the income tax system remains
unchanged – i.e. no radical reforms such as a switch from an income base to a
consumption base are contemplated.  This means that I evaluate the corporate
income tax within an income-based tax system.</p>

<h3>Reasons for a Separate Corporate Income Tax</h3>

<p>Why tax corporate profits at all?  Since these profits are ultimately either
distributed as dividends or generate capital gains, both of which are taxed
under the personal income tax system, one could argue that a corporate income tax is redundant and involves an element of double taxation of corporate source income.</p>

<p>Whether there is in fact double taxation depends on the degree of
integration of the PIT and the CIT.  A fully integrated CIT will eliminate
double taxation.  I would argue that a separate (but integrated) corporate
income tax is required in an income tax system for several reasons.  First,
taxing corporate income at the corporate level protects the personal income tax
base.  If there were no corporate income tax, the absence of taxation of
undistributed profits would present extensive opportunities to defer personal
income taxes (since capital gains are taxed on a realization basis).  Corporate
level taxes mitigate or eliminate this problem.  Second, a corporate tax
enables Canada to tax profits of foreign owned enterprises.  Without a
corporate tax, profits of foreign owned enterprises would be fully taxed in the
source country.  A Canadian corporate tax enables Canada to tax these profits
first; eliminating this tax would effectively transfer most of the revenues to
foreign treasuries.</p>

<p>Finally, a separate corporate income tax effectively taxes pure profits or
'rents' on an accrual basis.   As noted by Boadway and Kitchen (1980) this
portion of the corporate tax would be non-distorting and hence highly
efficient.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup>1</sup></a></p>


<h3>Existing Corporate Income Taxes in Canada</h3>

<p>The federal and provincial governments in Canada tax corporate profits. 
Seven of the provinces levy their tax on the federal base (and have the federal
government collect tax on their behalf).  Three important provinces (Alberta,
Ontario, and Quebec) have separate corporate taxes.</p>

<p>Statutory and effective rates of tax vary by industry, by size, by type of
asset and by province.  Major features of the existing CIT system include:</p>

<p>A preferential rate for manufacturing.</p>

<p>Special allowances and deductions for certain resource industries.</p>

<p>A favourable rate for small Canadian controlled private companies (CCPCs). 
The corporate taxation of these companies is approximately fully integrated
with personal taxes.</p>

<p>Since dividends receive a credit (under a gross-up and credit mechanism) and
capital gains are taxed at ½ the rate of ordinary income, there is partial
integration of the CIT and PIT for large companies.</p>

<p>When compared with other countries, the current level of statutory corporate
tax rates (except for small CCPCs) is higher than that of the US for
non-manufacturing companies, and lower than that of the US for manufacturing
companies.  Because of other features of the corporate tax (various deductions
and credits) the marginal effective tax rate for manufacturing is about the
same in Canada as in the US, but marginal effective tax rates for services are
higher.  Several other countries (Sweden, the UK and Ireland) have lower rates
of tax.</p>

<p>Fortunately Canada is in the process of lowering corporate tax rates.  The
federal government reduced the general statutory rate by one percentage point
on January 1, 2001 and is committed to reducing this rate by six more
percentage points over the next three years.  Ontario reduced its general
corporate tax rate by 1.5 percentage points in 2001, and is committed to a
further six percentage point reduction over the next five years.  Alberta
reduced its rate to 13.9% this year and is committed to reducing the rate to
8.0% over the next 5 years.  The recently elected government of British
Columbia has announced a three precentage point reduction, effective on January
1, 2002.  When these federal and provincial rate reductions are fully
implemented in 2006, the average statutory corporate rate for large
corporations will be reduced to 32%.  This represents a decline of 11.3% for
large non-manufacturing firms and a decline of 3.0% for large manufacturing
firms.</p>

<p>These large statutory rate reductions generate significant reductions in
marginal effective tax rates (METRs)  for most non-manufacturing firms.  With
the exception of the Oil and Gas and Mining sectors, large non-manufacturing
firms will experience declines in METRs of 3.6 to 7.2 percentage points.  The
METR for large manufactures is projected decline by 2.5 percentage points.  At
current rates of tax in the US, these planned rate reductions would put METRs
in Canada 2½ to 3 percentage points below those in the US.  The statutory rate
for large corporations would be about 7 percentage points below the US rate. 
Even with these rate reductions, however, corporate taxes for large firms would
be higher in Canada relative to the UK, Sweden and Ireland.</p>

<h3>Principles for Efficient Taxation of Corporations</h3>

<p>The existing corporate tax system was examined extensively by the Technical
Committee on Business Taxation (The 'Mintz Committee').  Following other review
of the corporate income tax the Mintz Committee argued that a basic general
principle of business taxation should be neutrality, i.e. that the tax system
should not distort business decisions by favouring particular industries,
investments or activities.  The Mintz Committee also emphasized that the level
of business taxation should also be internationally competitive, i.e. that
rates of tax in Canada should not be higher than those of our major trading
partners.</p>

<p>Neutral tax treatment would entail marginal effective rates of tax which
would not vary across asset types or industries.  As the Committee found,
however, these rates varied greatly across assets, across industries, and by
size of corporation: the existing tax system was far from neutral.  There was
substantial room for improvement of Canada's corporate tax structure.</p>

<p>Non-neutral treatment is appropriate where market imperfections affect
investment decisions.  Two important cases where non-neutral treatment is
desirable are investment in Research and Development (R&amp;D) and investments
by small businesses.  R&amp;D investments can generate significant spillovers
or externalities which are not captured by the investing firm.  This provides
the justification for the various R&amp;D tax incentives under the corporate
income tax.  However, it may well be the case that Canada's tax treatment of
R&amp;D is too generous.  Currently investments in R&amp;D capital enjoy large
<u>negative</u> marginal effective tax rates (due to credits and
deductions).</p>

<p>In the case of small businesses, the typical small corporation may be
capital rationed i.e. the firm may have limited access to capital (or may force
prohibitive capital costs).  Such capital rationing may be mitigated by a lower
rate of tax on retained earnings of small businesses.  This is one
justification for Canada's generous treatment of small CCPCs.  The other is
personal/corporate tax integration, which is considered in the next
section.</p>

<h3>Corporate/Personal Tax Integration</h3>

<p>Ultimately the corporate income tax, like other general taxes on business,
is borne by individuals, whether in their capacity as shareholders/investors,
as consumers or as employees.  Some business taxes (eg. payroll taxes) are
eventually primarily shifted back to employees in the form of lower wages. 
Others (eg. sales taxes) are shifted forward to consumers through higher
product prices.  In the case of the corporate income tax the incidence of the
tax is ambiguous.  The Technical Committee took an eclectic view, arguing that
some portion of the CIT is borne by investors in Canada, and some by foreign
treasuries.</p>

<p>To the extent that the corporate tax is borne by investors, there will be
effects on savings and investment which adversely affect the rate of growth of
future potential output, thereby reducing the average growth of real income of
Canadians.  It is therefore most important to design an efficient corporate
income tax which minimizes these negative effects.  As well as being neutral
with respect to industries and assets, an efficient corporate tax should not
favour one form of financial capital (eg. debt) over another (eg. equity). 
Without integration and without a deduction for the 'normal' rate of return on
equity capital, corporate income taxation encourages debt (since interest is
deductible) over equity (since there is no deduction for the cost of equity
capital).  Under a so called 'classical' CIT with zero integration, interest
income is subject to tax only once, at the personal level, whereas income from
equity investments are taxed twice: as corporate profits under the CIT and as
dividends or capital gains under the PIT.  Full integration, which sets the
combined CIT/PIT rate to the PIT rate applicable to other income, eliminates
this distortion.</p>

<p>Furthermore, full integration eliminates another non-neutrality of a
'classical' corporate income tax: the distortion of incorporation decisions. 
Without full integration, the combined taxation of corporate source income
exceeds the taxation of comparable unincorporated businesses.<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Following the Tax Reforms of 1971, Canada's CIT was fully integrated for
small CCPCs, but only partially integrated for larger firms.  The basic
mechanism of integration is the gross-up and credit mechanism for dividends. 
This was set to achieve full integration for dividend income for firms subject
to the lower small business rate.  At the higher corporate tax rates faced by
large taxpaying firms, however, the dividend credit was insufficient to fully
compensate for corporate taxes paid.</p>

<p>Over the years the dividend credit has changed, along with changes in
statutory corporate rates.  In some years there has been over-integration for
small business, i.e., the dividend credit was generous enough to reduced the
combined tax on dividend income below that on other income.  With the provinces
levying differential rates of corporate tax on small business, and with federal
and provincial surtaxes, the situation has become more complex.  With provinces
having moved to a tax on income from a tax on tax PIT system, more complexity
may follow.  At present there is over-integration in some provinces and
under-integration in others. (However, the departures from full integration are
not large.)</p>

<h3>Recommendations of the Technical Committee on Business Taxation</h3>

<p>The recommendations of the Technical Committee were constrained by the
requirement that their overall package had to be 'revenue-neutral'.  Unless
rate reductions were to be 'self-financing' (through stimulative effects to
economic activity) rate reductions would have to be financed by base-broadening
measures.  Furthermore, the cost of any transitional relief to be provided to
industries adversely affected would be limited by the revenue neutral
requirement.</p>

<p>Since the committee was established in 1996, at a time when deficit
reduction dominated the fiscal policy agenda, this revenue neutral requirement
was an understandable constraint.  Now that Canada is achieving fiscal
surpluses, and the debate is about allocating the future fiscal dividend, this
revenue neutral constraint is no longer binding.  There should be room to
provide transitional relief to industries who would face increased tax burdens
through base broadening reforms together with lower statutory rates (or general
investment tax credit.</p>

<p>The key base broadening recommendations made by the Committee include:</p>

<p>Reduction of Capital Cost Allowance (CCA) rates for certain classes of
investment.</p>

<p>Phase out of the 100% write-off of R&amp;D Capital Assets, and reduction of
R&amp;D credits.</p>

<p>In consultation with the Provinces, restructuring the resource allowance to
apply to resource revenues net of all deductions.</p>

<p>Reduction of the rate of write-off of development costs from 30 to 25%.</p>

<p>Following a 5 year notification, the immediate writeoff of development
expenses in mining should be replaced by a 25% deduction on a declining balance
basis.</p>

<p>Various limitations on the deductibility of interest expenses for investment
in foreign affiliates (and other measures to tighten the taxation of
international investment income).</p>

<p>Phase out of the Atlantic Investment Credit.</p>

<p>Harmonization of the capital tax bases of the federal and provincial
governments, together with the elimination of the deductibility of provincial
capital taxes.</p>

<p>The Committee's estimates of the revenues to be gained by these base
broadening measures are summarized in table 2 below.</p>

<p>As is apparent, these recommended corporate tax measures would generate
about 2 billion in revenue (as these estimates were based on 1997 estimates,
the revenue impacts would be somewhat larger now).</p>

<p>The Mintz Committee also addressed the issue of integration and the taxation
of capital gains.  While supporting the continuation of the gross-up and credit
system for dividends, the Committee was concerned that the credit was too
generous in cases where corporate income tax paid was less than the amount
credited - e.g. where dividends were distributed from corporate income which
has been sheltered by deductions and/or credits.  The Committee proposed a
dividend distribution tax of 25%, payable by corporations.  As corporate and
provincial corporate profits taxes would be fully creditable against this
dividend distribution tax, it would mainly affect non-tax paying corporations,
and to a lesser extent CCPCs in provinces where there is over-integration of
dividend income.   The Committee estimated that this measure would generate a
revenue increase of $525 million  -$350 million for the federal government and
$175 million for the provinces.</p>

<p>The taxation of capital gains represents another component of integration. 
When capital gains are taxed at the same rate as dividends under the PIT,
dividends and retained earnings are subject to the same degree of integration. 
The Committee reviewed the argument for taxing capital gains at rates below the
rate on other income and concluded that the ¾ inclusion rate then in effect for
capital gains was appropriate.  I would question this conclusion, since the
effective rate of tax on capital gains was higher than the effective rate on
tax on dividends for top bracket taxpayers.  To bring these effective tax rates
into line for top bracket taxpayers, the inclusion rate should be reduced to
T. </p>

<p>The Committee also recommended that the $500,000 lifetime capital gains
exemption for farmers and owners of shares of CCPCs should be eliminated, to be
replaced with enhanced RRSP contributions which would treat such capital gains
as equivalent to earned income on a lifetime basis.  The Committee estimated
that this measure would generate an additional $450 million of revenue, divided
$275 million to the federal government and $175 million to the provinces.</p>

<p>When combined with the estimated revenue from the corporate tax changes, the
implementation of the dividend distribution tax and the changed treatment of
capital gains would altogether increase federal revenues by about two billion
dollars and provincial revenues by about one billion.  These reforms were
sufficient to finance the Committee's recommendation that the general federal
corporate tax rate be reduced to 20% and the provincial rate to 13%.</p>

<p>Regarding payroll taxes, the Committee focussed on the only federal payroll
tax: EI contributions.  As employers currently pay 1.4 times the employee
contribution rate, they nominally pay 58 percent of this tax.  Governments and
non-profit institutions contribute to EI; the Committee estimates that 75
percent of the employer payments are made by businesses.   While recognizing
that, in the long run this type of tax is largely (but not completely) shifted
back to workers, the Committee recognized that in the short run an increase in
the employer contribution rate could raise labour costs with adverse effects on
employment and economic growth.</p>

<p>The Committee's main concern was with the interindustry distribution of the
costs and benefits of EI payments.  A small number of industries have very high
benefit/contribution ratios, which means that these sectors are subsidized by
payroll taxes paid by firms in other sectors.  The Committee recommended that
an experience rating system for employers by gradually phased in.  Basically
they recommended that, as the large surplus in the EI "Account" permits
reductions in contribution rates, the reduction for employers be targetted to
employers who have had superior layoff experience.</p>

<p>Because governments would be 'superior' employers under this system, the
implementation of experience rating would reduce government payroll costs by
almost $300 million.</p>

<p>The Committee also expressed the view that the federal government should
reduce average EI premiums over time in order to bring revenues down to the
long run cost of the program.  However, no explicit rate targets were
recommended, and therefore no estimates of revenue impacts were provided.</p>

<h3>What Has Happened Since the Report of the Technical Committee?</h3>

<p><b>Key Federal Tax Measures Since 1997</b></p>

<p>The package of recommendations made by the Mintz Committee was revenue
neutral.  They could therefore have been implemented during the period of
fiscal restraints.  However, the federal government did not act immediately to
implement any of the Committee's recommendations.  The federal budget of 1998
provided some personal income tax relief targetted to low to middle income
taxpayers.  The basic employee contribution rate was reduced by 20¢ (and the
employer contribution rate by 28¢).<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=
""><sup>3</sup></a>  Otherwise, no significant changes to business taxes were
introduced.</p>

<p>The 1999 budget broadened the PIT relief to include middle to higher income
taxpayers.   Prior to the budget,  EI premia were again reduced - by 15¢ for
employees and 21¢ for employers.  The budget did introduce a measure which
reduced effective tax rates for electricity generation by extending the
Manufacturing and Processing credit to these firms.  This measure was phased in
over four years, and will reduce the statutory federal corporate rate by 7
percentage points when fully implemented in 2002.  While specific to the
electrical generation industry, this measure can be viewed as a small initial
step towards the more general corporate rate reductions recommended by the
Technical Committee.</p>

<p>With Budget 2000, the federal government finally made a major commitment to
reduce corporate income taxes.  The general corporate tax rate reductions
proposed were a one percentage point cut in 2001 and six additional percentage
point reduction within the five-year tax reduction plan.  These rate
reductions, moreover, were targeted to those firms which were paying the
highest statutory and effective rates.  The rate reductions do not apply to the
manufacturing and processing, mining, and oil and gas sectors.  While there was
no reduction in the rate for small businesses with profits below $200 thousand,
but the budget reduced the statutory rate on profits between $200 and $300
thousand to 21 percent in 2001.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=
""><sup>4</sup></a>  Two months before the budget, EI premiums were again
reduced  – by 15¢ for employees and 21¢ for employers.  Budget 2000 also
reduced the capital gains inclusion rate from ¾ to T, effective on budget day
(Feb 28, 2001).  This measure brought the top marginal rate applicable to these
gains in line with the tope marginal rate applicable to dividends.<a href=
"#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Although the corporate rate reductions represented an important step towards
improved international competitiveness and inter-industry rebalancing, there
was a great deal of uncertainty about the timing of the tax cuts.  This
uncertainty was substantially reduced by the Economic Statement and Budget
Update, October 18, 2000 (hereafter "The October 2000 Statement").  This
statement lays out a time-table of successive two percentage point corporate
rate cuts, with the general federal corporate tax rate reduced to 21 percent<a
href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><sup>6</sup></a> by 2004.   The October
2000 Statement also accelerated and enhanced the PIT reductions laid out in
Budget 2000.  The 'high income' surtax was eliminated, the low bracket rate was
reduced to 16%, the middle bracket rate was reduced to 22%, and a new 'upper
middle' bracket<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><sup>7</sup></a> was
created with a rate of 26%.</p>

<p>The October 2000 Statement also lowered the capital gains inclusion rate
from T to ½ effective October 18, 2000.  With the top federal marginal rate on
capital gains reduced to 14.5%, and with reduced  tax rates in many provinces,
tax rates on capital gains in Canada are becoming competitive with tax rates on
long term gains in the U.S.  Without changes to the dividend credit, however,
the tax rate on capital gains is now below the tax rate on dividends for top
bracket taxpayers.  This raises the prospect of 'surplus stripping' and
administrative countermeasures which would increase tax complexity.  I address
this issue in the section on recommendations below.</p>

<p><b>Key Provincial Tax Measures Since 1997</b></p>

<p>In 1998 several provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and
Manitoba) introduced personal income tax reductions, while Ontario continued to
implement its multi-year PIT tax reduction.  The corporate tax rate for small
businesses was reduced to 8.5% in British Columbia and Ontario.  Several
provinces introduced tax incentives for R&amp;D and specified investments such
as film production.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=
""><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>  In 1999, several provinces announced reductions in personal income tax
rates (or surtax rates).  The corporate rate for small business was reduced to
5.5% in British Columbia.  In Ontario, the phased reduction in corporate tax
rates for small business continued, with the rate dropping to 8%.<a href=
"#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><sup>9</sup></a> </p>

<p>In the year 2000, 9 of the 10 provinces elected to switch to a
"tax-on-income" PIT system (from the pre-existing "tax-on-tax" system).  This
system will, of course, permit greater flexibility in the design of provincial
personal income taxes.  Personal income taxes were reduced in several
provinces.  Alberta adopted a single rate for its PIT, set originally at 11%,
but subsequently reduced to 10.5%, combined with a large increase in personal
exemptions.  Corporate tax rates were reduced in four provinces.  British
Columbia reduced its corporate rate for small business to 4.75%.  Manitoba
reduced its small business rate to 7%.  In Ontario, the phased reduction in
taxes for small corporations continued, with the rate dropping to 6.5%.  More
importantly, the 2000 Ontario budget reduced the corporate tax rates for large
corporations – to 12% for manufacturers and to 14% for other firms.  Ontario
also announced a number of incentives for specific activities involving film,
publishing and other media.  New Brunswick reduced its corporate rate for small
business to 4.5%<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>In 2001 all provinces and territories adopted the 'tax-on-income system' for
their Personal Income Taxes.  In British Columbia, the new government announced
a major reduction in personal income taxes, retroactive to January 1, 2001. 
Small reductions in these taxes were implemented in other provinces (partly
through matching changes to federal brackets and indexing).  Corporate tax
rates were reduced in six provinces.  The new British Columbia government 
announced reductions in British Columbia's general corporate rate to 13.5%. 
Alberta announced a four year plan to reduce all corporate tax rates.  By 2004
the rate for large corporations will be down to 8%, and the rate for small
corporates to 3%.  Saskatchewan reduced its small business corporate rate to
6%.  Manitoba reduced its rate for small business to 5%, and announced a phased
reduction in general corporate rates of 0.5% per year over four years.  
Ontario announced a plan to reduce corporate taxes over four years.  When
completed in 2005, the rate for large corporations will be 8%, and for small
corporations 4%.  New Brunswick reduced its general corporate rate to 16%, and
its small business rate to 4%.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=
""><sup>11</sup></a></p>


<p><b>Overview of Statutory Corporate Tax Rates</b></p>

<p>Tables 3 and 4 summarize the changes in general corporate income tax rates
for large corporations and small businesses.  The data in table 3 make clear
that one of the major recommendations of the Mintz Committee is being
implemented.  Within five years combined federal/provincial statutory tax rates
for large firms in Alberta and Ontario will be brought down to 30% and in
Quebec to 31%.  Given the importance of these three provinces, the weighted
average  combined statutory rate for Canada as a whole will be reduced to 32%. 
This represents a decline of 11 percentage points relative to its level in
1997.  The weighted average level of the combined rate of tax for all provinces
would be one percentage point lower than the 33% level recommended by the
Technical Committee (although the Federal statutory rate would be about two
percentage points higher).</p>

<p>For small businesses, the federal statutory rate does not change, but many
provincial rates have been reduced by this year, and in Alberta, Ontario and
Saskatchewan, further rate cuts are planned.  When fully implemented, the
combined statutory rates for small business will be only 16.1% in Alberta, and
17.1% in Ontario.</p>

<p>I note that these low rates of corporate income tax for small businesses
mean these will be over-integration of the corporate and personal taxes in all
provinces and territories except for PEI and Quebec.<a href="#_ftn12" name=

<p><b>Base Broadening and Other Recommended Measures</b></p>

<p>With the exception of certain measures designed to tighten the taxation of
international investment income and of business profits of foreign owned
corporations, the corporate base-broadening recommendations of the Technical
Committee have so far been ignored.  This means that the federal corporate rate
reductions have largely been financed from the 'fiscal dividend'.  The upside
of this situation is that potential revenues from base broadening remain to
finance other desirable tax changes.</p>

<p>  The recommendations of the Committee to implement a dividend distribution
tax and to replace the $500,000 capital gains tax exemption have also so far
been ignored.  Finally, the Committee's recommendation for the gradual
implementation of experience rating for EI contributions of businesses has not
been acted upon.  However, as noted above, EI contribution rates have been reduced each year.</p>

<p>At the provincial level we have witnessed the implementation of a variety of
corporate tax measures which provide favourable tax treatment to designated
activities.  By and large these represent deviations from the principle of tax
neutrality endorsed by the Technical Committee.</p>


<p><b>An Evaluation of the Effects of Corporate Rate Reductions and Other
Measures<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><sup>13</sup></a></b></p>


<p>Most economic studies have suggested that the most distortionary revenue
sources are related to business taxes, particularly the corporate income tax. 
Effective tax rates on capital vary by industry, type of asset, size of firm
and business organization.   The business tax system is not only distortionary
but also quite complicated.  Some studies have suggested that each additional
dollar of corporate income tax levied, causes the Canadian economy to lose near
$1 in economic output.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=
""><sup>14</sup></a>  Therefore the total cost of raising one dollar of corporate
income tax revenue can be about two dollars, once these distortionary effects
of the tax are taken into account.</p>

<p>An ideal business tax system would be neutral with respect to different
industries, asset types, and different degrees of risk.  Any non-neutralities
in the system should be related to mitigation of the effects of market
imperfections.  Examples of corrective non-neutralities in the tax system
include favourable treatment of small business (to offset capital market
rationing) and incentives for research and development (in recognition of the
positive spillovers generated by an increase in knowledge or know-how).</p>

<p>In today's world, not only should business taxes be neutral but also they
should be levied at rates that are competitive internationally.  This is
especially important for the corporate income tax.  Given the relative ease
with which corporations can shift income from high to low-taxed countries
(without changing real economic activity), a country with a high corporate
income tax rate could find its tax base eroded significantly.  Recent studies
have shown that as corporate income tax rates are increased, the gain in
revenues is anywhere from 8 to 20 per cent less than what would be expected if
the tax base did not change.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=
""><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>Four years ago, the Technical Committee on Business Taxation submitted its
<u>Report</u> to the Minister of Finance.  This report recommended a more
neutral business tax system with lower and more competitive tax rates.</p>

<p>High effective marginal corporate rates deter investment, and inter-industry
and inter-asset variations in these effective rates distort the allocation of
capital.  Consequently, a reduction in the level of marginal effective tax
rates and a reduction in their variance are high priorities from the
standpoints of growth and efficiency.</p>

<p>The Technical Committee recommended that the general federal corporate tax
rate for large corporations be reduced by 9.1% points to 20% and average
provincial rates by one point from 14% to 13%.  For manufacturing income, the
reduction would be only 2.1% points, since the Committee also recommended that
the manufacturing and processing deduction be eliminated.</p>

<p>This measure above would reduce corporate tax revenues by $2.2 billion. 
However, the Committee also recommended a reduction in the average corporate
tax rate for small business, and a variety of base-broadening measures such
that their full set of measures would be approximately revenue neutral.</p>

<p>As the base broadening measures would tend to reduce the inter-market and
inter-asset variance of effective marginal rates, the combined package
recommended by the Committee  would improve efficiency.</p>

<p>Since the Committee's Report was released, developments abroad have made the
case for a further lowering of effective corporate tax rates in Canada more
important (Mintz, 2001).  Within the G7, Japan, Germany and Italy have all
reduced effective marginal rates substantially.  The UK, which previously had
the lowest effective marginal rate, also reduced their rate by two percentage
points.  As a result, Canada has become an outlier, with the highest effective
marginal rates of any of the G7 countries (except Japan).</p>

<p>Recent reforms in Scandinavia have resulted in companies being taxed at
corporate income tax rates below 30% in Finland, Sweden and Norway, and 32% in
Denmark.  However, the aggressive business tax policies of Ireland are the most
important case in point, since Ireland is the fastest growing OECD country of
the past decade, virtually doubling its per capita GDP in ten years.  While
Ireland has reduced tax rates on manufacturing and financial service income to
10%,<a href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><sup>16</sup></a> it also
eliminated a number of special ineffective preferences for investments.  After
pressure from the European Union, Ireland is implementing a corporate income
tax rate of 12.5% by the year 2004 that will apply to all businesses.  As shown
later, Ireland and Sweden have a far more favourable tax treatment of
investments compared to Canada.</p>

<p><b>Effects of Budget 2000</b></p>

<p>With the 2000 budget and the October 2000 statement, the federal government
committed itself to a one percentage point reduction in corporate income tax
rates for the broad service sector<a href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=
""><sup>17</sup></a> in 2001, followed by four two percentage point cuts.  It
indicated that it would reduce the corporate income tax rate from 28 points to
21 points by the year 2004-5 for active business income in non-resource,
non-manufacturing sectors. It also increased capital cost writeoffs for railway
assets, utility equipment and manufacturing equipment subject to obsolescence. 
The government also introduced a few tightening provisions – tighter
thin-capitalization rules for debt owed to related non-residents, the abolition
of non-resident owned companies and adjustments for research and development
expense deductions for provincial deductions in lieu of investment tax credit
programs. </p>

<p>The 2000 budget business tax changes took many observers by surprise.  The
cut in corporate income tax rates, although small in the first year, are
significant when fully implemented.  The rate cuts, moreover, would be focussed
on the broad service sector, thereby reducing inter-industry distortions.  Tax
rates on manufacturing and processing income as well as on resource profits
would remain unchanged.</p>

<p>The impact of the 2000 budget changes and of planned provincial corporate
rate reductions can be seen in Table 5.  The small changes introduced for the
year 2001 have little impact on effective tax rates on capital.  Significant
variation in effective tax rates would remain across all sectors.  When the
proposed corporate rate reductions are fully in effect in 2004-5, they have a
much more dramatic impact.  Most industries, except for mining, oil and gas,
and manufacturing, would experience a sharp decline in the effective tax rate
by over 4 percentage points.  Although this tax reform is in the right
direction, it still leaves considerable variation in effective tax rates on
capital across industries and, in some cases, rates remain far too high thereby
discouraging investment.</p>

<p>Moreover, these changes will take five years to complete.  This is rather
disappointing progress given the substantial reforms taking place around the
world, as mentioned above.  In the near term the Canadian tax system will
remain non-competitive as seen in Table 6 and, as discussed below.</p>

<p>In 1996, Canada's effective tax rate on capital invested in manufacturing
was comparable to the United States and lower than that found in Germany,
France, Italy, and Japan and higher than rates in the United Kingdom, Sweden
and Ireland.  The broad service sector was more highly taxed in Canada compared
especially to the United States and to most countries, except Germany, Italy
and Japan.</p>

<p>In the current year and in 2001, Canada's competitive position will erode as
a result of reforms in many countries.  In 2000, Canada's effective tax rate in
manufacturing, while still comparable to the US, is below only Germany's. 
However, in 2001, Germany's substantial reform of its system will put its
effective tax rate well below Canada's.  For services, in the year 2001
Canada's effective tax rate is well above most countries.</p>

<p>With prospective reductions in federal and provincial statutory corporate
tax rates, by 2006, Canada's effective tax rate on capital will be competitive
with the US but still above those of the UK, Sweden and Ireland.  However, it
is likely that many of these countries will undertake further changes to their
corporate income tax systems.  It can be expected that in five years
further reductions in corporate income tax rates will take place in many countries
combined with initiatives to broaden their tax bases. </p>

<p><b>The Need for Further Reforms</b></p>

<p>If all of the Technical Committee's recommendations were implemented, the
dispersion of marginal effective rates of tax or capital across industries and
assets would be reduced.  This should entail some efficiency gains by improving
the allocation of capital.</p>

<p>However, these recommendations entail virtually <u>no</u> change in
<u>average</u> effective marginal tax rates.  This is not surprising, given the
revenue neutral constraint faced by the committee.  On the other hand, the 2000
Budget would cut effective tax rates but fails to move aggressively in reducing
non-neutralities and rates.  Once the requirement of revenue neutrality is
relaxed, it is feasible to design tax reductions to stimulate investment and
make the tax system more efficient.  We accept the committee's view that
R&amp;D already receives extraordinarily favourable tax treatment in Canada. 
Therefore, our focus should be on stimulating capital investment.</p>

<p>The Technical Committee report was partly criticized for eliminating a
number of important special preferences for certain business activities in
order to help cover the revenue loss arising from corporate income tax rate
reductions.  While general reductions in corporate statutory rates are of
benefit to all forms of capital investment, they may result in greater losses
in revenue compared to investment tax credits.  Some investment tax credits are
appropriate since they can encourage investments in specific activities without
distorting the tax base used by federal and provincial governments for
allocating corporate income to the provinces.  In our view, it may be
appropriate to consider investment tax credits for certain activities that are
insufficient due to market imperfections (undiversifiable risky investments or
technology-related investments) and to smooth over transitional impacts of tax
reform that eliminates special preferences for specific industrial activities
(e.g. new mine assets).</p>

<p>Using the tax evaluation model maintained at the Institute for International
Business, we have evaluated the impact of reduced statutory rates and
investment tax credits on marginal effective rates on investments in new
capital.</p>

<p>Table 7 presents effective marginal rates for 2000 (the "base case") and
what effective marginal rates would be under four alternatives.  The first two
incorporate reductions of statutory rates of 1 and 3 percentage points.  The
third incorporates a 1% investment credit for machinery and equipment, and the
fourth incorporates a 1% investment credit for all plant and equipment.</p>

<p>The results indicate that a 3% point reduction in the statutory rate would
reduce effective marginal rates in the broadly defined service sector by about
2 percentage points.  Effective rates in manufacturing would drop by 1.7
percentage points.  Effective rates in the resource sector would actually
increase, because of the interaction of statutory rates with various credits
and allowances.</p>

<p>Investment tax credits (ITCs) would reduce marginal effective tax rate for
all industries.  A general ITC of 1% has a stronger effect than a 3% rate cut
for oil and gas, mining, and transportation and communications; has about the
same effect for manufacturing and forestry; and has a weaker effect in the
other service sectors and construction.  Looking at the inter-industry
variability of METRs, it would appear that a 3% statutory rate cut would reduce
these distortions, whereas an ITC would increase them somewhat.</p>

<p><b>International Comparisons and International Competitiveness</b> </p>

<p>In an open economy, the business tax structure must be designed with an eye
to the likely response of multi-national corporations (MNCs) as well as to its
longer term effects on international competitiveness.</p>

<p>Attention should be paid to both statutory and effective marginal rates. 
Statutory rate differentials may provide incentives for MNCs to shift expenses
to and income away from high tax reductions, through transfer pricing and debt
management practices.  Statutory rates differences may also influence location
decisions. </p>

<p>Current and projected corporate statutory rates for OECD countries are
presented in table 8.  The corporate statutory rate for large manufacturers in
Canada lies in the middle of this group of countries, but the statutory rate
for large non-manufacturing firms is currently above all the other countries
(except for Germany and Japan).  Projected rates for 2006 indicate that the
Canadian corporate tax rate will be below the level of the US, Japan, Germany
and France, but remain higher than many other countries.</p>

<p>Differences in effective marginal tax rates also provide incentives for
MNC's to adjust their <b><u>real</u></b> capital stocks, increasing investment
in countries with relatively low effective marginal rates relative to other
countries.</p>

<p>In order to prevent substantial revenue erosion, statutory rates should not
be higher than rates typically found in other industrialized countries where
MNC investments take place.  In order to stimulate investment and provide
economic growth, effective tax rates on capital should be lower than in other
competing jurisdictions.</p>

<p>The implementation of the Technical Committee's recommendations regarding
statutory rates would  establish Canada's rates at the OECD average and well
below U.S. statutory rates, thereby eliminating the principal sources of
revenue erosion via debt shifting and transfer pricing.   However, as noted
above, the 2000 Budget would reduce effective marginal rates of tax on
investment by 4 points for service sectors but have little impact on
manufacturing and resource sectors.</p>

<p>A reduction in the combined general corporate income tax rate to 30% instead
of 32%</p>

<p>Notes:</p>

<p><sup>a</sup>   The 1996 rates are based on the former Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
<i>1997 International Tax Summaries</i> and the 1999 rates are adopted from the
KPMG Corporate Tax Rates Survey, January 1999, unless otherwise specified.</p>

<p><sup>b</sup>   The rate is a combination of the federal CIT rate (22.1% and
29.1% respectively for manufacturing and others) and the average of provincial
CIT rates that is weighted by the provincial GDP by industry.  The minor
difference between the two years reflects some changes in provincial CIT
rates.</p>

<p><sup>c</sup> This is a weighted average of all industries.  Note that the
current general CIT rate of 43% will still be applicable to the resources
sector, which also enjoys various preferential tax treatments unavailable to
any non-resource sectors.</p>

<p><sup>d</sup>   The rate is a combination of the corporate income tax rate of
33 1/3% and the surtax of 10% and 20% respectively. The lower surtax is applied
to smaller-scaled firms that are mainly owned by individuals. For year 2000 and
future years, the lower rate will apply to all firms. (See Ernst &amp; Young,
<i>1999 Worldwide Corporate Tax Guide,</i> for details.)</p>

<p><sup>e </sup> Our estimate based on to Ernst &amp; Young, <i>2000 Worldwide
Corporate Tax Guide.</i> It includes a corporate income tax rate of 40%, an
average trade tax of 16.75% (ranged from 13% to 20.5%) which is deductible for
CIT purpose, and a surcharge of 5.5% on CIT payable.</p>

<p><sup>f</sup>  Refer to <i>Tax Notes International</i>, Vol. 20, No. 4, 24
January 2000.</p>

<p><sup>g</sup>  The higher rate (41.3%) includes a general corporate income
tax rate of 37 per cent and a regional tax of 4.25 per cent. The latter is
levied on the Italian-source income from productive activities, which includes
interest payments and labour cost. The general CIT rate may be reduced to 19
per cent for qualifying taxable income corresponding to the ordinary
remuneration (currently 7 per cent) of the net equity increase.  However, the
average corporate income tax rate for a company may not fall below 27 per cent,
which, combined with the regional tax rate of 4.25 per cent, resulted in the
lower aggregated income tax rate of 31.3 per cent.</p>

<p><sup>h</sup>  Effective as of April 1, 1999.</p>

<p><sup>i</sup>  Our estimate based on an average state corporate income tax
rate of 6.5% (ranged from 1 to 12%).</p>

<p>Accompanied by base-broadening would reduce typical marginal effective tax
rates for non-resource firms by about 1 to 1½  points.  The lower statutory
rate would also make Canada more attractive relative to other countries,
providing added deterrence to debt shifting and transfer pricing by MNEs.</p>

<p>Because a reduction in corporate statutory rates would stimulate an increase
in the tax base, the revenue costs are somewhat attenuated.  The Technical
Committee estimates that the elasticity of the corporate tax base with respect
to a reduction in tax rates is about 0.15.  Based on this elasticity,  in 1998
for example, a 2% point reduction in all corporate tax rates would involve a
revenue loss of about $1.3 billion of federal corporate tax revenue
(representing about 7% of federal corporate tax revenues)<a href="#_ftn18"
name="_ftnref18" title=""><sup>18</sup></a>.</p>

<p>In future years, moreover, this relative revenue loss would be further
attenuated, as the lower corporate tax rates lead to higher investment, a
higher capital stock, and hence increased labour productivity and real
output.</p>


<h3>9.  Summary</h3>

<p><b>Recommendations for Corporate Taxes</b></p>

<p>Implement the 7 percentage point reduction in the general corporate rate in
Budget 2000 on a timely basis, as is laid out in the October 2000 Statement. 
The 1 percent point rate reduction scheduled for January 1, 2001 should be
followed by three annual reductions of 2 percentage points over the following
three years.</p>

<p>Implement the base broadening and other recommendations of the Report of the
Technical Committee (including the elimination of the 4% corporate surtax). 
This will permit additional reductions of federal and provincial statutory
rates, bringing the combined rate close to 30%.</p>

<p>Provide selective investment credits which provide transitional relief for
industries adversely affected by these reforms.</p>

<p><b>Recommendations for Corporate/Personal Income Tax Integration</b></p>

<p>As noted above, with growing concern about high tax rates affecting Canada's
international competitive position, the federal government has recently moved
to lower substantially taxes on capital gains, and plans to reduce corporate
tax rates significantly over the next 4 years.  Some provinces have recently
reduced these taxes, and others plan future reductions.</p>

<p>While these reductions in effective marginal rates on capital income are
welcome, the reduction in capital gains taxes has created a differential
between taxes on these gains and taxes on dividends, thereby providing an
incentive for conversion of dividends into capital gains.  Resolving this issue
is now more difficult, because all provinces have moved to a tax on income
basis.  In this section I consider alternative ways of dealing with this
problem.</p>

<p>There are several features of the existing income tax system which prevent
the establishment of equal effective marginal tax rates on capital gains,
dividends and other income.</p>

<p>There is not full integration of the corporate and personal income tax
system.  While the system has been designed to approximately integrate
corporate and personal taxes for small CCPCs, for all other corporations,
integration is only partial.  Since the rate of corporate tax differs between
small CCPCs and other corporations, a common dividend credit rate alone cannot
achieve perfect integration for both types of firms.  Finally, the existence of
the $500 K capital gains exemption for shares of qualifying CCPCs prevents
equalization of taxes on the three categories of income derived from such
companies. </p>

<p>Since a major tax reform that equalized corporate rates, provides full
integration and abolishes the special capital gains exemption is not in the
cards what is the 'second best' solution?  As the differential treatment of
small CCPCs lies at the heart of the problem, we first consider the appropriate
taxes rates on dividends for these firms, and then consider the tax treatment
of other companies.  For many small CCPCs the special capital gains exemption
reduces the effective rate of tax on capital gains to zero.  The existence of
this exemption has necessitated the implementation of many rules to determine
how firms may qualify for the exemption.  These rules effectively prevent the
generation of capital gains through either dividend strips or the accumulation
of financial assets.</p>

<p>For small CCPCs, the most important issue is therefore the equalization of
taxes on dividends and on other income paid by these firms (wages and salaries,
bonuses, etc.)   This can be accomplished by setting federal and provincial net
dividend credit rates so as to achieve perfect integration of taxes on dividend
income for these firms.  One way of doing this is to implement dividend
distribution taxes on dividends paid from income eligible for the small
business deduction.</p>

<p>For other companies (public corporations, large CCPCs and other private
corporations) the most important issue is the equalization of taxes on
dividends and capital gains for top bracket tax payers.  If the rate of tax on
dividends is higher than the rate of tax on capital gains, these firms would
have an incentive to convert dividends into capital gains through share
buybacks and other financial arrangements.</p>


<p>How do we implement these recommendations?  For all corporations except
small CCPCs, I propose that the dividend gross-up and credit system be changed
to equalize marginal rates on dividends and capital gains for individuals in
the highest marginal rate bracket.  Specifically, I recommend that the dividend
gross-up factor be increased to one third, and the federal dividend credit
increased to set the top marginal federal tax rate on dividends at 14.5%, equal
to the top marginal federal tax rate on realized capital gains.</p>

<p>I assume that participating provinces will accept the federal definition of
taxable income, so that the 50% capital gains inclusion rate and the one third
dividend gross-up enter the provincial income tax base.  Each province should
then set its dividend credit so as to equalize its top marginal rate on
dividends with its top marginal rate on capital gains.</p>

<p>At current corporate tax rates, this system will not provide complete
integration for large corporations.  However, the degree of integration will
increase as planned future corporate rate reductions are put into effect.</p>
