                Studies in two prestigious scientific journals say dark chocolate 
                -- but not white chocolate or milk chocolate -- is good for you.

                What is it about dark chocolate? <br />
                <br />
                The answer is plant phenols -- cocoa phenols, to be exact. These 
                compounds are known to lower blood pressure. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chocolates 
                made in Europe are generally richer in cocoa phenols than those 
                made in the U.S. So if you're going to try this at home, remember: 
                Darker is better. </font></p>

              <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Flavonoids 
                are found in a wide array of foods and beverages, such as cranberries, 
                apples, peanuts, chocolate, onions, tea and red wine. There are 
                more than 4,000 flavonoid compounds; flavonoids are a subgroup 
                of a large class called polyphenols.<br />
                <br />

                a question normally asked at a social gathering, flavonoids have 
                become quite a hot topic in the media and in scientific journals. 
                </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Flavonoids 
                provide important protective benefits to plants, such as in repairing 
                damage and shielding from environmental toxins. When we consume 
                plant-based foods rich in flavonoids, it appears that we also 
                benefit from this &quot;antioxidant&quot; power. Antioxidants 
                are believed to help the body's cells resist damage caused by 
                free radicals, formed by normal bodily processes such as breathing 
                or environmental contaminants like cigarette smoke. When the body 
                lacks adequate levels of antioxidants, free radical damage ensues, 
                leading to increases in LDL-cholesterol oxidation and plaque formation 
                on arterial walls.</font></p>

              <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Before you 
                grab a chocolate candy bar or slice of chocolate cake, let's look 
                at what forms of chocolate would be ideal over others:</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When cocoa 
                is processed into your favorite chocolate products, it goes through 
                several steps to reduce its naturally pungent taste. Flavonoids 
                (polyphenols) provide this pungent taste. The more chocolate is 
                processed (such as fermentation, alkalizing, roasting), the more 
                flavonoids are lost. <br />
                <br />
                To date, dark chocolate appears to retain the highest level of 
                flavonoids. So your best bet is to choose dark chocolate over 
                milk chocolate. <br />
                <br />
                Some chocolate manufacturers are studying ways to retain the highest 
                level of flavonoids while still providing acceptable taste. Stay 
                tuned for more information in this area. <br />
                <br />
                <b> What about all of the fat in chocolate? </b></font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You may be 
                surprised to find out that chocolate isn't as bad as once perceived. 
                The fat in chocolate, from cocoa butter, is comprised of equal 
                amounts of oleic acid (a heart-healthy monounsaturated fat also 
                found in olive oil), stearic and palmitic acids. Stearic and palmitic 
                acids are forms of saturated fat. Saturated fats are linked to 
                increases in LDL-cholesterol and risk for heart disease. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Research indicates 
                that stearic acid appears to have a neutral effect on cholesterol, 
                neither raising nor lowering LDL-cholesterol levels. Palmitic 
                acid on the other hand, does affect cholesterol levels but only 
                comprises one-third of the fat calories in chocolate. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This great 
                news does not give us a license to consume as much dark chocolate 
                as we'd like. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>First</b>, 
                be cautious as to the type of dark chocolate you choose: chewy 
                caramel-marshmallow-nut-covered dark chocolate is by no means 
                a heart-healthy food option. What wreaks havoc on most chocolate 
                products is the additional fat and calories added from other ingredients. 
                </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Second</b>, 
                there is currently no established serving of chocolate to reap 
                the touted cardiovascular benefits. However, what we do know is 
                you no longer need to feel guilty if you enjoy a small piece of

&quot;Those volunteers who had dark chocolate had a 20 per cent increase

Antioxidants are involved in lowering the levels of free-radicals in the
