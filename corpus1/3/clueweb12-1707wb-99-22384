<h2>Introduction</h2><h2>Introduction:  A Word on Assumptions, Methods, and Aims</h2>
<p><a name="s1">&sect;1.</a> This effort is a continuation of two earlier books.   One of these, <i>The Best of the Achaeans</i>,
<a href="#s1n1"><sup>1</a><a name="anch1n1"></sup></a>
centered on the role of oral tradition in early Greek achievements of poetic
artistry and precision of expression, with Homer in the forefront.  The task was difficult, in that I was
challenging two influential stances that remain fashionable among experts in Greek literature.  One of
these can be described as an eagerness to explain whatever we admire in Homer as something that must
transcend any oral traditions.  This is to ignore, I argued, the communicative power of tradition itself:  in
seeking to discover the genius of invention in the surviving examples of early Greek epic, we run the risk
of underrating the continuum of oral tradition from which these examples had emerged.
<a href="#s1n2"><sup>2</a><a name="anch1n2"></sup></a>
To say this much is not to go so far as to say <i>das Volk dichtet</i>:  it is a romantic notion to make
generalized claims about
folk creativity--claims that in fact blur the observable dynamics of oral tradition within society.
<a href="#s1n3"><sup>3</a><a name="anch1n3"></sup></a>
It is just as romantic, however, for latter-day critics to attribute the evidence of artistry in Homeric poetry
to a genius who is emancipated from oral tradition.  Such an attitude is reminiscent of Chateaubriand's
notion of "mother-geniuses" (<i>g&eacute;nies m&egrave;res</i>), as dissected by M. M. Bakhtin.
<a href="#s1n4"><sup>4</a><a name="anch1n4"></sup></a>
<p><a name="s2">&sect;2.</a> The other influential stance that I challenged in <i>Best of the Achaeans</i>
is a general reluctance to recognize artistic values that belonged only to the
ancient Greeks and no longer to us.  This attitude presumes that we are the heirs to everything of theirs
that qualifies as artistic and sophisticated, and whatever fails to match our own criteria of these qualities is
more "primitive" and therefore less sophisticated.  I am reminded of "God's library," as Voltaire pictures it (<i>Temple du go&ucirc;t</i>, 1732), where the Muses must busy themselves with
revising and abridging the existing great books.
<p><a name="s3">&sect;3.</a> Such an attitude encourages the rejection of any interpretation that recognizes precision and subtlety in
early Greek poetics.  One critic, after disagreeing in detail with various points that I made about allusions
in early Greek literature, decided to call a halt after reading the first three of my twenty chapters; he
questioned whether he should even have made the effort of going that far into the book since "I felt sure
(and I believe many would agree with me) that so sophisticated a technique of allusions is quite alien to
the early epic and would hardly be found even in Hellenistic poetry."
<a href="#s3n1"><sup>1</a><a name="anch3n1"></sup></a>
I cling to the hope of persuading such critics with my present effort, in
which I propose to widen the scope of inquiry.
<a href="#s3n2"><sup>2</a><a name="anch3n2"></sup></a>
Whereas <i>The Best of the Achaeans</i> concerned primarily the epic tradition, this book is an attempt
to confront, at least in broad outlines, the full range of poetic and song-making traditions in early Greek
civilization.  Without such a confrontation, I now fear, my efforts in the previous books may be
permanently misunderstood by some.  <i>Pindar's Homer</i> provides the background for <i>The Best of the Achaeans</i>.
<p><a name="s4">&sect;4.</a> In widening the scope, I shift the focus from epic to lyric, as
represented primarily by the compositions of Alcman, Stesichorus, Alcaeus, Sappho, Ibycus, Anacreon,
Simonides, Bacchylides, and Pindar.
<a href="#s4n1"><sup>1</a><a name="anch4n1"></sup></a>
The conventional dating of these figures covers a period stretching roughly
from 650 to 450 B.C.,
<a href="#s4n2"><sup>2</a><a name="anch4n2"></sup></a>
and hereafter I refer to this period as the age of Archaic Greek
lyric.  The task becomes even more difficult, in face of yet another
influential line of thought:  I am challenging the tenaciously fashionable notion, which takes shape in
many variations, that Archaic Greek lyric represents the rise of individual innovation over collective
tradition.  It can be said straightaway that such a notion lacks the perspectives of social anthropology.
Beyond that, it
would be premature at this point to enter into the controversy, which would engulf the reader in a
bibliographical quagmire.  Instead this notion is challenged by a variety of arguments, both explicit and
implicit, that extend throughout this book.
<p><a name="s5">&sect;5.</a> Which brings me to mention the other of the two earlier books that the
present work continues, <i>Comparative Studies in Greek and Indic Meter</i>.
<a href="#s5n1"><sup>1</a><a name="anch5n1"></sup></a>
The basic thesis was that the meter known as the dactylic
hexameter of Greek epic originated from lyric meters and that these lyric
meters have an ancient heritage that can at least be partially recovered
through the comparative method of Indo-European linguistics.
<a href="#s5n2"><sup>2</a><a name="anch5n2"></sup></a>
This is not to say that lyric is necessarily older than epic or that epic did not influence lyric as well as the
other way around.  Rather the point is simply that Greek lyric represents a tradition--or various
traditions--in its own right, and that the form of Greek epic can be explained as a differentiation of
various forms that we find in Greek lyric.  This thesis, however, raises many questions about the very
concepts of lyric and epic, and it is to these questions that I now turn.
<a href="#s5n3"><sup>3</a><a name="anch5n3"></sup></a>
<p><a name="s6">&sect;6.</a>   As the work proceeds, the definition of <i>lyric</i> will progressively broaden, to the
point that lyric becomes, for all practical purposes, the basis for defining <i>epic</i>, rather than the
other way around.  This point is reflected in the subtitle:  <i>The Lyric Possession of an Epic Past</i>.
I chose the word <i>possession</i> because the preoccupation of Greek poetry with the application of the
past to the here and now is in itself an exercise of political power.
<a href="#s6n1"><sup>1</a><a name="anch6n1"></sup></a>
Moreover, there is a side connotation of the poet's
"possession," or inspiration, <i>by</i> the spirits of the heroic past.
<a href="#s6n2"><sup>2</a><a name="anch6n2"></sup></a>
In using the word this way, I have in mind the celebrated passage retelling the ecstatic "seizure" of the
composer in Diderot's <i>Le neveu de Rameau</i>--a seizure that activates a panorama of
musical, poetic, and dramatic performance.
<p><a name="s7">&sect;7.</a> Of all the poets of Archaic lyric, I choose Pindar as the centerpiece.  Along with his near-contemporary,
Bacchylides, Pindar is not only the latest but also the last in the canon of lyric poets as transmitted by the
Alexandrian editors.  The last securely datable poem of Pindar,
<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/lookup?lookup=Pind.+P.+8"><i>Pythian</i>8</a>, was composed
for performance in 446 B.C. (for Bacchylides, the last datable compositions are <i>Odes</i> 6 and 7,
performed in 452 B.C.).
<p><a name="s8">&sect;8.</a> There are two reasons for my focus on Pindar.  One concerns the
specific form--or, better, forms--of his lyric poetry, specifically its metrical forms, and the
relationship of these forms to the form of epic.  The other reason relates to the content of this poetry, in
particular, what it says both explicitly and implicitly about the connections between epic and lyric.
<p><a name="s9">&sect;9.</a> Which brings me to a point of principle.  Throughout I shall pay close attention to the relationship
between poetic form and content.  This relationship reveals the tradition that shapes both the poet and the
poetry, and for me it is the poetic tradition itself that serves as the primary empirical evidence at my
disposal.  For others, however, what the poet says about anything counts as raw data, serving as the basis
for a "scientific" reconstruction of the poet and the poet's world, as also for any educated second-guessing
about the poet's reasons for saying what is said in the poetry.  The second-guessing can then lead to
various opinions about what we are or are not permitted to believe about the poet's testimony--all in
accordance with our own privileged sense of verisimilitude.  It is as if the poet's words existed in a
vacuum, just waiting to be discovered as direct information about the past, for the exclusive use of future
generations.  I prefer instead to treat the poetic tradition itself as the primary evidence, as manifested
mainly in the language of the surviving texts.
<p><a name="s10">&sect;10.</a> Treating the actual language of poetic tradition as my primary evidence, I must refer, and refer often, to the
perspectives of linguistics.  I hope to do so, however, without encumbering the reader with an
overabundance of technicalities.  The few explicit linguistics concepts that do occur in this book are
fundamental, and it makes sense to prepare the reader for two of them immediately.
<p><a name="s11">&sect;11.</a>   One of these concepts of linguistics is the distinction between <i>synchronic</i> and
<i>diachronic</i>.    By <i>synchronic</i> I mean the workings of a system as it exists at a given time
and place; by
<i>diachronic,</i>  the transformations of this system through time.
<a href="#s11n1"><sup>1</a><a name="anch11n1"></sup></a>
To avoid confusion, I choose to use these terms consistently from the
standpoint of an outsider who is thinking about a given system, not from the standpoint of an insider who
is thinking within that system.  The diachronic perspective, as we see throughout this book, is essential
for understanding the relationship of form and content in terms of such
categories as <i>theme</i>, <i>formula</i>, and <i>meter</i>.
<a href="#s11n2"><sup>2</a><a name="anch11n2"></sup></a>
I should warn at the outset, however, that the
diachronic perspective cannot suffice for the description, the classification, of a <i>system</i> as it exists
at a given time and place.  For that, the synchronic perspective is essential.
<p><a name="s12">&sect;12.</a>   The second of the two basic concepts of linguistics that I use throughout this book is the
distinction, from a synchronic perspective, between the <i>marked</i> and <i>unmarked</i> members of
any opposition within the system of language.  These terms are defined as follows by Roman Jakobson:
"The general meaning of a marked category states the presence of a certain (whether positive or negative)
property A; the general meaning of the corresponding unmarked category states nothing about the presence
of A."
<a href="#s12n1"><sup>1</a><a name="anch12n1"></sup></a>
The unmarked category is the general category, which can include the
marked category, whereas the reverse situation cannot hold.  For example, in an opposition of the English
words <i>long</i> and <i>short</i>, the unmarked member of the opposition is <i>long</i> because it
can be used not only as the opposite of <i>short</i> ("I am reading a long book, not a short one") but
also as the general category ("how long is this book?").  In an opposition of <i>interesting</i> and
<i>boring</i>, the unmarked member is <i>interesting</i>:  if we say "A is more interesting than B,"
we do not necessarily mean that both A and B are interesting or that B is boring, whereas "A is more
boring than B" presupposes that both A and B are boring.  To ask a question like "how interesting is
this?" does not commit the questioner, unlike "how boring is this?"  Further, in an opposition of
<i>day</i> and <i>night</i>, the unmarked member is <i>day,</i> which serves not only as the
opposite of <i>night</i> ("it is daytime, not nighttime") but also as the general category ("there are seven
days in the week").
<a href="#s12n2"><sup>2</a><a name="anch12n2"></sup></a>
To ask "how short?" is to presuppose shortness, whereas "how long?" does
not presuppose either shortness or length.   Thus the marked member, as in
the case of <i>short</i>, is defined in terms of the unmarked member, in this case, <i>long</i>--and
not the other way around.
<p><a name="s13">&sect;13.</a>   Where the marked member is a semantic subcategory of the unmarked member, we may be
witnessing the reflex of an older situation where the form of the marked member had once been assigned
the function currently held by the form of the unmarked member. Such a pattern of semantic evolution is
known in linguistic theory as Kurylowicz's  fourth law of analogy:  when
two forms come into competiton for one function, the newer form may
take over that function while the older form may become relegated to a subcategory of its earlier
function.
<a href="#s13n1"><sup>1</a><a name="anch13n1"></sup></a>
<p><a name="s14">&sect;14.</a> The unmarked member is inclusive, in that the marked member can
be an aspect of the unmarked.  It can be exclusive, however, if it negates the marked member, as when we
say  "that is not <i>short</i>, it is <i>long</i>."  The negation of the marked by the unmarked has been
called the <i>minus interpretation</i> of the unmarked (for example, "long, not short"), as distinct from
the <i>zero interpretation</i> (for example, "long"); the assertion of the marked member is the
<i>plus interpretation</i> (for example, "short," or "short, not long").
<a href="#s14n1"><sup>1</a><a name="anch14n1"></sup></a>
The term <i>plus interpretation</i> designates not "positive" but "marked, either negatively or
positively."
<p><a name="s15">&sect;15.</a>   The zero interpretation of the unmarked member includes, as an overarching principle,
both the minus interpretation of the unmarked member and the plus interpretation of the marked member.
The opposition of <i>long</i> and <i>short</i> is a matter of length.  Further, the opposition of
unmarked <i>order</i> and marked <i>disorder</i> is a matter of overall order.  I cite a particularly
interesting example from Greek metrics, an Archaic eight-syllable metrical unit known as the
<i>choriambic dimeter</i>:

<p><blockquote>xxxx_oo_
<a href="#s15n1"><sup>1</a><a name="anch15n1"></sup></a></blockquote>

This unit consists of a "disordered" first half, four syllables that display a
wide variety of possible combinations of long (_) and short (o) quantities,
such as ____, ___o, _o__, _o_o, o___, o__o, _o_o,
<a href="#s15n2"><sup>2</a><a name="anch15n2"></sup></a>
followed by an "ordered" second half, four syllables that rigidly follow the
pattern _oo_.   There is a principle of order even in the disorder of the first
half, as
we can see from a constraint that escapes notice at first sight.  The constraint is this:  the first half does
not allow just any possible combination of longs and shorts.  One pattern in particular, _oo_, is avoided
in the disordered first half, and this pattern _oo_ is precisely the ordered pattern of the second half.
<a href="#s15n3"><sup>3</a><a name="anch15n3"></sup></a>
In other words it is a matter of overarching order that the first half be
disorder as opposed to the order of the second half.  The first half is the
plus-interpretation of disorder, the second half is the
minus interpretation of order, while the two halves together comprise the zero interpretation of order.
<a href="#s15n4"><sup>4</a><a name="anch15n4"></sup></a>
As we shall see later, such an arrangement on the level of form is typical of the
thought patterns of myth making on the level of content:  in the stories of myth, the opposition of
disorder and order, of discord and
concord, serves to achieve an overall concept of <i>order, concord</i>.
<a href="#s15n5"><sup>5</a><a name="anch15n5"></sup></a>
More specifically the opposition of social division and integration serves to achieve an overall concept of
<i>integration</i>.
<a href="#s15n6"><sup>6</a><a name="anch15n6"></sup></a>
Further, the opposition of alien and native serves to achieve an overall concept of <i>native</i>.
<a href="#s15n7"><sup>7</a><a name="anch15n7"></sup></a>
<p><a name="s16">&sect;16.</a>   The distinction of <i>marked-unmarked</i> can be further
applied in a variety of contexts, starting in Chapter 1 with an extended discussion  of song and poetry as
distinct from "everyday" language.  I apply it even here with the intent of challenging a common
misconception about a term that is central to the whole book, <i>oral poetry</i>.  The descriptive term
<i>oral</i> in <i>oral poetry</i> has come to have an overly narrow meaning, restricted by our own
cultural preconceptions about writing and reading.  We feel the need to define <i>oral</i> in terms of
<i>written</i>:  if something is <i>oral</i>, we tend to assume a conflict with the notion of
<i>written</i>.  From the general standpoint of social anthropology, however, it is <i>written</i> that
has to be defined in terms of <i>oral</i>.  <i>Written</i> is not something that is not <i>oral</i>;
rather it is something in addition to being oral, and that additional something varies from society to
society.
<a href="#s16n1"><sup>1</a><a name="anch16n1"></sup></a>
It is dangerous to universalize the phenomenon of literacy.
<a href="#s16n2"><sup>2</a><a name="anch16n2"></sup></a>
To restate the problem in terms of the distinction between <i>marked</i>
and <i>unmarked:</i>  if we juxtapose <i>oral</i> and <i>written</i>, it is <i>written</i> that
functions as the marked member of the opposition, while <i>oral</i> is unmarked.  The definition of
<i>written</i> is predicated on the given of <i>oral</i>.
<p><a name="s17">&sect;17.</a>   In this book we have ample opportunity to consider the many variations of interaction
between two fundamental
aspects of oral traditions:  composition and performance.
Already at this point, however,  I call attention to a general
tendency in contemporary thinking to undervalue the aspect of
performance by overvaluing the aspect of composition.  In
seeking to put the act of performance into a balanced perspective, I find it
useful to bring into play J. L. Austin's notion of a
performative utterance or <i>speech-act</i>, where the antithesis of
word and action is neutralized, in that the word <i>is</i> the action.
<a href="#s17n1"><sup>1</a><a name="anch17n1"></sup></a>
I invoke also Barbara Johnson's application of Austin's notion of speech-act to <i>poetry</i>-- an
application that Austin resisted--and her insistence on the self-referential quality of the performative:
"The performative, then, acts like a 'shifter' in that it takes on meaning only by referring to the instance of
its
utterance."
<a href="#s17n2"><sup>2</a><a name="anch17n2"></sup></a>
Johnson adds her own translation of Emile Benveniste's formulation:  "An
utterance is performative insofar as it <i>names</i> the act performed....
The utterance <i>is</i> the act; the utterer performs the act by naming it."
<a href="#s17n3"><sup>3</a><a name="anch17n3"></sup></a>
<p><a name="s18">&sect;18.</a> If indeed performance "takes on meaning only by referring to the instance of its utterance," then this
instance, this occasion, must be the basis for the intent of the utterance, for its rhetoric.
<a href="#s18n1"><sup>1</a><a name="anch18n1"></sup></a>
If, further, the occasion should ever be lost or removed, then the intent of the utterance is destabilized.  We
may say that the very notion of genre serves as compensation for the lost occasion.
<a href="#s18n2"><sup>2</a><a name="anch18n2"></sup></a>
<p><a name="s19">&sect;19.</a> I take it, then, that questions of meaning in the composition of a song or poem cannot be settled in terms
of the composition alone:  we must keep in mind what the composition says about its performance or
potential performance, and what that says about whoever is the composer, whoever is the performer.
<a href="#s19n1"><sup>1</a><a name="anch19n1"></sup></a>
Only this way can we begin to do justice to questions of authorship and even of authority.
<a href="#s19n2"><sup>2</a><a name="anch19n2"></sup></a>
<p><a name="s20">&sect;20.</a> What makes words authoritative is the value that the given society attaches to their performance.  And the
authoritativeness of speech is a central issue in this book.  The notion of authoritative speech, as we shall
see, is conveyed in Greek by such key words as <b>ainos</b>.
<a href="#s20n1"><sup>1</a><a name="anch20n1"></sup></a>
<p><a name="s21">&sect;21.</a> Bringing to a close this brief review of technical elements in the book, I take this opportunity to stress
my awareness that there is no one method, no one theory, that could ever suffice for comprehending the
totality of any piece of Greek literature, or of any literature.  This is no excuse, however, for being hostile
to theory, a stance that is perennially fashionable among Classicists.  I agree with Eagleton that "hostility
to theory usually means an opposition to other people's theories and an oblivion of one's own."
<a href="#s21n1"><sup>1</a><a name="anch21n1"></sup></a>
<p><a name="s22">&sect;22.</a> In the end the critic can do no better than to discover and then apply the criteria of those who create, or
better, re-create, the tradition.  I take to heart the reaction of Elroy Bundy to the imperative of
<b>phu&ecirc;</b> 'nature' in the poetry of Pindar:
<a href="#s22n1"><sup>1</a><a name="anch22n1"></sup></a>
<p><a name="s23">&sect;23.</a> Pindar's <font face="Kadmos,Attika,Athenian,Sparta"><a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/morphindex?entry=fua/&display=&display=SMK">fuã</a> </font> [<b>phu&ecirc;</b>] has nothing to do with the natural,
unschooled, unconscious genius of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries,
but denotes schooling by experience in the truth of words and actions in a
living tradition; the [negative concept of] "learning" he speaks of...is mere rote imitation of things not
understood.  You must not, he means, apply systems of method but elicit your method from the thing to
be investigated; do not, armed with a detached system, go in search of a subject, but, having chosen a
subject, refusing to bury it under an avalanche of terms, allow it to reveal the unity in its manifold as you
"draw together the strands of many matters in brief."
<p><a name="s24">&sect;24.</a> The choice of subject in this book is clear.  As the title says, the central concern is not Pindar, but
Pindar's Homer.  What interests me primarily is the relationship of Pindar's tradition to other lyric
traditions and to the epic tradition of Homer.  A major task that I have set for myself is to seek whatever
the epic of Homer really means to Pindar as a master of his own medium of poetry, which is lyric; the
search must engage Pindar's own words, which I hold to be the prime evidence for the independent lyric
tradition that lives on through his art.  In searching for a unified vision of what Homer means to Pindar, I
hope to achieve an insight into a broader literary question, that is, what epic means to lyric.
<a href="#s24n1"><sup>1</a><a name="anch24n1"></sup></a>
Since the unified vision that is sought--what Bundy calls the unity to be revealed--is complex, a
variety of strategies in presentation is needed, and that variety makes it necessary to offer here, for the sake
of clarity, an outline of the chapters that follow.
<p><a name="s25">&sect;25.</a> To begin, Chapter 1 examines the criteria for differentiating oral <i>poetry</i> and <i>song</i> in early
Greek society, as exemplified by the epic of Homer and and the lyric of Pindar, respectively.  The aim is
to set up the concept of <i>lyric poetry</i> or <i>lyric</i> as a default category for those types of song
that are <i>not</i> poetry, in a stricter sense of the word.  Conversely it is argued that the meters known
to us as the hexameter, the elegiac distich, and the iambic trimeter are the formal markers, in the Classical
period, of poetry in this stricter sense, that is, of verse that is not sung.  In contrast lyric typifies what is
sung, what is potentially danced and potentially accompanied by <b>aulos</b> 'reed' or <b>kithar&acirc;</b>
'lyre'.  It is also argued that just as song becomes differentiated into a dichotomy of poetry and song, so
also poetry becomes further differentiated into a dichotomy of prose and poetry.  In the process of arriving
at an understanding of all these differentiations, the meanings of the key words  <b>m&ucirc;thos</b>
'myth' and <b>m&icirc;m&ecirc;sis</b> 'mimesis' are reassessed, while another key word, <b>ainos</b>, is
assigned a working definition, 'speech-act'.
<a href="#s25n1"><sup>1</a><a name="anch25n1"></sup></a>
<p><a name="s26">&sect;26.</a> With reference to the Appendix, Chapter 1 goes on to argue that the three prime meters of poetry in the
Classical period, however distinct the medium of poetry may have become from the medium of song, can
nevertheless be derived from the attested meters of song.  The two major categories of meters that
comprise the song-making traditions of Pindar, the so-called Aeolic and dactylo-epitrite, are shown to
contain the building blocks of the iambic trimeter, the elegiac distich, and even the hexameter.  In this
sense it can even be said that Pindar's inherited meters are the parents of Homer's hexameter, though the
parent in this case has experienced a longer evolution, culminating with Pindar, than the child,
culminating with Homer.
<p><a name="s27">&sect;27.</a> Chapter 2 investigates the general characteristics of oral poetry, as established by the cross cultural
perspective of field work in living traditions, and compares these with the specific characteristics of oral
poetry in the social context of early Greece.  Whereas the two factors of composition and performance are
essential in all oral poetry, with varying degrees of recomposition in performance depending on the form
of poetry and on the given phase of its evolution, the early Greek evidence calls for a third factor to be
taken into account, the factor of diffusion.  The diffusion of early Greek poetry, as exemplified primarily
by Homer, is analyzed in terms of two emerging social patterns in early Greece, culminating in the
institution of the <b>polis</b> 'city-state' and in the correlative impulse of Panhellenism.  These patterns
destabilize the concept of <b>m&ucirc;thos</b> 'myth' and promote an alternative truth value, the
privileged concept of <b>al&ecirc;theia</b> 'truth'.  Also, the factors of diffusion and recomposition in
performance have a profound effect on the very concept of authorship.
<p><a name="s28">&sect;28.</a> Chapter 3 shifts attention to the characteristics of oral song making, as distinct from nonlyric "poetry" in
the stricter sense of the word.  The striking diversity of melodic patterns in early Greek traditions of song
making is examined in terms of chronologically successive but overlapping criteria, deduced from both the
internal evidence of the songs and the available external evidence.  These criteria are reflected in the
technical words <b>nomos</b>, <b>harmoni&acirc;</b>, <b>tonos</b>, and <b>genos</b>.  The progressive
systematization reflected by these words is correlated with the progressive canonization of melodic
patterns, a reflex, it is claimed, of Panhellenization in song-making traditions.  The trend of
Panhellenization also accounts for the emergence of a Classical canon of nine lyric poets, corresponding to
the earlier canons of nonlyric poets.  In the forefront of the "lyric nine" is Pindar.
<p><a name="s29">&sect;29.</a> Chapter 4 offers an introduction to the medium of Pindar, with <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/lookup?lookup=Pind.+O.+1+"><i>Olympian</i>1</a> as the centerpiece.
This composition of Pindar's affords a premier illustration of the victory ode, or epinician, the only lyric
genre to survive from Pindar's vast lyric repertoire as a near-complete corpus.  The choice of
<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/lookup?lookup=Pind.+O.+1+"><i>Olympian</i>1</a> as illustration is specially suited for the book since the central myth of this ode, the
story of Pelops, is connected with the ritual dimension of the Olympic Games, the premier athletic
festival of the ancient Greek world.  It is argued that Pindar's presentation of the Pelops myth, including
his explicit rejection of some details inherited from past versions of the narrative, reflects not his private
invention but rather his public acceptance of the narrative in its then-current version, as formalized in the
mythological and ritual dimensions of a most complex institution, the Olympics.
<p><a name="s30">&sect;30.</a> Chapter 5 connects the ritual dimension of athletics with the ritual dimension of the epinician itself, as
presented in Pindar's own words.  The efforts of the poet, in glorifying the occasion of the athletic event,
are presented by the song as a ritual speech-act that serves as compensation for the efforts culminating in
the athlete's victory, which in turn serve as compensation for the primordial efforts or experiences of
heroes in the heroic age, as glorified by Homer.  All these efforts, of poets, athletes, and heroes, are treated
by the poetry as <i>ordeals</i>, a ritual concept conveyed by words like <b>ag&ocirc;n</b>, shared by Pindar
and Homer.
<p><a name="s31">&sect;31.</a> This topic of a ritual ideology linking athletes, heroes, and poets sets the stage for Chapter 6, an extensive
survey of the relationship between Pindaric song and Homeric poetry.  While Homer's medium of epic
poetry glorifies heroes, Pindar's medium of lyric song glorifies simultaneously the heroes of the past and
the athletes of the present.  By collapsing the distinction between hero and athlete, the epinician of Pindar
becomes a genuine occasion of prestige for the contemporary figure who is being glorified, and this poetic
glorification is correlated with the realities of wealth, power, and prestige in the here and now.  These three
realities of wealth, power, and prestige ultimately preserve the identities of Pindar's patrons.  Conversely
the identity of Pindar is a function of his authority, which is simultaneously the authority of
the epinician, to confer prestige.  The authority of the epinician, as a form of authoritative speech, is
conveyed by the word <b>ainos</b>.
<a href="#s31n1"><sup>1</a><a name="anch31n1"></sup></a>
It is this authority that guarantees the authorship of Pindar.
<p><a name="s32">&sect;32.</a> Chapter 7 concentrates on three different occasions when the world of heroes merges with the world of the
here and now through the authority of the <b>ainos</b>.  The three occasions correspond to three Pindaric
epinicians:  <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/lookup?lookup=Pind.+P.+8"><i>Pythian</i>8</a>, <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/lookup?lookup=Pind.+I.+8"><i>Isthmian</i>8</a>, and <a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/lookup?lookup=Pind.+P.+6"><i>Pythian</i> 6</a>.  Here are three different
compositions enhancing in three different ways the prestige of real people whose prestige or
<b>kleos</b>  'glorification' depends on an ideological merger between the <b>kleos</b> of Pindar's
<b>ainos</b> and the <b>kleos</b> of Homer's epic, the world of heroes.
<p><a name="s33">&sect;33.</a> Chapter 8, resuming the discussion in Chapter 1, takes up the subject of prose, to be explained as one
further stage of differentiation in types of speech-act.  This time, the argument goes, poetry becomes
further differentiated into a dichotomy of prose and poetry, just as song had earlier become differentiated
into a dichotomy of poetry and song.  The prime example of early Greek prose is the discourse of
Herodotus, whose language makes it implicit that he is a <b>logios</b> 'master of speech', a description
that is pertinent to the dichotomy, made explicit in Pindar's language, between <b>logios</b> 'master of
speech' and <b>aoidos</b> 'master of song'.  The prose of Herodotus, like the poetry and song of the
<b>ainos</b>, is a speech-act of authority.  Such authority is parallel to that of Solon, a historical figure
who becomes part of the canonical Seven Sages tradition.  The dramatized words addressed by Solon to
Croesus the Tyrant in Book I of Herodotus are tantamount to an <b>ainos</b> contextualized by the
narrative frame of the <i>Histories</i>.
<p><a name="s34">&sect;34.</a> The very word <b>histori&acirc;</b> 'inquiry, history', used by Herodotean discourse in referring to itself, is
traced in Chapter 9 to the traditions of juridical prose, especially in the context of international (that is,
inter-polis) arbitration.  These traditions of juridical prose are shown to parallel those of sacred juridical
poetry, as exemplified by Hesiod.  There are parallels between the moral message of such discourse and the
moral message of the <b>ainos</b>, as exemplified by the poetry of Theognis and the song making of
Pindar.  Herodotean prose reveals its affinities with the <b>ainos</b> of poetry and song in its
deployment of the word <b>s&ecirc;main&ocirc;</b> 'indicate', derivative of <b>s&ecirc;ma</b> 'sign, tomb of a hero'.
<p><a name="s35">&sect;35.</a> In Chapter 10 the parallelism between modes of discourse in Pindar and Herodotus is explored further, with
the theme of Croesus the Tyrant as a test case.  Special attention is given to what is traditionally left
unsaid in such a theme, reflecting as it does the diplomatic stance of the <b>ainos</b>, where implicit
warning is an aspect of explicit praise.  It becomes clear that the theme of Croesus the Tyrant is pertinent
to the actual occasion of epinicians, to the here and now of Pindar's contemporaries who commissioned
him to compose
songs to enhance their prestige.  Since the diplomatic format of the <b>ainos</b> allows implicit
warning in the context of explicit praise, the very trappings of a tyrant can be acknowledged as powerfully
attractive, without any diminution of the moral impact in the overall message.  Tyranny has its charms.
It also becomes clear that the figure of the tyrant, overtly alien to Hellenic ways, is intended by the
<b>ainos</b> as a latent reflection of what is native.  The explicit other is the implicit self.  This theme
of "alien is native," which has its origins in the straightforward ethnocentric tendency of appropriating
what is foreign as a form of self-reassurance for the community, can thus be turned into a form of
warning:  if what you want to find from the outside is already available on the inside, then perhaps
whatever you want to prevent from the outside has already emerged from within.  This moral message
is relentlessly persistent in the prose narrative of Herodotus, as if in an <b>ainos</b>.
<p><a name="s36">&sect;36.</a> Chapter 11 shows that the parallelism between the messages in the prose of Herodotus and the lyric poetry
of Pindar can best be observed in situations where Herodotus quotes or paraphrases poetry, particularly the
nonlyric poetry of oracular utterances.  Similar patterns of quoting or paraphrasing poetry can be found in
the <i>Lives of the Seven Sages</i> tradition, as typified by the <i>Life of Solon</i> tradition.  In the
Herodotean sequences of prose and poetry, the train of thought matches the train of thought in Pindaric
sequences of uninterrupted lyric poetry.  In other words the framing of poetry by prose in Herodotus
matches the continuum of lyric poetry in Pindar.  Thus the <b>logios</b> 'master of speech' conveys
<b>ainos</b> indirectly by framing poetry while the <b>aoidos</b> 'master of song' conveys it directly.
This chapter brings to a close the comparison, ongoing since Chapter 9, of Pindar and Herodotus.  The
final point of emphasis is the sheer variety of poetic traditions, both nonlyric and lyric, that is quoted or
cited by Herodotus.  For Herodotus, the general category of poetry can accommodate even the
<i>Fables</i> of Aesop and the <i>Seven Sages</i> tradition.  What makes Herodotus a particularly rich
resource for understanding the fullest possible range of fifth-century traditions in poetry and song is that he
makes the themes of poetry and song a part of his own repertoire of composition and even of organization.
<p><a name="s37">&sect;37.</a> Chapter 12 takes another look at the actual authority of the epinician in the larger context of the social
function of the <b>khoros</b> 'song-and-dance ensemble, chorus' in the polis.  It is argued that the
chorus is the ultimate mimesis of authority in early Greek society, and that the very concept of authorship
is ultimately defined by choral authority.  In this light the argument is repeated that Archaic Greek poetry
is the result of a differentiation of monodic song, which in turn had become differentiated from choral song
and dance.
<p><a name="s38">&sect;38.</a> Chapter 13 confronts the major historical phenomenon that stands between us and the vast repertoire of
poetic traditions available to Herodotus and exemplified by Pindar.  That phenomenon is the evolution of
Athenian State Theater, pioneered by tyrants and perfected by the democracy.  State
Theater appropriated the repertoire of older poetic traditions and transformed it, in a vast and ongoing
synthesis described by Plato as "theatrocracy."  It is argued that the evolution of democratic poetics in
Athenian State Theater is analogous, albeit on a much more complex level, to the evolution of
aristocratic poetics in the choral medium of Pindar and even in the nonchoral medium of a figure like
Archilochus.  As the focus shifts to the later phases of the democracy in Athens, it becomes clear that the
old-fashioned repertoire represented by the likes of Pindar could still survive in the context of monodic
reperformances at symposia.  Also the Classics of the old masters were still being taught in private
schools.  Nevertheless, the domain of public choral performance had become the primary domain of State
Theater.  The poets of State Theater, such as Aristophanes, could still express nostalgia for the more
aristocratic choral medium of Pindar and even borrow from it, either directly or in parody, but the
audiences at Athens were ultimately theirs, not Pindar's.  Yet the lyric poetry of Pindar survived, because
it became a textbook for those inner circles that wanted to perpetuate an old-fashioned and aristocratic
choral medium of composition and performance.  Pindar's actual <i>medium</i> of performance
ultimately did not survive, but his words did, thanks to another kind of medium, what I have just described
as the textbook.  Pindar's aristocratic medium of performance, even down to its last attested phases of
extinction, was ever redolent of potential or real tyrants, the sort of social circles that had indeed once upon
a time reshaped this medium by dint of their authority in the glory days of Pindar's prime.
<p><a name="s39">&sect;39.</a> This point leads finally to Chapter 14, a retrospective summary of the relationship between the lyric
heritage of Pindaric song and the epic heritage of Homeric poetry.  For the Pindaric tradition, it is clear
that Homer is the representative of all epic, not just the <i>Iliad</i> and <i>Odyssey</i>.  For Pindar,
the epic repertoire of Homer can be freely generated from his own inherited lyric repertoire, much as we
can derive the Homeric hexameter from the inherited building-blocks of Pindar's meters.  Whatever the
merits of Homer, he is always held up as a foil for Pindar's own artistry.
<p><a name="s40">&sect;40.</a> In ending my summary of the book on this particular note, which sets the tone for beginning the
exposition in detail, I can do no better than quote Pindar himself on the tales of heroes told by Homer:

Pindar is following in the path of epic with his own epinician themes.  An expert in the art of Pindar
writes about this passage:

'premeditation' refers to his own craft or training ground; <b>to...par podi</b> '[the wave] nearest the

All of which "draws together the strands of many matters in brief."

<a href="#anch13n1"><b>&sect;13n1</b></a><a name="s13n1">.</a> To quote his own words:  "Quand &agrave; la suite d'une transformation
morphologique une forme subit la diff&eacute;rentiation, la forme nouvelle
correspond &agrave; sa fonction primaire (de fondation), la forme ancienne est
r&eacute;serv&eacute;e pour la fonction secondaire (fond&eacute;e)" (Kurylowicz
[1966] 169).  By older form I mean simply the form that is <i>already</i>
assigned to a given function, whereas by newer form I mean the form
that is <i>about to be</i> assigned.  As an example, I cite English <i>quick</i>, cognate of Latin
u&icirc;uos 'alive': <i>quick</i> was ousted from the sphere of meaning 'living, alive', becoming
semantically specialized in the sense of 'lively' and, eventually, 'quick' (the older meaning is still evident
in such fossils as <i>the quick and the dead</i>, or <i>bite the nails to the quick</i>).  Kurylowicz's
fourth law is pertinent to the following formulation of Bakhtin [1984] 410:  "The object that has been
destroyed remains in the world but in a new form of being in time and space; it becomes the 'other side' of
the new object that has taken its place."  There are of course patterns of development that may be described
as alternatives to Kurylowicz's fourth law.  For one,  there will be situations where the competition
between newer and older forms leads to the ousting of the older form by the newer form altogether.  Or
else the newer and older forms may achieve coexistence in a suppletive relationship (as in Latin fer&ocirc;/
ferre / tul&icirc; / l&acirc;tus, where the first two principal 
parts are "older," while the second two are "newer";
similarly in toll&ocirc;, tollere, sustul&icirc;,
subl&acirc;tus) or as morphophonemic variants  (on which see

<a href="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/lookup?lookup=Eur.+IT+435"><i>Iphigeneia in Tauris</i> 435</a>).  Given that Itsumi has collected some 400 attestations of the
choriambic dimeter in the corpus of Euripides (p. 61), and that he can point to only two examples where
the pattern _oo_ occurs in the first half, I find that his own statistical findings reinforce my observation
that the pattern _oo_ is traditionally avoided in the first half of the choriambic dimeter.  Moreover, Itsumi
himself stresses that Euripides is in many respects an innovator in his use of the choriambic dimeter (e.g.,
p. 72).  Since he can cite no exceptions to the pattern of avoiding _oo_  in the first half of choriambic
dimeter in Archaic Greek metrics and a strikingly low percentage of exceptions in the more innovative
metrics of Euripides, I fail to see the validity of his disagreement (p. 60) with the formulation offered in N
1974.37, where I say that "the opening of the choriambic dimeter must be free, and therefore it is not
allowed to be a choriamb itself."  Also, it is misleading for Itsumi to say that the first half of choriambic
dimeter "should not be regarded as a separate component" since it "does not appear in isolation" (p. 69).  A
comparative analysis of the available metrical evidence, as in the discussion at N, pp. 37-38,  is not
predicated on the notion that the first half of choriambic dimeter is a "separate component." It is a
component, yes, but not a separate component.<p>
<a href="#anch15n4"><b>&sect;15n4</b></a><a name="s15n4">.</a>   This interpretation differs from the approach of Itsumi 1982 to the choriambic dimeter.
He assumes that rhythmical freedom in the first half of the choriambic dimeter can be posited only if we
find every possible combination of long and short quantities there.  No such assumption is necessary
since the freedom of the first half is already
assured by the simple fact of variability in its rhythmical patterns, as
opposed to the invariability of the patterns in the second half.  Even if the
third of the first four syllables in attested choriambic dimeters is regularly long (Itsumi, p. 60), the variety
of patterns in the first, second, and fourth syllables still constitutes a sector of variability in the entire first
half of choriambic dimeter, as opposed to a sector of invariability in the second half.  There is a symmetry
in the opposition between a variable opening half and an invariable closing half.  I recommend a close
reading of Allen 1973.106, with its enhanced perspective of comparative evidence on the topic of
interaction between rhythmically flexible openings and rigid closings in metrical units, as a counterweight
to the limitations imposed by Itsumi's strictly descriptivist interpretations of available metrical data.  On
the general tendency of maintaining a tension between ideal and actual patterns at the beginning of the line
and of solving this tension at the end of the line, see Allen, p. 110.  Cf. also  <a href="appendix.html#s11">Appendix &sect;11</a>.  Moreover,
the notion that an initial pattern of xx_o in choriambic dimeter precedes the pattern xx_x historically
(Itsumi, p. 71) seems to me counterintuitive from the standpoint of comparative metrics.  I also disagree
with the notion that the choriambic dimeter may have been "created" by way of changes in the glyconic
(ibid.); cf.  <a href="appendix.html#s10">Appendix &sect;10</a>.<p>

<a href="#anch24n1"><b>&sect;24n1</b></a><a name="s24n1">.</a> For exemplary works on Homeric references in Pindar, where the emphasis is not so much on the
independence of Pindar's lyric tradition as on the independence of Pindar himself as an individual poet, see,
for example, Race 1986.58-62 and Pelliccia 1987.  Cf. also Nisetich 1989; at pp. 1-5 he offers a survey of
works that address the question of Homer's influence on Pindar, e.g. Fitch 1924, Young 1968, Stoneman
1981.  I object, however, to the remark in Nisetich, pp. 4-5:  "The transformation of Arctinus' Leuce into
Pindar's Island of the Blest necessarily escapes notice if we insist on treating the one as if it were the
equivalent of the other." As a case in point he refers to N 1979.167, 207, among other discussions.  This
is to misconstrue what was being analyzed in those pages.  I was not treating one myth as if it were the
"equivalent" of another:  rather, I was comparing variant myths that are cognate with each other.  To argue
that given variants are cognates is a far cry from treating one myth as if it were the equivalent of another
and failing to notice differences.  The very concept of variation, of multiformity in myth making, requires
the recognition of differences as well as similarities between traditional patterns.  The existence of
multiforms in myth, however, leads to serious methodological difficulties.  I cite N, pp. 42-43, for
example, where I discuss the pitfalls of trying to establish an "Ur-form" on the basis of multiforms in a
given tradition.  To assume that variation results merely from multiple instances of personal artistic
creation, as implied for example by Nisetich's reference to "Arctinus' Leuce," is to risk the slighting of
tradition itself as a vital component of the creative process in Archaic Greek poetry.  I fail to see why
Nisetich thinks that anyone would have a problem with the idea of "transformation" in comparing one
version with another.  The real problem is:  to what extent is tradition involved in such transformation?
