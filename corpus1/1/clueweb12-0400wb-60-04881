<p class=MsoNormal>            In recent attempts to assuage our guilt as an
ever-growing (in the literal sense) population of sedentary and obese individuals,
much research has been conducted into the health benefits of foods popularly
viewed as “saboteurs” of various weight loss efforts.  Chocolate is a food that
many people engage in a love/hate relationship with. Its popularity as an
aphrodisiac is well-known and it is a delicious ingredient in nearly every
dessert choice we may face.  It is a source of comfort in stressful times as
the sinfully sweet goodness melts in your mouth in the form of rich dark
chocolate cake, a bowl of chocolate ice cream, or a pan of fresh baked, ooey-gooey,
warm brownies.  After its consumption, however, it often can be the cause of
immense guilt.  Well-known to be loaded with saturated fats and calories, the
psychological anguish is tantamount to the physical damages one can incur from
indulging too often.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            But recent claims seem to indicate that there
may yet be hope for all the suffering “chocoholics” that just can’t seem to get
enough of the delectable dessert. It has been proposed that dark chocolate may
produce the same cardiovascular health benefits previously ascribed only to
sickeningly “good-for-you” staples such as blueberries, various veggies, and
recently, wine and green tea.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            </b>Researchers today aren’t the first to
claim cardiovascular benefits can be produced by chocolate consumption. In the
17<sup>th</sup> century, chocolate was popularly thought to strengthen the
heart and was used to treat heart problems. (Steinberg et al, 2003) Today, that
claim is being made again by companies and researchers alike.  Of course – for the
sake of our consciences – we are biased to believe that chocolate really does
have miracle ingredients that contribute to cardiovascular health, but how
accurate are the claims?  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Bradley Hand ITC"'>A
Clever Marketing Campaign:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The belief that dark chocolate actually has
health benefits has led to the development of companies that cater specifically
to a population trying to lead a healthy lifestyle without giving up the
occasional indulgence in their favorite sweets.  CocoaVia is one such brand. <a
href="http://www.cocoavia.com/story/">http://www.cocoavia.com/story/</a>  Cocoa
Via Brand Heart Healthy Snacks are so confident in the health benefits of dark
chocolate, that they include the claim in their name.  CocoaVia guarantees that
their snacks have 100 mg of naturally occurring cocoa flavonols, “like those
found in red wine in green tea.”  Dark chocolate supposedly helps blood flow by
allowing blood vessel walls to relax and promotes healthy platelet activity
which aids in maintenance of healthy circulation and blood vessels.  The
benefits don’t end there though! Vascular health is promoted by decreasing the
oxidation of LDL cholesterol (that’s the bad kind) which is believed to
decrease the likelihood of formation of plaque in the arteries.  So how
accurate are these claims about the protective powers of dark chocolate?</p>

<p>            The Xocai company also touts the benefits of “healthy
chocolate.”  This company claims that chocolate consumption increases energy
levels and provides “a sense of overall health and wellbeing like never
before.”  Their main appeal is to the rejection of popular “restrictive
dieting” methods that frustrate many dieters. This company combines chocolate
with other ingredients, such as Acai, that also are thought to have health
benefits.  <a href="http://www.whyxocai.com/product.html">http://www.whyxocai.com/product.html</a>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            It almost sounds too good to be true. Chocolate
is a heart healthy part of your diet? Comparable to apples, blueberries,
cheerios, and other antioxidant rich foods?  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Bradley Hand ITC"'>What
the Science says:</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Science has quite a bit to say on the cardiovascular
benefits of dark chocolate.  Steinberg and colleagues drew upon the research of
123 studies on the subject in their 2003 paper, <i>Cocoa</i><i> and chocolate
flavonoids: Implications for Cardiovascular Health</i>. Dark chocolate derived
from the plant <i>Theobroma cacao</i> is thought to provide its health benefits
with its high antioxidant content.  Dark chocolate, if processed correctly,
retains more of the natural cacao bean than other types, such as milk
chocolate.  This makes dark chocolate a rich source of flavonoids, specifically
the flavonoids catechin, epicatechin, and procyanidins.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Bradley Hand ITC"'>Flavonoids
– what are they and what do they have to do with cardiovascular health?</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Flavonoids can be found in fruits, veggies,
wine, tea and cacao (to name a few sources).  Their chemical structure
indicates that flavonoids have antioxidant capacity which makes them capable of
scavenging harmful free radicals in our blood stream.  Flavonoids are extremely
beneficial to cardiovascular health.  They help to keep cholesterol from
gathering in the blood vessels, inhibit the immune responses that may lead to
clogged arteries, and reduce platelet reactivity which reduces the risk of
blood clots.  Once flavonoid containing foods are consumed, they are acted upon
by enzymes and show up as different metabolites in the blood stream. One such
metabolite that is rapidly absorbed by humans is Epicatechin. The concentration
of epicatechin in the blood can be used to determine the amount of flavonoids
that were consumed and then predict the potential health benefits based on that
knowledge. Ideally, a food will produce a high concentration of these
metabolites if it contains flavonoids that could increase cardiovascular
health.  It has been found that the concentration of epicatechin from dark
chocolate is in the same range produced by consuming onions, apples, and tea.
Sounds pretty good! So if flavonoids are found in dark chocolate, why not grab
some dark chocolate instead of an apple next time you’re hungry?  Read on…</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Bradley Hand ITC"'>The
Evidence Grows</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            A more recent study on the cardiovascular health
benefits of dark chocolate was conducted in 2004 by Mary Engler and her colleagues
at the University of California, San Francisco.  This study wanted to test
previous studies’ results that indicated that cacao flavonoids had antioxidant
properties and inhibited platelet activity, both of which have positive effects
on overall cardiovascular health.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            <i>Subjects and Procedure –</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            This study used 22 volunteers between the ages
of 21 and 55 who were deemed in good health at the beginning of the study.  The
study was randomized, double-blind (meaning both the subjects and researchers
were unaware which group, control or experimental, they were in) and took place
in a two-week time period.  The subjects either were instructed eat a piece of
high-flavonoid or low flavonoid dark chocolate daily.  Other instructions were
to maintain their usual level of physical activity, keep a food diary, and
refrain from flavonoid-rich foods and beverages on a provided list.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><i>            Results –</i></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                                                                                                </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>                  The subjects that were given the
high-flavonoid dark chocolate were found to have a significant increase in the
concentration of plasma epicatechin compared to the subjects in the
low-flavonoid group, which, as discussed before, indicates increased benefits
for the cardiovascular system in the form of better blood flow in the arteries
which is good for your heart.  This study also found that increased epicatechin
concentration levels are associated with improved endothelium-dependent
vasodilation, which is a fancy way of saying that blood vessels dilate and
relax in a healthy way.  Stiffness of blood vessels can lead to diseased blood
vessels, so the ability to relax is key to maintaining cardiovascular health. 
Ingesting dark chocolate rich in flavonoids produces important protective
benefits for the cardiovascular system.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Many studies have been done investigating the
potential cardiovascular benefits of cocoa and we only look at a few of them
in-depth here.  Two more worth mentioning further strengthen the claim that
there are indeed health benefits to be gained from indulging in a diet that
includes cocoa.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The first study, conducted by Taubert, Roesen,
Lehmann, Jung, and Schomig in 2007 had a set-up similar to that of Engler’s
study that was just outlined. Participants received either flavonoid rich dark
chocolate or a comparable amount of white chocolate lacking the flavonoids
believed to be beneficial.  However, the participants in this study all had
upper-range prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension and were currently
untreated for this. The researchers wanted to test the effects of dark chocolate
on the blood pressure of the participants.  The participants ate the chocolate
for 18 weeks and then their baseline blood pressure at the start of the study
was compared with their end blood pressure after the 18 weeks.  Their results
again confirm what the previous studies have found: dark chocolate intake
reduced both systolic and diastolic blood pressure in participants assigned to
that group and Hypertension prevalence declined from 86% down to 68%. White
chocolate, however, caused no changes in blood pressure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Another interesting study worth mentioning is a
long-term observational study that examined the relationship between cocoa
intake and blood pressure but then also did follow ups to see if cocoa intake
was prospectively related to cardiovascular mortality. The Zutphen Elderly
Study is different from the short-term intervention studies we have discussed.
It is an observational study – meaning that no one’s diets were manipulated,
merely observed over time to see if there was a relationship between the amount
of cocoa one consumed and their health.  Data was collected from 470 elderly
men.  First, relationship between cocoa and blood pressure was analyzed
cross-sectionally using baseline blood pressure and blood pressure after five
years and comparing this to their estimated cocoa intake as assessed by
checking their self-reported dietary history.  It was found that average systolic
and diastolic blood pressure was lower among the men consuming the most cocoa.
This implies, once again, a correlation between cocoa consumption and lower
blood pressure.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            In order to determine if cocoa could be a
protective factor against cardiovascular mortality, a prospective analysis was
done.  Overall, 314 men in the study died, 152 of cardiovascular disease.  Assessing
these individuals’ food records from the 15 years they were in the study could
determine if indeed their cocoa intake had been lower than those who were still
living or those who died of other causes. It was found that cocoa intake is
inversely associated with cardiovascular mortality.  Regular cocoa intake was
found to lower risk of cardiovascular and all-cause death by 45%-50%.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            However, many limitations exist in an
observational study that need to be pointed out. There is a strong possibility of
confounding variables – chocolate intake could be related to another variable
that could be the real cause of lower blood pressure or cardiovascular
mortality. Possible confounds might be physical activity and dietary factors. 
The study also may be limited in its generalizability since all participants
were elderly males.  Even though this study has its limitations, it can be
strengthened by further observational and experimental studies and therefore is
valuable because it points us in a direction for future research in this area. 
It seems to indicate that long-term daily intake of small amounts of cocoa may
lower blood pressure and decrease risk of cardiovascular mortality.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Bradley Hand ITC"'>Helps
not only the healthy…</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b>            </b>So what if you are an individual already
suffering from a cardiovascular disease? With the 2004 stats reporting that
79,400,000 Americans have one or more forms of cardiovascular disease, this is
a question many may be asking (Cardiovascular Disease Statistics, AHA).  Never
fear! It isn’t too late to turn your health around by also engaging in the dark
chocolate trend. Taking a new spin on the dark chocolate question, the American
Heart Association recently funded a study that looked at individuals suffering
from Hypertension (high blood pressure) and the effects of dark chocolate on
their blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and also vasodilation of the blood
vessels.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The subjects of the study were 10 men and 10
women with essential hypertension who had never previously been treated for
their disease. They first went through a 7-day phase that excluded all cocoa
foods.  At the end of this phase, they were randomly assigned to receive either
a 100-g dark chocolate bar or a 90-g white chocolate bar for the next 15 days.
Both bars had the same amount of calories (480) and similar amounts of cocoa
butter, fiber, electrolytes, macronutrients, and vitamins so that the only
thing significantly differing between the two was the flavonoid content.  After
15 days, the subjects again went through a 7-day cocoa free phase before being
switched so that the group previously consuming the dark chocolate now ate
white chocolate and vice versa. They ate their novel chocolate for 15 more
days.  Throughout the entire process, they kept food diaries and controlled
their weights by substituting the chocolate bars for similar energy-dense
foods.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The results are very promising.  Overall, the
subjects experienced the most benefits when consuming flavonal-rich dark
chocolate. It decreased blood pressure, improved LDL/HDL cholesterol ratios and
improved endothelial vasodilation.  Data was collected after each 15-day
chocolate phase.  Blood pressure decreased in the dark chocolate subjects, but
remained consistently high for those consuming white chocolate.  As for
cholesterol, another important component of overall cardiovascular health,
total cholesterol levels went down for the dark chocolate group and remained
constant for the white chocolate group. What is also interesting to note is
that total LDL cholesterol levels (what is commonly referred to as “bad”
cholesterol) also decreased in the dark chocolate group and didn’t change for
those eating white chocolate. This means that not only did entire cholesterol
go down for those eating dark chocolate, but the ratio between their “good” HDL
cholesterol and “bad” LDL cholesterol also improved since the HDL cholesterol
remained unchanged in either group. Vasodilation was also found to improve
allowing more blood flow and contributing to the decreased blood pressure
results in those consuming dark chocolate. The same was not found for white
chocolate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;font-family:"Bradley Hand ITC"'>Less
is More!</span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            Even though many studies indicate the benefits
of flavonoid-rich dark chocolate, not enough research exists to form any sort
of dosage that could be recommended by public health providers that would
provide maximum benefit to an individual.  The best advice at this time is to
consume a variety of flavonoid containing foods, such as fruits, veggies, and
beverages as an integral part of a diet that promotes cardiovascular health. 
Including dark chocolate in <i>moderate amounts</i> gives dieters increases
options for concerned dieters and may aid them in sticking to a diet longer if
they feel they are not giving up their favorite sweets.  It must be remembered
though that dark chocolate, in addition to its heart healthy flavonoids, is
also very energy dense compared to other flavonoid containing foods.  Its high
fat and calorie content is certainly a concern for those struggling with
cardiovascular disease and should be considered when making dark chocolate a
part of your diet. Also- the chocolate used in many of these studies has a much
higher flavanol content than many dark chocolates you might pick up from your
supermarket. As was mentioned earlier, flavonoids may be lost in the processing
of the cacao beans which would make these chocolates incapable of producing the
same benefits found in these studies. As chocolate companies become aware of
the health benefits produced by careful processing, more and more are taking
steps to ensure they can indeed boast that their chocolate is “heart healthy.” 
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>            The best advice to take away from this is that
dark chocolate, in moderation, is a very good source of heart healthy
flavonoids and can lead to many health benefits. It should be only one source
of these flavonoids and part of a very diverse, healthy diet that includes
fruits and veggies and a lifestyle that includes regular exercise. 
Cardiovascular health is influenced by many factors, only one of which is the
amount of dark chocolate you consume! </p>
