          <h1>Will the Zero Percent Capital Gains Tax Rate Help You?</h1>

<h3>Tree Farmer Magazine: January/February 2008 - Volume 27 No. 1</h3>

  <hr />
  <p>Note: Example 4 as published was incorrect in Tree Farmer Magazine. The correct  calculations are used below.</p>
  <p><u>Example 4 currently reads:</u></p>
  <p>Assume the same facts as in Example 3, but the Jones have  $12,000 of qualified dividends in addition to the $24,000 capital gain. The  total amount taxed at a maximum rate of 15% is now $36,000. The first $1,000 is  still taxed at the 0% rate and the balance of $35,000 is taxed at 15%, making  the tax $5,250.
   </p>

  <p><u>Example 4 should read:</u></p>
  <p>Assume the same facts as in Example 3, but the Jones have  $12,000 of qualified dividends in addition to the $24,000 capital gain. The  total amount taxed at a maximum rate of 15% is now $36,000. The first $23,000 ($65,100-$42,100) is  still taxed at the 0% rate and the balance of $13,000 is taxed at 15%, making  the tax $1,950 on the timber capital gains and qualified dividends. Note that no distinction is made as to whether it's the qualified dividends or the timber gain to which the 0% capital gains rate applies.</p>
  <hr />
  <p>A zero percent tax rate of will  replace the 5 percent rate for capital gains realized after December 31, 2007. The  zero percent rate applies to gains through the end of 2010, assuming Congress  doesn't change the law between now and then. Let's see if you will benefit from  this change. This explanation will get convoluted, but I'm certain you'd expect  nothing less from the efforts of Congress to "simplify" the tax code.</p>
  <p>The tax  rates on both ordinary income and capital gains are indexed with the rates  increasing with both kinds of income. The capital gains rate is tied to the  ordinary income rate which is tied to the level of your ordinary income. So the  starting point is the amount of your ordinary income, which includes salary,  wages, business income, non-qualified dividends, and taxable interest, among  others. I'll demonstrate this point using the numbers for a married couple  filing a joint tax return for the 2008 tax year, Example 1.</p>
  <p>Example 1. The salaries of Mr. and Mrs. Jones total $85,000  in 2008. Their additional income from interest and investments total $15,000.  They take the standard deduction of $10,900, and two personal exemptions of  $3,500 each. This makes their taxable income $82,100 and their tax liability is  $13,213. But, we need to look at their marginal tax rate. Here's the break down  for their tax liability. The first $16,500 of taxable income is taxed at 10% -  $1,650. The next $49,050 is taxed at 15% - $7,357.50. The remaining $17,000 of  taxable income is taxed at 25% - $4,250. Adding the tax for the three brackets:  $1,650 + $7,358 + $4,250 gives the $13,258 tax due. The average tax rate on their  gross income of $100,000 is 13.2%, but their marginal tax rate is 25%. The 25%  rate applied to the last $17,000 of taxable income. The next higher tax rate of  28% starts when taxable income reaches $131,450.</p>
  <p>Understanding  the ordinary income tax brackets and rates allows us to deal with the capital  gains tax rates. Keeping in mind that the two lowest tax brackets for ordinary  income are 10% and 15%, the 0% capital gains rate applies when your taxable  income with capital gains excluded puts you in the 10% or 15% tax brackets. For  2008 this means that if your taxable income without capital gains is more than  $65,100 no part of your capital gains would be subject to the 0% capital gains.  In this case the capital gains tax rate is a straight 15%, making the average  and marginal capital gains rates the same, as demonstrated in Example 2.</p>
  <p>Example 2. Assume that the Jones in Example 1 also have a  net long-term capital gain of $24,000 from a timber sale. Since their marginal  ordinary income tax rate is 25%, above the 15% bracket, the applicable capital  gains rate is 15%, making the tax on the timber $3,600.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The 0% rate  applies if taxable income excluding capital gains is less than $65,100 as  demonstrated in Example 3.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Example 3. Assume that the Jones taxable income with the  $24,000 of capital gain excluded is only $42,100. This puts them in the 15%  ordinary income tax bracket. An additional $23,000 of income is needed to move  them to the next highest bracket. Thus, the first $23,000 of capital gains is  taxed at the 0% rate and the balance of $1,000 is taxed at the maximum capital  gains rate of 15%. This makes the capital gains tax $150 on the $24,000, for an  average tax rate of 0.625%.</p>
  <p>Qualified  dividends also affects your marginal capital gains tax rate,. You know the  amount of your qualified dividends because they are listed separately on the  Form 1099's sent by payers. The impact is demonstrated by adding qualified  dividends to the facts in Example 3, demonstrated in Example 4.</p>
  <p>Example 4. Assume  the same facts as in Example 3, but the Jones have $12,000 of qualified  dividends in addition to the $24,000 capital gain. The total amount taxed at a  maximum rate of 15% is now $36,000. The first $23,000 ($65,100-$42,100) is  still taxed at the 0% rate and the balance of $13,000 is taxed at 15%, making  the tax $1,950 on the capital gains and qualified dividends. Note that no  distinction is made as to whether it's the qualified dividends or the timber  gain to which the 0% capital gains rate applies.</p>
  <p>Here's how  you can estimate if you will benefit from the 0% rate based on your filing  status.</p>
  <p>A. Estimate your taxable income without capital gains and  qualified dividends.<br />
    B. Determine the upper limit of the 15% ordinary income tax  bracket for your filing status in 2008:<br />
 </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Married  filing jointly - $65,100<br />
      Unmarried -  $32,550<br />
      Married  filing separately - $32,550<br />
      Head of  Household &ndash; $43,650<br />
   </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>C. Estimate the total amount of your capital gains and  qualified dividends<br />
    D. If the amount A exceeds the amount B, C is taxed at 15%  rate. OR,<br />
    E. If the amount A is less than the amount B, subtract A  from B and call this amount E. E is taxed at the 0% rate. Then subtract E from  C and this amount is taxed at 15%.
   </p>
 </p>
  <p><strong>Remember to Use Form T</strong></p>
  <p>On behalf  of the IRS I'm reminding you to use Form T &ndash; Forest Activities Schedule with  the caveat that using it and attaching it to your filed tax return are separate  decisions. You should always complete Form T for any transaction to which it  applies and keep the form and associated supporting documents in your files.  You only have to file Form T with your tax return, however, if your timber  activity constitutes a business. For this purpose, making more than one or two timber  sales every three or four years constitutes a business.</p>
  <p>Assuming  your activities constitute a business as determined by the number and frequency  of timber sales, you need to complete and attach Form T to your return only if  you: (1) Claim a deduction for depletion of cut timber, or the allowable basis  of timber disposed of on the stump under section 631(b); (2) Elect under  section 631(a) to treat the cutting of timber as a sale or exchange; or (3)  Make an outright sale of timber under section 631(b), i.e. timber held for use  in a trade or business, or primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary  course of a trade or business.</p>
  <p>When you  originally acquire timberland you use Form T, Part I &ndash; Acquisitions to show how  you allocated the total original basis to each asset, including each  merchantable timber account, and each premerchantable timber account. Once  these timber accounts are established you use a separate Form T, Part II &ndash;  Timber Depletion for each merchantable timber account. For your reforestation  projects you need to track each qualified timber property (QTP) separately on  Form T, Part IV &ndash; Reforestation and Timber Stand Activities. If you use the  reforestation deduction and amortization provisions most likely you will not  carry a positive balance in these QTP accounts, but if you do then as under  previous law this balance is transferred to a merchantable timber account when  the trees on the QTP reach the merchantable size class. </p>
