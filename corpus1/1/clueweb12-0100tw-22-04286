At first I was afraid<br />
I was petrified<br />
Kept thinking I could never live<br />
without you by my side<br />
But then I spent so many nights<br />
thinking how you did me wrong<br />
And I grew strong<br />
And I learned how to get along<br />
and so you're back<br />
from outer space<br />
I just walked in to find you here<br />
with that sad look upon your face<br />
I should have changed that stupid lock<br />
I should have made you leave your key<br />
If I had known for just one second<br />
you'd be back to bother me<br />
<br />
Go on now go walk out the door<br />
just turn around now<br />
'cause you're not welcome anymore<br />
weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye<br />
Did you think I'd crumble<br />
Did you think I'd lay down and die<br />
Oh no, not I<br />
I will survive<br />
Oh as long as i know how to love<br />
I know I will stay alive<br />
I've got all my life to live<br />
I've got all my love to give<br />
and I'll survive<br />
I will survive (hey-hey)<br />
<br />
[I Will Survive lyrics on http://www.metrolyrics.com]<br />
<br />
It took all the strength I had<br />
not to fall apart<br />
kept trying hard to mend<br />
the pieces of my broken heart<br />
and I spent oh so many nights<br />
just feeling sorry for myself<br />
I used to cry<br />
But now I hold my head up high<br />
and you see me<br />
somebody new<br />
I'm not that chained up little person<br />
still in love with you<br />
and so you felt like dropping in<br />
and just expect me to be free<br />
and now I'm saving all my loving<br />
for someone who's loving me<br />
<br />
Go on now go walk out the door<br />
just turn around now<br />
'cause you're not welcome anymore<br />
weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye<br />
Did you think I'd crumble<br />
Did you think I'd lay down and die<br />
Oh no, not I<br />
I will survive<br />
Oh as long as i know how to love<br />
I know I will stay alive<br />
I've got all my life to live<br />
I've got all my love to give<br />
and I'll survive<br />
I will survive<br />
