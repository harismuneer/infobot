<I>It is the lot of the successful medical practitioner, who more 
occupied with discerning diseases and curing them, than with 
discoursing about their essence, and arranging them into systems, who 
observes and reflects in order to act rather than to speak - it is the 
lot of such men to be invaluable when alive, and to be forgotten soon 
after they are dead; and this is not altogether or chiefly from any 
special ingratitude or injustice on the part of mankind; but from the 
very nature of the case.  Much that made such a man what the community 
to their highest profit found him to be, dies, must die, with him.</I>
