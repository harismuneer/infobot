Fifth Grade - American History - Overview - March
<P>The Civil War is the theme of American History in March. There are five
lessons and an assessment in the unit. Lessons 24 to 26 describe some events
that led to The Civil War. Lessons 27 and 28 deal with two early battles
of the war. Lesson 24, "Toward The Civil War (Part 1)" discusses two causes
of The Civil War, the differences between the industrial North and the
agricultural South and the issue of paid labor in the North versus slave
labor in the South. Lesson 25, "Toward The Civil War (Part 2)" discusses
two additional causes of The Civil War, the issue of slavery and the issue
of states' rights. In Lesson 26, "Toward The Civil War (Part 3)" the focus
is on Lincoln's election as president and how this pushed South Carolina
and other Southern states to secede. Lesson 27, "The Civil War (Part 1)"
discusses Confederate President Jefferson Davis and the attack on Fort
Sumter. Lesson 28, "The Civil War (Part 2)" describes the First Battle
of Bull Run also known as the Battle of Manassas. The assessment relates
to all five lessons in the unit. The lesson or lessons which the activities
relate to are indicated in parentheses in the Scoring Guide that is included
with the assessment.
<P>The Civil War is also the subject of Geography and Literature during
the month of March. There are three lessons in the American Geography unit.
They use maps and graphs to offer some background to American History this
month. American Geography Lesson 14, "Regions of the USA" offers definitions
of the terms "region," "North" and "South" and uses maps of the USA. Students
will meet these three terms during American History lessons on The Civil
War. American Geography Lesson 15, "North and South in the 1800s (Part
1)" uses special purpose maps to describe the differences in landforms,
climate, and economy in the North and South in the 1800s. Lesson 16, "North
and South in the 1800s (Part 2)" uses circle or pie graphs to compare the
proportion of population, wealth produced, railroad mileage, factories,
bank deposits, and farms in the North and South in the 1800s. Use Geography
Lessons 14 and 15 before American History Lesson 24. Use American Geography
Lesson 16 after American History Lesson 28.
<P>If you plan to use the assessment provided for this month, ask students
to carefully store all of the handouts they receive over the course of
the unit. They will need to use them to study for this test, as it contains
much content. You will also want to assign study of the materials on these
sheets for homework, and may wish to review with students good study skills.
It would be best for students if they were told to begin to study each
of the handouts as it is received instead of trying to "cram" just prior
to the administration of the assessment.
<P>In Literature this month, there is one lesson on Frederick Douglass'
<I>Narrative
of the Life of Frederick Douglass, An American Slave, Written By Himself,</I>
a slave narrative that illustrates the conditions of slavery, one of the
causes of The Civil War. Use the lesson on Frederick Douglass after American
History Lesson 25.
<P>The Civil War is the subject of American Geography and History in April.

<P>Teacher Background
<P>This is part of a series of lessons in History, Geography, and Literature
about the American Civil War. These lessons continue through the month
of April. This lesson must follow American geography Lesson 15 because
it discusses how the differences in way of life between North and South
and the issue of paid labor versus slave labor divided the United States
and pushed the country closer to Civil War. In this lesson, students read
for information a fact sheet that describes the economic and social differences
between Northern and Southern States, and the Missouri Compromise of 1820.
<P>The Mason-Dixon Line was drawn by two English surveyors. In the 1770s,
Mason and Dixon surveyed the Maryland-Pennsylvania border in order to settle
a boundary dispute between the two colonies. Unfortunately, by the early
1800s, Americans saw the Mason-Dixon Line as the unofficial boundary between
the Northern and Southern states.
<P>In the early 1800s, the Northern states were rapidly becoming industrialized.
The population of Northern cities increased. Industry grew and factories
employed thousands of workers. At the same time, the Southern economy remained
largely agricultural. Though most people worked on small farms, large cotton,
sugar, rice, and tobacco plantations based on slave labor were the most
profitable.
<P>These differences between North and South intensified with the passage
of time and the issue of slave labor versus paid labor became a central
issue of conflict. During the same period,
<P>Western Expansion was proceeding rapidly. By the year 1819, when Missouri
applied for
<P>admission to the Union as a slave state, the possibility of its admission
threatened the balance of power in Congress between the so-called slave
states and free states. The Missouri Compromise resulted. According to
its terms, with the exception of Missouri, no state north of the Missouri
Compromise Line, a line drawn across the mainland at north latitude 36
30' and which includes the Mason-Dixon Line, was allowed to be a slave
state. However, slavery was permitted in territories south of that line.
This resulted in an America that was half free and half slave.
<P>Students are familiar with boundary lines drawn on maps and so the Mason-Dixon
Line will be easily understood. However, the division into North and South
that it represents may be more abstract. Students may need to be reminded
of the Treaty of Tordesillas during the Age of Exploration in World History.
That treaty gave all the New World territories west of a given line of
longitude to Spain and all those to the east of that line to Portugal.
In both cases, a more or less arbitrary line was used to mark the boundary
between two spheres of influence. In American History in the Third Grade,
students got an introduction to the Civil War.
<P>Procedure
<P>Ask the students to recall that in prior World History lessons they
learned that territories grow or shrink in size. Remind them of Czechoslovakia,
a country in western Europe that broke up into smaller states in 1993.
Tell the students that in the 1800s, the US fought the American Civil War
and divided into two parts, the Union in the north and the Confederacy
in the south. Write the words "Union" and "Confederacy" on the board. Explain
that a civil war is a war that takes place inside a country, between different
sides of the same nation. Ask the students to guess at possible reasons
for the Civil War. (Answers may vary.)
<P>Tell the students that first, they will read the fact sheet titled "Two
Causes of the
<P>American Civil War," which gives two reasons why the people of the United
States were divided. Second, they will discuss the information they got
from reading.
<P>Distribute copies of the fact sheet to the students, tell them they
will be reading for information, and ask them to read carefully. Ask the
students to pay attention to the title "Two Causes of the American Civil
War," which tells them what they should know after they have finished reading.
Ask the students to scan the title and decide what the fact sheet is about
(causes of the Civil War). Ask the students for the number of causes the
fact sheet discusses (two). Ask the students to pay attention to the numbered
subheadings, which tell where the information on each of the two causes
of the American Civil War is located. Tell the students that they may highlight
or underline sections of the fact sheet that they think are important to
the topic. Allow students to use dictionaries or discuss with their classmates
while they read. Inform the students that you will help with any difficulties
they may have reading the fact sheet. While students are reading, circulate
among them to make sure that they stay on task. If a sufficient number
of students in your class are experiencing difficulty reading the fact
sheet, bring them together again as a whole class and have students read
various paragraphs or lines aloud and attempt to explain them, or lead
the reading and discussion. You may also assign the students to pairs so
that they may read and discuss the fact sheet ahead of the class discussion.
<P>When students have all read the fact sheet, ask for volunteers to place
the important dates (1763-1767, 1799, 1820, 1827, 1861-1865) in the history
time-line you have been keeping in the class. Ask: What is a civil war?
(war between sides belonging to the same nation) Ask: When did the American
Civil War take place? (1861-1865) Ask: What were the sides fighting the
Civil War? (North and South) Remind the students that in a prior American
Geography lesson, they learned that regions can be divided using climate,
landforms, etc. Ask: What made the North and South regions? (location,
way of life, slavery, industry, etc) Put up the transparency of the map
of the Missouri Compromise of 1820 (attached), and indicate the Mason-Dixon
Line, the Missouri Compromise Line, and the states of North and South.
<P>Tell the students that when two nations go to war, it can happen very
suddenly, but that the causes of a civil war may have begun many years
before physical fighting breaks out. Ask: What are the two causes of The
Civil War discussed in this fact sheet? (slavery, different ways of life)
Ask: What events showed that North and South had different views about
slavery (slavery lawful in the South but unlawful in the North) Ask: Why
was slavery unlawful in the North? (slaves were not needed, people believed
that slavery was wrong) Ask: Why were people in the North against slavery
in the South? (took the jobs of white men, was wrong) Ask: Why was slavery
lawful in the South? (slaves were used on plantations)
<P>Ask: What is a plantation? (large farms in the South using slaves to
grow tobacco, rice, sugar cane, and cotton) Ask: What is a compromise?
(agreement in which each side gets less than what it originally wanted)
Ask: What does the term "Union" refer to in the fact sheet? (USA)
<P>Ask: How did the Mason-Dixon Line affect the divisions between North
and South? (Answers may vary.) Ask: How did the settlement of Missouri
affect the unity of the USA in 1820? (Answers may vary.)
<P>Show students pictures of scenes that illustrate the differences between
the ways of life of the industrial North and the agricultural South. "America,
North and South," Chapter Two of <I>A Nation Torn</I> by Delia Ray includes
black-and-white pictures that are suitable for this purpose. They include
pictures of bustling traffic on Broadway in New York, a scene of travel
by rail, a picture of heavy industry, and a contrasting image of a Southern
town, Petersburg, Virginia. Read the captions attached to the pictures
to the students. Show students pictures of slave and plantation life in
the South and ask students for their comments on what they have seen and
read in this lesson. Finally, suggest appropriate reading materials to
interested students.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Fifth Grade - American History - Lesson 24 - Toward the Civil War (Part
1)
<P>FACT SHEET: TWO CAUSES OF THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>In this fact sheet, you will read about the divisions between the North
and the South.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>The American Civil War started in 1861 and ended in 1865. A civil war
is fought by groups of people from the same nation. In America, these groups
were the North and the South.
<P>1. North and South
<P>When the fighting began in 1861, the USA was divided into North and
South. In the late 1700s, two American colonies, Pennsylvania and Maryland
had a border dispute. They couldn't agree where one colony's territory
ended and the other began. To solve this dispute, between 1763 and 1767,
two English surveyors Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon drew a line to mark
the border between Pennsylvania and Maryland. (See the attached map.) By
the 1820s, life on either side of this line was quite different. Americans
saw the Mason-Dixon line as a sort of boundary between North and South.
In Pennsylvania and the states north of the Mason-Dixon Line, slavery was
unlawful and many people worked in factories. In Maryland and the states
south of the Mason-Dixon Line, slaves worked on plantations. Plantations
were large farms in the South that grew one crop, sugar cane, tobacco,
rice or cotton, and used slave labor.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>The meaning of North and South
<P>The terms "North" and "South" meant the Atlantic or east coast of the
United States where the original states of the Union were located. On a
map, the North was the area from the Maryland-Pennsylvania border north
to the Canadian border. The South was the area south of the Maryland-Pennsylvania
border. (See the attached map.)
<P>North and South were similar in some ways. They were regions of the
same country. They traded with each other. They spoke the same language.
In both North and South most people were small farmers. However, there
were two important differences between North and South. First, slavery
had ended in the 1790s in most places in the North but continued in the
South. Second, the North was rapidly becoming industrialized, which meant
many workers earned their living producing iron, steel, machinery, and
cloth in factories. Factory workers received pay for their labor and were
free to work wherever they wished. In the South, most crops were produced
on very large farms called plantations.
<P>Plantations grew cotton, sugar, rice, and tobacco and held slaves. Slaves
received food and lodging for their work but received no pay and had no
freedom to stop working. In the 1850s, slaves did almost all the hardest
work and 80% of skilled labor on these plantations. Slaves were considered
as property, driven to do very hard work, forced to live in terrible conditions,
and punished very harshly by their masters. Plantations using slave labor
were the most profitable businesses in the South. When people thought of
the North, they thought of Northern factories. When people thought of the
South, they pictured Southern plantations.
<P>That the North was becoming industrialized while the South remained
agricultural affected how both sides viewed slaves. Some Northerners opposed
slaves because they felt slaves took the jobs of white men. Some Southerners
supported slavery because they felt they needed the slaves to make their
plantations profitable.
<P>2. Missouri Compromise of 1820
<P>By the late 1700s and early 1800s, the Atlantic or east coast of the
US became crowded and Americans started settling the West. Western territories
could apply to Congress to become new states of the Union as the USA is
also called. However, while the West was being settled, back east, Northern
and Southern states were quarreling over slavery. The North did not want
Western territories to enter the Union as slave states. The South wanted
slavery to be lawful in the new states.
<P>In 1819, Missouri, a western state applied to join the Union as a slave
state. (See the attached map.) In Congress, angry quarrels broke out between
the North and South. It took a year for North and South to reach a compromise.
A compromise is a way of settling a dispute in which each side gets less
than what it originally wanted. There were two agreements in this compromise.
First, Missouri was admitted to the Union as a slave state but so was Maine,
a northern territory where slavery was unlawful. States where slavery was
unlawful were called "Free states." States where slavery was allowed were
called "Slave states." Second, Congress drew a line across the US from
east to west. This so-called Missouri Compromise Line included the Mason-Dixon
Line. According to the compromise, states north of the Missouri Compromise
Line, except Missouri would be free states while states south of the line
would be slave states.
<P>By the mid 1800s, America was divided into an industrial North using
paid labor and an agricultural South where there were slaves.

<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Teacher Background
<P>In Lesson 24, students were introduced to two causes of the American
Civil War: (1) the differences in the ways of life between North and South
and (2) the issue of paid labor versus slave labor. In this lesson, students
will read about two more causes of The Civil War: (1) slavery and (2) states'
rights, and how the Harriet Beecher Stowe novel, <I>Uncle Tom's Cabin</I>,
the Dred Scott Supreme Court Decision, the harshness of slave life, and
the John Brown incident further divided and pushed America to the brink
of Civil War.
<P><I>Reading Mastery IV</I>, Lessons 76 to 82, contains extracts from
a story of Harriet Tubman, titled "Slave Life." In Fifth Grade World History,
students learned of the 'Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade.' In Third Grade, American
History, students were introduced to 'Slavery in the Colonies.' Students
were introduced to 'The Civil War' in American History in the Second Grade.
They should be able to relate the central issues of serfdom in Russia to
slavery in America, having read about serfdom in the Fourth and Fifth Grades
in World History. Students will need a basic understanding of how American
Government works in order to understand the issue of states' rights. In
the Second and Fourth Grades in American History, students were introduced
to the principles of American constitutional government.
<P>In this lesson, students will read a fact sheet titled "Two More Causes
of the American Civil War" which identifies two additional causes of the
American Civil War: (1) slavery, and (2) states' rights. States' rights
refers to the demands made by Southern states for state governments to
decide whether or not to make slavery legal. The fact sheet contains information
on what life was like on a plantation and some ways in which slaves resisted
slavery or adapted to it. It contains a description of the role of Harriet
Beecher Stowe's novel <I>Uncle Tom's Cabin</I> in convincing Northerners
that slavery was an evil system. It discusses the Dred Scott Decision which
re-opened the question of whether or not states had the right to decide
whether to make slavery legal or illegal. The fact sheet also describes
the John Brown attack on Harper's Ferry and how it convinced Southerners
that Northerners were determined to end slavery by force if that was needed.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Procedure
<P>Ask for a volunteer to read aloud the starting date of The Civil War
from the time-line you have been keeping in class. Ask for students to
recall the definition of a civil war (war between sides belonging to the
same nation) to identify the sides involved in The Civil War (North and
South) and the two causes of the war they read about in the previous American
History class (different ways of life between the industrial North and
the agricultural South, paid labor in the North versus slave labor in the
South).
<P>Ask for the names of some Northern states (New York, New Jersey, Illinois,
Indiana, etc.) and for the names of some Southern states (Maryland, North
Carolina, South Carolina, etc.) Put up the transparency of the map of the
Missouri Compromise of 1820 and indicate the location of the states mentioned.
<P>Ask: What did the North and South have in common? (same country, language,
trade between them) Ask: How were the two regions different? (more industrialized
North, more agricultural South, after 1820, slavery unlawful in North,
lawful in South) Ask: What were the most profitable businesses in the South
in the 1800s? (plantations) Ask: What is a plantation? (large farm in the
South growing one crop and depending on slave labor) Ask: What were the
main plantation crops in the South in the 1800s? (rice, tobacco, sugar
cane, cotton) Ask: Did small farms depend on slaves? (no)
<P>Ask: How did most people in the North earn their living? (working on
small farms) Remind the students that more and more Northerners began working
in factories in the 1800s. Ask the students to identify the products these
factory workers produced (iron, steel, machinery, cloth). Ask the students
to compare slave labor in the South and paid labor in the North. (Slaves
received food and lodging, had no freedom to stop working, were considered
property, were forced to do hard work, were punished harshly while paid
workers received a wage and were free to work wherever they wished.)
<P>Ask: How did the Mason-Dixon Line get its name? (names of the surveyors
who drew it) Ask: Why was the Mason-Dixon Line drawn? (to settle a territorial
dispute between two American colonies, Pennsylvania and Maryland) Ask the
students to discuss the view that the
<P>Mason-Dixon Line helped divide the USA in the 1800s. (Answers may vary.)
<P>Ask: What is a compromise? (settlement where each side gets less than
it originally wanted) Remind the students that they read about the Missouri
Compromise of 1820. Ask: Why was the agreement named after Missouri? (Missouri
had applied to become a slave state of the Union and its application worsened
the conflict between North and South.) Ask the students to discuss the
statement that the Missouri Compromise further divided the USA. (Missouri
Compromise created an America that was half free and half slave.)
<P>Tell the students that they will now read the fact sheet titled "Two
More Causes of the American Civil War," which describes some events that
further divided the people of the United States.
<P>Distribute copies of the fact sheets to the students, and tell them
they will be reading for information. Tell the students that when reading
for information they may use strategies that are different from the strategies
they use when they are reading for entertainment. Explain that in reading
for information, they must locate the most important facts. In doing so,
they may highlight or underscore paragraphs or lines that they think are
important. Tell the students that they may re-read a line or a paragraph
and discuss the contents of the fact sheet with one another.
<P>Preview the fact sheet with the students by asking individuals to read
aloud the headings "Slavery" and "States' rights," then the sub-headings
and tell the students that these headings and subheadings organize the
information in the fact sheet. Illustrate this point by telling the students,
for example, that under the heading "Slavery," they will find information
related to slavery. Inform students that you are available to help with
difficulties they may have reading the fact sheet. Go around the room and
ensure that students stay on task. Bring the students together again as
a class if they are having difficulties reading the fact sheet independently.
In that case, you may lead the reading, or ask volunteers to read the fact
sheet aloud. Discuss the information as you go along.
<P>After students have read the fact sheet, bring them together as a class
for discussion. Ask for volunteers to suggest where to place the important
dates (1831, 1852, 1857, 1859) on the history time-line you have been keeping
in the class.
<P>Ask the students to talk about the most interesting piece of information
they have read in the fact sheet. Ask: Did they expect that a novel would
make people want to take up arms against slavery? (Answers may vary.) Ask:
What are people who fought for the end of slavery called? (Abolitionists)
Ask students whether they recall the names of any famous abolitionists?
(Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass, etc.) Ask the students to think of
whether the abolitionists had a difficult task convincing Americans that
slavery was evil and to describe the challenges they faced doing so. (Answers
may vary.) Ask: Would you consider Harriet Beecher Stowe an abolitionist?
(Answers may vary.) Ask the students to explain their answers and inform
them that Harriet Beecher Stowe is considered an abolitionist. Ask the
students to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of using a novel to
convince people that slavery was wrong. (Answers may vary.) Ask the students
to discuss what Harriet Beecher Stowe would have to know in order to write
about slavery in such a way as to convince readers that slavery was wrong.
(Answers may vary.) Ask: How did Harriet Beecher Stowe have learned about
slavery? (on visits to her friends in the slave state of Kentucky) Ask
the students to discuss how they would convince fellow Americans that slavery
was wrong had they been abolitionists in the 1800s. (Answers may vary.)
<P>Ask the students to explain the term "resist" (fight against). Ask for
their opinion on which was easier for a slave, resisting or adapting to
slavery. (Answers may vary.) Ask the students: What qualities would someone
need to resist slavery? (Answers may vary.) Ask the students to think of
the uses to which they put songs and music in their own lives. (Answers
may vary.) Ask the students to discuss how easy or difficult they think
it might have been for slaves to imagine themselves free while they were
still slaves. (Answers may vary.) Invite the students to discuss those
aspects of slavery they find most difficult to understand. (Answers may
vary.) Ask the students what they would have dreaded most had they been
slaves. (Answers may vary.) Ask the students whether the Africans kept
any aspect of their African culture while they were slaves (music). Ask
the students to describe what Spirituals are (a kind of song made from
the music of Africa and stories from the Bible).
<P>Ask: What is a decision? (in this piece, a ruling by a court) Invite
the students to discuss the Dred Scott Decision and why it pleased people
in the South but enraged people in the North. (Answers may vary.) Ask the
students whether they consider John Brown a hero or a villain and to explain
their answers. (Answers may vary.) Ask the students what message should
both the North and the South have received from John Brown's attack on
Harper's Ferry. (Answers may vary.) Ask the students to discuss what the
attack on Harper's Ferry might suggest about how determined people were
both to defend and to fight against slavery. (Answers may vary.)
<P>Ask the students to summarize the two causes of The Civil War that they
read about in this fact sheet (slavery and states' rights). Ask the students
to explain what they understand by the term "states' rights." (the right
of states and not the federal government to decide certain issues) Ask:
What did the Missouri Compromise of 1820 do about slavery? (restricted
slavery to the South) Ask: How did the Dred Scott decision affect the Missouri
Compromise of 1820? (ruled that it was unlawful) Ask: What did the Dred
Scott Decision do for states' rights? (advanced states' rights in matters
of slavery)
<P>Finally, ask the students to discuss what they think is likely to happen
next in the conflict between the North and the South. Tell them that in
the following lesson, they will read about how some states in the South
seceded or broke away from the USA.
<P>See the "Suggested Books" section above for materials that can be used
with this lesson.
<P>FACT SHEET: TWO MORE CAUSES OF THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>In the fact sheet titled "Two Causes of the American Civil War," you
read that in the early 1800s America was divided between an industrial
North that depended on paid labor and an agricultural South that depended
on slave labor. In this fact sheet, you will read about two more causes
of the Civil War.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>SLAVERY
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>The Missouri Compromise of 1820 turned America into a country that was
half slave and half free. Some people in the North were against slavery.
They argued that: (1) slavery took the jobs of whites, and (2) slavery
was wrong. Many in the South were for slavery. They felt that: (1) slavery
was profitable, and (2) slavery was not wrong. Some people fought to end
slavery. They were called "Abolitionists."
<P>1. Harriet Beecher Stowe's Novel, <I>Uncle Tom's Cabin</I>
<P>A teacher wrote a novel that convinced many Northerners that slavery
was wrong. She was Harriet Beecher Stowe. Harriet Beecher Stowe was born
in Massachusetts, a free state. She had friends in the slave state of Kentucky.
On her visits to her friends in Kentucky, she witnessed slavery. Harriet
Beecher Stowe published <I>Uncle Tom's Cabin </I>in 1852. It was the story
of Uncle Tom. Uncle Tom was a kind and religious slave who saved the life
of a white girl, but who was later sold to a cruel master. One night, two
slaves escaped from the plantation and Uncle Tom refused to say where they
were hiding. His master whipped Uncle Tom to his death for this. 300,000
copies of <I>Uncle Tom's Cabin </I>were sold in one year. One copy of a
book is often read by more than one person so this added up to a lot of
readers. In fact, <I>Uncle Tom's Cabin</I> has been called the biggest
bestseller of all time. The novel made Northern readers angry and want
take up arms to force the South to end slavery.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>2. Slave Life and Resistance
<P>The slaves themselves resisted slavery. To resist means "to fight against."
Some slaves resisted peacefully. Others were violent. Some slaves ran away
to the North. Some runaways helped others escape. This was the case of
Harriet Tubman who helped run the Underground Railroad, a series of places
where slaves could get help to run to freedom. Slaves deliberately damaged
work tools or farm equipment. Slaves poisoned their masters. Some slaves
revolted. Nat Turner, for example, led a slave revolt in Virginia in 1831.
Others acted lazy. Even killing oneself was a way of resisting slavery!
<P>However, many slaves adapted to slave life. Some became Christians and
looked to heaven as a reward for their suffering on earth. Others imagined
themselves free even while they were still slaves. This they did through
Spirituals, a new kind of song made from the music of Africa and the stories
of Christianity. Spirituals are still sung today and include "Swing Low
Sweet Chariot" and "Go Down, Moses." They are often based on Bible stories
of how the people of Israel were delivered from slavery in Egypt.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>STATES' RIGHTS
<P>The USA is a union of states. Federal and state governments share power.
In the 1800s, some Southern states argued that it was the right of the
state to decide whether or not to allow slavery. This right and others
are sometimes referred to as "states' rights."
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>1. The Dred Scott Supreme Court Decision
<P>Dred Scott was a slave whose master took him from the slave state of
Missouri to the free state of Wisconsin. There, Dred Scott married Harriet.
They had two daughters. Then, his master moved back to Missouri and took
Scott and his family back as slaves. Dred Scott sued his master. He argued
that he was free because he had lived in a free territory. Abolitionists
(people fighting for the end of slavery) paid his legal bills. Abolitionist
lawyers argued his case before the Supreme Court. They were disappointed.
In 1857, the Supreme Court, the highest court in the land ruled against
Scott. A ruling by a court is called a decision. This ruling was called
the Dred Scott Decision. The court felt that Scott was property so he could
not sue. Also, the court declared the Missouri Compromise of 1820 to be
unlawful. The Missouri Compromise of 1820 had restricted slavery to the
South. Under the Dred Scott Decision, it became a state's right to decide
whether or not to allow slavery. The South was happy for the Dred Scott
decision, but the North was enraged. Fortunately, Dred Scott and his family
were freed by a later owner and got jobs in St. Louis, Missouri. Dred Scott
died one year later.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>2. John Brown at Harper's Ferry
<P>In October, 1859, John Brown tried to capture weapons in a Federal weapons
storeroom at Harper's Ferry. Harper's Ferry was part of what was then Virginia
but is now West Virginia. John Brown was accompanied by eighteen men. This
included five free African-Americans and two of his sons. They intended
to arm slaves and urge them to revolt against their masters. Federal and
local troops got wind of his plans and waited for John Brown and his men.
Brown's sons were killed in the attack and he was captured, tried, and
sentenced to be hanged. In the North, people made a hero out of John Brown.
On the day of his death, church bells tolled and cannons were fired in
celebration of his bravery.
<P>Many Southerners, however, were angry that the North had made a hero
out of John Brown. They felt the whole North was like John Brown, ready
to use violence to end slavery in the South. Southerners wanted to maintain
their way of life. They argued that the only way to preserve their way
of life was to secede, or break away from the rest of the USA. Southern
states felt it was a state's right to allow slavery or not. They felt they
had the right to leave the Union as well. The North held the opposite point
of view. The North felt that no state had a right to leave the Union.

<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Teacher Background
<P>This lesson deals with the election of Abraham Lincoln as the sixteenth
president of the United States. Lincoln's election led to the secession
of some Southern states. In Lessons 24 and 25, students were introduced
to the ways in which America was divided between North and South. They
also read about four causes of the American Civil War. This lesson describes
some events that occurred before the outbreak of the Civil War. It includes
an explanation of Lincoln's statement that "a house divided against itself
cannot stand." In Second Grade, American History, students were introduced
to Abraham Lincoln in the context of the Civil War.
<P>Procedure
<P>Ask the students to recall the issues that divided North and South in
the 1850s (paid labor versus slave labor, industrial North versus agricultural
South, slavery, states' rights). Ask the students to think of the incidents
that most people in the North and South would be discussing in the late
1850s (Dred Scott Decision, slavery, John Brown's attack on Harper's Ferry
and his execution). Ask the students to state what attitudes they think
North and South held toward each other after the publication of <I>Uncle
Tom's Cabin, </I>the Dred Scott Decision, and especially the execution
of John Brown (distrust, suspicion, hostility).
<P>Write the title on the board and tell the students that they will read
the fact sheet "The Union is Dissolved!" Preview the fact sheet by asking
the students to read the title and explain what the term "Union" means
(USA) and why the USA is called a union (grouping of states). Ask: What
does the term "dissolved" mean? (broken) Ask: What would you expect to
read about in a fact sheet titled "The Union is Dissolved!" (Answers may
vary.) If students do not explain the title, tell them that in reference
to the Union, "dissolved" means "broken."
<P>Ask the students to think of the types of events that might push states
to secede from the Union. (Answers may vary.) Ask the students to think
of which region, the North or South, might secede from the Union. (Answers
may vary.) Ask the students to recall the information in previous American
History lessons and decide what events or issues suggest that states had
for some time been considering breaking away (issue of states' rights).
Explain that the issue of states' rights included the question of whether
a state had the right to leave the Union, or secede.
<P>Distribute the fact sheet to the students, ask them to read it, and
ensure that students stay on task. Assist students who might have difficulty
reading the fact sheet by explaining difficult words or suggesting the
use of a dictionary. You may circulate materials containing pictures of
Abraham Lincoln at this time. See the "Suggested Books" section above for
materials that you may use with your lesson.
<P>After students have read the fact sheet, ask for volunteers to suggest
where to place the important dates on the history time-line you have been
keeping in the class (1809, 1858, 1860, 1861). Ask the students to discuss
the character of president Lincoln. (Answers may vary.) Ask the students
to comment on a similarity between Lincoln's boyhood and his adulthood
(public-speaking ability). Ask the students to use the fact that Lincoln
lost an election and still ran for office two years later to describe his
character (courageous, constant). Ask the students to use what they have
read about Lincoln to decide whether or not they consider Lincoln an abolitionist.
(Answers may vary.) Ask the students to explain why they decided Lincoln
was or wasn't an abolitionist. (Answers may vary.)
<P>Ask the students to use information from the fact sheet to list ways
in which people running for public office in the 1800s got their message
across to the voters (handbills, posters, public debates, newspaper reports).
Ask the students to list some of the means of communication available now
but not available to Lincoln and Douglas (radio, TV) and to discuss the
difficulties Lincoln and Douglas might have faced reaching voters outside
their states and how they might have overcome these difficulties. (Answers
may vary.)
<P>Ask the students to think of reasons why voters in any period in history
might select one candidate over an another in an election to public office.
(Answers may vary.) Ask: What character traits might voters in the 1800s
have appreciated in a candidate running for public office that might still
be important today. (Answers may vary.) Ask the students to think of the
advantage Douglas might have had over Lincoln in their campaign for the
Senate seat in 1858 (better known, experienced). Ask the students to think
of how a candidate's fame might help in getting him or her elected to office.
(Answers may vary.) Ask the students: What did Lincoln tell the nation
about his plans for slavery after his election? (He would not end slavery
where it already existed.) Ask: Did the South trust Lincoln? (no) Ask the
students to think of reasons why the South might not have trusted Lincoln's
plans for slavery? (Answers may vary.)
<P>Ask: Which was the first state to secede or break away? (South Carolina)
Put up the transparency of the map of the Union and the Confederacy, explain
that the map shows Confederate states and Union states and territories,
and ask the students to describe South Carolina's location (Southern state
bordering North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia). Remind the students
that by 1861, eleven states had broken away from the Union. Ask the students
to identify those states and locate them on the map (South Carolina, Mississippi,
Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee,
and North Carolina). Ask the students to recall the name given to the new
republic formed by the states that had broken away from the Union (Confederacy,
Confederate States of America) and to identify and locate its capital on
the map (Richmond, Virginia).
<P>Remind the students that in prior American History lessons, the unofficial
boundary of the North and South was the Missouri Compromise Line of 1820
which included the Mason-Dixon Line. Point out to students that not all
the states that had been considered Southern states in earlier lessons
seceded. Point to the fact that Maryland, Missouri, and Kentucky, all slave
states, did not secede. Tell them that this means not every Southern state
or every slave state joined the Confederate States of America. Ask the
students to think of reasons why Southern states such as Maryland, Missouri,
and Kentucky might not have seceded but stayed with the Union. (Answers
may vary.) Point also to the fact that since the Missouri Compromise of
1820, the map of the USA had changed and that by 1861, several western
states such as California and Oregon (point them out) had joined the Union.
Remind the students that the admission of western states to the Union and
the issue of whether they should enter as slave states or free states had
posed a problem for the USA from the time of the Missouri Compromise of
1820.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>Discussion
<P>You may ask your students to discuss the following scenario in class.
<P>America is close to civil war between North and South. You have been
given unlimited power to negotiate a settlement to prevent a war between
North and South. Keeping in mind that slaves do all of the hardest work
and eighty percent of the skilled work in the South, describe how you would
end slavery in a way that slaves, the North, and the South would accept.
Consider the impact of the changes you propose.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>FACT SHEET: THE UNION IS DISSOLVED!
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>In the two previous fact sheets, you have read about the divisions between
North and South. In this fact sheet, you will read about the election of
Abraham Lincoln as sixteenth president of the USA and how his election
pushed some Southern states to leave the Union.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>1. Abraham Lincoln
<P>One person who knew Abraham Lincoln described him as a long and skinny
kid with big feet and dark hair. Abraham Lincoln was born in the slave
state of Kentucky in 1809. Growing up, he loved to play pranks, and tell
jokes and stories. Sometimes, he stood on a tree stump and pretended he
was a preacher or a public speaker.
<P>Lincoln's family were poor Baptists who felt slavery was wrong. They
moved to the free state of Indiana while Abraham was still a boy. Later,
they moved on to Illinois, where Abraham became a shopkeeper, and a self-trained
lawyer. Soon his friends persuaded him to run for political office. His
friends knew that he was an honest man. He was a shopkeeper who once walked
six miles to return a few pennies to a customer whom he had overcharged.
Abraham Lincoln was a skillful public speaker. And, he believed that slavery
was wrong.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>2. Lincoln-Douglas Debates
<P>In 1858, Lincoln ran for a seat in the Senate. He lived in Illinois,
a free state on the northern boundary of the Missouri Compromise Line,
the line that separated free states from slave states. Lincoln was backed
by the Republican Party. His opponent was Stephen Douglas. Douglas was
a member of the Democratic Party. Douglas held that seat and was seeking
re-election. This meant that Douglas was much better known than Lincoln.
On the night the Republican Party chose him as its candidate in the race
for the Senate, Lincoln made a speech. In that speech, he said: "A house
divided against itself cannot stand."
<P>In those days, candidates who wished to be elected used mainly posters
and handbills to take their message to the voters. However, Lincoln challenged
Douglas to a series of public debates. In these debates, Lincoln argued
that slavery was wrong. Douglas argued that each state should decide whether
to continue or end slavery. Lincoln said Douglas was pro-slavery. The debates
drew very large crowds. Newspaper reporters printed the texts of the debates
and wired them all over the country. It seemed that the public speaking
skills Lincoln had been developing from his boyhood days were being put
to the best possible use.
<P>Unfortunately, Lincoln lost the Senate race. He described how he felt
about his defeat. Lincoln compared himself to a boy who had stubbed his
toe. He explained that he was too big to cry and too badly hurt to laugh.
Even though Lincoln had lost the elections, he had scored a victory. The
debates had made him famous.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>3. "A house divided against itself cannot stand"
<P>When he stated that "a house divided against itself cannot stand," Lincoln
used the term "house" to refer to the United States of America. Lincoln
felt that the division of the USA into a free North and a slave South was
not good for America. He explained that America would not forever remain
half slave and half free. He believed the Union had to become one thing
or the other, either completely slave or completely free.
<BR>&nbsp;
<P>4. Lincoln elected president, Southern states secede
<P>In 1860, two years after he failed to get elected senator from Illinois,
Lincoln ran for president of the USA. Once again, his opponent was Stephen
Douglas, the senator who had defeated Lincoln in 1858. Lincoln remained
opposed to slavery. He felt that blacks were equal to whites and that slavery
was evil. In 1860, Lincoln was elected sixteenth president of the USA.
He had not won the support of a single Southern state in the elections.
<P>Before taking office, Lincoln promised not to interfere with slavery
in the South. He intended only to prevent slavery from spreading to the
new territories in the West. Southerners did not believe Lincoln. They
thought of him as a friend of John Brown, the man who had launched the
attack on Harper's Ferry. They felt that their Southern way of life was
threatened by Lincoln's election. Lincoln's term as president would begin
in March, 1861. Even before that date, in December 1860, South Carolina
became the first state to secede or break away from the Union. A Charleston,
South Carolina newspaper, the <I>Charleston Mercury,</I> ran a headline
that read: "The Union is Dissolved!" This break-up of the Union was not
what Lincoln had wanted.
<P>During January and February 1861, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia,
Louisiana, and Texas seceded. This brought the total of states that had
seceded to seven. And Lincoln was yet to take office. In February 1861,
the states that had seceded formed a new republic. They called it the Confederate
States of America, also known as the Confederacy. In March 1861, when Lincoln
took office, the Southern states of Virginia, North Carolina, Kentucky,
Tennessee, Arkansas, and Maryland still had not seceded. During the months
of April and May, 1861, Virginia, Arkansas, Tennessee and North Carolina
seceded. This brought the total of states that had seceded to eleven. In
May 1861, Richmond, Virginia was chosen as the Confederate capital. Virginia
broke into two. The people in the western part of the state remained loyal
to the Union. They seceded from Virginia, formed the state of West Virginia,
and joined the Union.

lesson describes how the physical fighting began in the Civil War. It started
with the attack on Fort Sumter, a small fort on an island off Charleston
Harbor, South Carolina that both the Union and the Confederacy claimed.
Abraham Lincoln decided to bring in supplies of food to the fort. This
angered the Confederacy and prompted Confederate president Davis to fire
on Union positions, thereby starting the Civil War.
<P>The lesson also deals with the leadership of president Jefferson Davis
of the Confederacy. It introduces some of the disadvantages that would
plague Confederate soldiers as the Civil War stretched on. Supplement the
lesson with pictures from the "Suggested Books" section and other materials
where available.
<P>Procedure
<P>Tell the students that this lesson describes the president of the Confederate
States of America, Jefferson Davis, and how the Civil War started. Tell
the students that first, they will look at a map of the site of the first
battle, and pictures of the fighting. Then, they will listen to what happened.
<P>Put up the transparency of the map of the Union and the Confederacy
and point to South Carolina and Fort Sumter. Circulate pictures showing
the fight and ask students to comment on the details of the fort, the men,
and the weapons involved. See the "Suggested Books" section above for list
of materials that can be used with this lesson.
<P>Explain to the students that Fort Sumter was a fort operated by the
United States of America but located on South Carolina territory. Tell
the students that the first cannon of the Civil War was fired because of
a dispute over who owned that small fort on a tiny island in the harbor
at Charleston, South Carolina. Explain that the two parties in the dispute
were the state of South Carolina and the United States of America and that
the state of South Carolina said the fort was hers and the federal government
said it belonged to all of the United States.
<P>Remind the students that president Abraham Lincoln felt South Carolina
had no right to break away from the Union in the first place. Remind the
students that obviously, South Carolina felt it had the right since South
Carolina felt that it was a state's right to decide whether or not to be
part of the Union. Tell the students that South Carolina demanded that
control of Fort Sumter be transferred to her. Ask the students: What do
you expect Lincoln's answer to be? (no) Emphasize that president Lincoln
responded that Fort Sumter belonged to all the American people. Ask: Why
was Fort Sumter so important to both sides? Explain that: (1) not only
was it a fort that any side could use in a war, but (2) it guarded one
of the most important shipping ports in the South, Charleston harbor.
<P>Explain that in the meantime, supplies were running short at Fort Sumter.
If president Lincoln sent no supplies in, the soldiers on Fort Sumter would
not have been able to fight and would have had to turn the fort over to
South Carolina. On the other hand, if Lincoln sent in supplies, the South
would start a war. Tell the students that Lincoln decided to send food
in. Ask the students to think of South Carolina's reaction to Lincoln's
decision not to turn Fort Sumter over to her but to send in supplies instead.
(Answers may vary.)
<P>Tell the students that the Confederacy felt Lincoln's decision to send
food to Fort Sumter was an act of war and demanded that the soldiers at
the fort surrender before the food supplies arrived. Ask the students to
think of the soldiers' response. (Answers may vary.) Emphasize that Union
soldiers at Fort Sumter refused to give in. Ask the students to predict
the Confederacy's reaction to the soldiers' refusal to surrender. (Answers
may vary.) Tell the students that on April 12, 1861, Confederate president
Davis ordered the Confederate Army to attack Fort Sumter. Explain that
after thirty-four hours, the Confederate Army stopped shelling, Fort Sumter
was reduced to ruins, no one was killed, but the Civil War had begun. Explain
to the students that the man who made the decision to fire on Fort Sumter
was Jefferson Davis, president of the Confederacy. Ask the students: Who
would be president Davis' opponent? (Lincoln)
<P>Explain to the students that like Lincoln, Jefferson Davis was born
in a log cabin in Kentucky. Tell them that Davis was born in 1808 to a
poor family who moved to Louisiana and then to Mississippi. Ask the students
whether this was similar to the Lincoln family's experience (yes). Tell
the students to state whether or not Davis and Lincoln were alike as kids
in the following areas. Then, tell them that Jefferson was a boy who loved
to play pranks (alike), that he was slim (alike), and honest (alike).
<P>Explain that Jefferson Davis attended the Military Academy at West Point
and later turned himself into a very learned man. Ask the students to recall
Lincoln's previous professions (shopkeeper, lawyer, politician) and how
he had become a lawyer (trained himself).
<P>Tell the students that Jefferson Davis believed that states had the
right to secede and that slavery should be allowed into the Western territories
of the USA. Ask the students to contrast Lincoln's views on states' rights
to secede and whether slavery should be allowed in the Western territories.
(Lincoln argued against a state's right to leave the Union and against
extending slavery to the West.) Ask the students to recall the name of
the new republic formed by the break-away states (Confederate States of
America). Ask the students to recall the divisions between the North and
the South and to state what they expected the Confederacy to decide in
regard to slavery (allowed it). Ask the students to recall the name and
location of the Confederate capital (Richmond, Virginia), point out Richmond's
location on the map of the Union and the Confederacy, and the location
of Washington D.C. the Union capital a 100 miles away.
<P>Tell the students that as a leader, Davis was quite different from Lincoln.
Explain that he was difficult to work with, often ill, had little power
to rule, and that unlike Lincoln, he couldn't write well, express himself
well, or inspire people. Ask: Why is it important for a leader to be able
to write and express himself well? (Answers may vary.) Ask: Why is it important
for a leader to be able to inspire people? (Answers may vary.) Ask the
students whether it would be even more important for a leader to be able
to express himself well and inspire people in times of war and why. (Answers
may vary.) Ask: Would you expect Jefferson Davis to be make an effective
leader during a war? (Answers may vary.) Ask the students to explain their
answers. Emphasize that partly because of Davis' poor leadership, soldiers
fighting in the Civil War were not getting the guns, the food, the clothes,
and the shoes they needed to fight.
<P>Next, ask the students what they thought was most surprising about the
account of the attack, what they thought was most interesting, and to summarize
one thing they had learned from the lesson that they had not known before.

<P>Teacher Background
<P>Lesson 27 provides the students' background for this lesson. In this
lesson, students will discuss the first big battle in the Civil War, the
First Battle of Bull Run, including the weather, location, and material
conditions of the battle.
<P>Procedure
<P>Ask the students to recall the start of the American Civil War. Ask:
Where did the first battle of The Civil War take place? (Fort Sumter, South
Carolina) Ask: How long did the attack on Fort Sumter last? (little more
than a day) Ask: Who won the attack on Fort Sumter? (the Confederacy) Ask:
Did anyone die in the attack on Fort Sumter? (no) Ask: Is that typical
of battles, that no one dies in them? (no) Remind the students that at
the end of the attack on Fort Sumter, Union forces headed for New York.
Ask the students whether they expected that to be the end of The Civil
War? (Answers may vary.)
<P>Tell the students that this lesson is about the first big battle of
The Civil War, the First Battle of Bull Run. Write the name of the battle
on the board. Ask the students to think of how the attack on Fort Sumter
got its name, and to use this information to explain how the Battle of
Bull Run got its name (from the site of the battle). Ask the students to
predict whether this battle would be bloodier than the attack on Fort Sumter
and to explain the reasons for their answers. (Answers may vary.)
<P>Tell the students that Northerners and Southerners used nicknames to
refer to each other. Remind the students that Southerners called Northerners
"Yankees," or "Yanks" and Northerners referred to the war as a "rebellion"
and to Southerners as "Rebels." Explain that when shortened, these names
became "Yanks" for Yankees, and "Rebs" for Rebels. Remind the students
that the Union Army chose blue for their official color and the Confederate
Army chose gray for its official color and that was often how they are
remembered: the North in blue, the South in gray.
<P>Explain however, that at first, soldiers tended to wear the uniform
of the militia from their home state or city and these uniforms were either
blue, gray, red, black, brown, or some other color. Ask: Why did soldiers
wear the uniforms of the their state militias and not the Confederate Army
colors? (not enough uniforms) Ask the students to guess at the number of
soldiers who fought in the Civil War from 1861 to 1865 (hundreds of thousands)
and to imagine how much time, money, and work were needed to make sufficient
uniforms for these men. Explain that as the war dragged on, the South had
fewer and fewer uniforms for all its soldiers. Ask the students: In your
opinion, who should be blamed for these problems? (Jefferson Davis, president
of the Confederacy) Remind students that Davis had little power to get
much done.
<P>Put up the transparency of the Union and the Confederacy on the overhead
and point to Bull Run. Explain that the battlefield is located in Virginia,
not far from Washington, near a muddy stream called Bull Run. Tell the
students that the Confederates called it the Battle of Manassas because
Manassas was a town near where the fighting took place. Tell the students
that there was a railroad junction close to the town of Manassas and the
rail line led to Richmond. Ask the students to recall the reason why Fort
Sumter was important to both the North and the South and to use the information
to find out why the town of Manassas was important. Ask the students to
look at the map on transparency for clues to explain the importance of
Manassas. Emphasize that Union Army generals planned to capture the nearby
town of Manassass and then travel to Richmond, Virginia by rail. Ask: Why
was Richmond important to the Union army? (Confederate capital) Remind
the students that in prior World History lessons, they learned that a capital
is the seat of government of a country. Ask: What effect might it have
on the Confederacy had the Union army captured its capital? (possible early
defeat)
<P>Tell the students that many Americans were still taking the war lightly.
Explain that while the soldiers were preparing for the First Battle of
Bull Run, Washingtonians or people from Washington (point to Washington
on the map) took it all as a spectacle and came in on horseback and wagons
with their picnic baskets, sat by, and watched the goings-on. Tell the
students that the battlefield was part woods and part meadows with very
steep slopes on both sides leading down to the river. Ask the students
what does the fact that some Washingtonians brought picnic baskets tell
about the season and the weather conditions (a hot summer day) on the battlefield.
<P>Ask the students to visualize the preparation for battle on this site
and to describe their visualization in terms of the colors, the numbers
of people, the movements, the sounds, etc. Ask the students to guess at
how the hot summer weather affected the soldiers. Explain that the weather
combined with the heavy wool uniforms they wore made it difficult for the
soldiers. Ask the students to guess at the other conditions that might
have made it difficult for soldiers preparing for battle (fear, hunger,
fatigue, confusion, weight carried, etc.).
<P>Tell the students that after nearly a day of fighting, many men had
been lost yet no side seemed to be winning. Tell the students that fresh
Confederate troops arrived by rail and that made all the difference in
this battle. Explain that these Confederate soldiers gave a battle cry
that terrified the Union soldiers and sent them packing and that as a result
of this railroad and the fresh troops it brought in, the South won the
First Battle of Bull Run. Tell the students that five thousand men were
injured or killed in that battle.
<P>See the "Suggested Books" section above for materials that can be used
with this lesson.
<P>Discussion
<P>Ask your students to discuss the following issue.
<P>No one died in the attack on Fort Sumter. However, the First Battle
of Bull Run or the Battle of Manassas claimed many lives. Yet, the American
Civil War went on until 1865. Discuss what both sides should have learned
from the First Battle of Bull Run and how the North and the South should
have responded to these lessons.
