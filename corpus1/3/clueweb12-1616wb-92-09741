<p>
Some time ago &quot;I Won't Revise&quot;, an amusing parody of &quot;I Will Survive&quot;, was posted on this group. Without checking the facts I immediately replied to sya that I knew the author, my predecessor as EU Sciffysoc Jed. (Visit her site at www.ed.ac.uk/~sesoc/jedweb <em>(possibly no longer valid)</em> for more song parody).<br />
</p>
<p>
As a number of people, including Jed herself, have pointed out, she didn't. (She did however write all the other IWS parodies on the site hence my confusion.) I offer the deepest afpologies. (Can a humble newbie do afpologies, or do I have to stick with ordinary apologies?)<br />
</p>
<p>
I also offer another IWS parody, which was definitely written by me.<br />

<blockquote>
<p>
I've always been afraid,<br />
I've been petrified<br />
Ever since I helped that tourist no-one's on my side.<br />
Every time I think it's over I want to break into song,<br />
But I'm proved wrong,<br />
A new adventure comes along.<br />
I don't look back,<br />
I just make space,<br />
As far as I'm concerned every encounter is a race.<br />
Maybe I'm a coward, but I'm fine with that you see,<br />
Everybody has a talent, and mine is just to flee<br />
So I go,<br />
Straight through the door.<br />
Don't turn around, no, I just keep on pumping floor.<br />
Nothing can catch you if your ready to fly.<br />
Mustn't stumble,<br />
Oh shit, this time I'm gonna die!<br />
Oh no, not I,<br />
I will survive,<br />
As long as I know how to run I might just stay alive.<br />
It's hard to do what's best,<br />
With a homocidal chest,<br />
But I'll survive.<br />
I will survive.<br />
Yeah, yeah!<br />
</p>
<p>
*PATRITIAN:*<br />
Without me this city would just fall apart,<br />
A pragmatic attitude is the right place to start.<br />
I saw that crime could be designed to regulate itself.<br />
Some people die,<br />
But the city still runs high.<br />
</p>
<p>
When I came back<br />
From that Leshp place<br />
It was almost worth it just to see the look upon Rust's face.<br />
The city runs like clockwork, and I'm the man with the key,<br />
And everybody knows it, so they don't bother me.<br />
I'm still in charge,<br />
Because it's true,<br />
What people want is leadership, it's nothing new.<br />
Some people maybe try,<br />
To complain that they're not free,<br />
But freedom is uncertian; you know where you are with me.<br />
I won't go,<br />
I've said before,<br />
I've really found out,<br />
Humanity's score.<br />
Stabilty, not justice, is what people desire,<br />
This town won't crumble,<br />
At least until I die.<br />
Oh not I,<br />
I will survive.<br />
Nobody really likes me, but I'm still worth more alive.<br />
With a mercentile empire,<br />
To rival a Zoon Liar,<br />
I will survive.<br />
I will survive<br />
Yeah, Yeah!<br />
</p>
