        <p>Most assets are liable to Capital Gains Tax when you sell 
          or dispose of them. These include shares, property, business 
          assets and personal possessions - whether they're in the UK 
          or overseas. But some assets are exempt – such as your car 
          and, in most cases, your main home. </p>
        <p class="jumpListHead">On this page:</p>

        <h2><a name="1"></a>Exempt assets - when you don't pay Capital

        <p> Some assets aren't liable to Capital Gains Tax at all because 
          they&#8217;re exempt. These include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> your car</li>
          <li> personal possessions worth up to &pound;6,000 each, such 
            as jewellery, paintings or antiques</li>
          <li> stocks and shares you hold in tax-free investment savings 
            accounts, such as ISAs and PEPs</li>
          <li> UK Government or 'gilt-edged' securities, for example,

        <h2> <a name="2"></a>Assets liable to Capital Gains Tax </h2>
        <p> Most assets - other than those covered above - are liable 
          to Capital Gains Tax when you sell or dispose of them. </p>
        <p>This section lists some of these assets. It also outlines 
          situations when you may not need to pay Capital Gains Tax, 
          even though the asset is usually liable.</p>
        <p>Usually if you pay Income Tax on the gain or profit you make 
          from disposing of an asset you won't have to pay Capital Gains 
          Tax on the gain too. For example, if you're trading as a property 
          dealer, jewellery maker or antiques dealer.</p>
        <p>If you're unsure whether you should be paying Income Tax 
          or Capital Gains Tax, please contact HM Revenue and Customs 
          (HMRC). </p>
        <p><a href="http://search2.hmrc.gov.uk/kbroker/hmrc/contactus/search.ladv?raction=view&amp;fl0=__dsid%3A&amp;sm=0&amp;ha=34&amp;as=1&amp;sp_scope=hmrc&amp;sc=hmrc&amp;nh=10&amp;sr=0&amp;cs=ISO-8859-1&amp;tx1=&amp;tx0=49688">Telephone 
          or write to HMRC</a></p>
        <h3> Property - including land, buildings and leases</h3>
        <p> Most property is liable to Capital Gains Tax. You must work 
          out the gain or loss if you sell or dispose of it.</p>
        <p>Types of property liable to Capital Gains Tax include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> a second home </li>
          <li>a property that you've rented out</li>
          <li> business premises, such as a shop or a farm</li>
          <li> land, such as agricultural land </li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, if you sell your main home - even though the asset 
          is liable to Capital Gains Tax - you may qualify for Private 
          Residence Relief. This may mean there's no tax to pay. </p>

          Residence Relief on your main home</a></p>

          and property</a></p>
        <h3> Shares, unit trusts and other investments</h3>
        <p> Disposals of shares, units in a unit trust and similar investments 
          are liable to Capital Gains Tax. You must work out the gain 
          or loss if you sell or dispose of them.</p>
        <p>Investments liable to Capital Gains Tax when you sell or 
          dispose of them include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> stocks and shares in a company</li>
          <li> units in a unit trust</li>
          <li> debentures, bonds (but not premium bonds) and certain 
            securities - these are generally investments in or loans 
            to a company or to the government</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There may be no tax to pay if your shares have been replaced 
          by new shares following a company reorganisation or take-over. 
        </p>
        <p>And if you still own shares but they&#8217;ve become worthless, 
          or worth next to nothing, you may be able to claim a loss.

        <h3>Antiques, jewellery and other personal possessions</h3>
        <p> Most personal possessions worth more than £6,000 are liable 
          to Capital Gains Tax. This applies to individual possessions 
          and collections or sets worth £6,000 as a whole. You must 
          work out the gain if you sell or dispose of them.</p>
        <p>Personal possessions liable to Capital Gains Tax (if they&#8217;re 
          worth more than &pound;6,000) include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> artwork - such as a painting </li>
          <li> collectors' items - such as a chess set </li>
          <li> antiques - such as furniture or jewellery </li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, there may be no tax to pay if <strong>both</strong> 
          of the following apply to the possession:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> it had an expected useful life of less than 50 years 
            when you got it </li>
          <li> it hasn&#8217;t been used in your trade or job </li>
        </ul>
        <p>An example of this might be a caravan or motor-boat you bought 
          and used for pleasure.</p>

          possessions and Capital Gains Tax</a></p>
        <h3>Business assets - such as business premises 'goodwill' and 
          registered trade mark</h3>
        <p> Many business assets are liable to Capital Gains Tax. These 
          may be buildings, equipment, fixtures and fittings, or even 
          the business's reputation ('goodwill'). You must work out 
          the gain or loss if you sell or dispose of such business assets.</p>
        <p>Some typical business assets liable to Capital Gains Tax 
          include: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> business premises - such as a shop </li>
          <li> fixtures and fittings - such as equipment you sell with 
            the premises</li>
          <li> goodwill &#8211; that is the good name or reputation 
            of the business </li>
          <li> shares in a personal company</li>
          <li> registered trade mark</li>
        </ul>
        <p> However, you may qualify for tax reliefs that reduce the 
          amount of Capital Gains Tax you pay. For example, you may 
          be able to claim Business Asset Roll-Over relief. You can 
          do this if you sell a business asset and re-invest the 'proceeds' 
          (usually the amount you receive) in a new business asset. 
          Or you may be able to claim Entrepreneurs' Relief if you've 
          sold your business or it's ceased trading. </p>

          reliefs for Capital Gains Tax</a></p>
        <p><a href="../businesses/">Read more about business assets 
          and Capital Gains Tax</a></p>
        <h3>Overseas assets </h3>
        <p>Overseas assets are liable to Capital Gains Tax if you're 
          'resident' - or 'ordinarily resident' - in the UK. For example, 
          if you choose to live or work in the UK and do so on a regular 
          basis, you're probably resident here. You are liable on gains 
          arising both in and outside the UK.</p>
        <p>Typical overseas assets include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> a holiday home abroad</li>
          <li> shares in a foreign company</li>
          <li> land overseas bought for development </li>
        </ul>
        <p>However, if you're 'resident' in the UK but not 'domiciled' 
          here, you may be able to claim what’s known as the 'remittance 
          basis'. This might perhaps be because you or your father were 
          born abroad, or you plan to live permanently abroad. You're 
          liable on all gains arising in the UK. You'll only be liable 
          on foreign gains when you bring them into (‘remit’ them to) 
          the UK. </p>
        <p>Residency, domicile and tax on foreign gains are complicated 
          subjects - a lot depends on the facts of each case. See more 
          in the guidance below or contact HMRC. </p>
