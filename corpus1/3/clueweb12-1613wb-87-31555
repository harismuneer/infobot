<h2>Description</h2></a>

<p>I visited the Afghan Embassy in Tokyo today. They confirmed that they first hoisted a new flag
on December 7th 2004 at President Karzai inauguration ceremony and introduced the flag as the new national flag of the newly born Islamic Republic of Afghanistan since then. The details of the coat-of-arms and flag are regulated in Chapter I, Article no. 19 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan adopted on January 4th 2004 and signed by Karzai as President of the Transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan at that time on January 26th 2004.</p>
<p>Differences from the <a href="af2002.html">flag of the Transitional Authority</a>:<ul>
	<li>flag proportion: 1:2 changes to 2:3
	<li>solar calendar year: 1380 changes to 1298 (i.e. 1919 AD, year of independence declaration from Great Britain)
	<li>a rising sun composed of 9 long and 8 short rays is added between the <em>shahada</em> and the <em>takbir</em> (<em>Allahu akbar</em>)
</ul>Jaume Oll&eacute; made the flag and arms images based on the new arms image given by the Embassy. Chapter I, Article no. 19 of the Constitution reads as follows:<blockquote>
The Afghan flag is made up of three equal parts, with black, red and green colors juxtaposed from
left to right perpendicularly. The width of every colored piece is equal to half of its length. The <a href="#coa">national emblem</a> is located in the center of the flag. The national emblem of the state of Afghanistan is composed of Mehrab and Pulpit in white color. Two flags are located on its sides.
In the upper-middle part of the insignia the sacred phrase of <em>There is no God but Allah and Mohammad is his prophet</em> and <em>Allah is Great</em> are placed along with a rising sun. The word <em>Afghanistan</em> and the year 1298 (solar calendar) are located in the lower part of the insignia. The emblem is encircled with two branches of wheat. The law shall regulate the use of national flag and emblem.</blockquote></p>
