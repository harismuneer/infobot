After the <a href="a/../Battle_of_Fort_Sumter">Battle of Fort Sumter</a>, South Carolina, Lincoln called for troops from all remaining states to recover the forts, resulting in the secession of four more states: <a href="a/../Virginia">Virginia</a> (<a href="a/../April_17">April 17</a>, <a href="a/../1861">1861</a>), <a href="a/../Arkansas">Arkansas</a> (<a href="a/../May_6">May 6</a>, <a href="a/../1861">1861</a>), <a href="a/../Tennessee">Tennessee</a> (<a href="a/../May_7">May 7</a>, <a href="a/../1861">1861</a>), and lastly, <a href="a/../North_Carolina">North Carolina</a> (<a href="a/../May_20">May 20</a>, <a href="a/../1861">1861</a>).

Meanwhile the Union organized a competing government of the state by calling a <a href="a/../Constitutional_Convention">constitutional convention</a>, originally convened to vote on secession.  Although Kentucky did not secede, for a time, it declared itself neutral in the conflict, and southern sympathizers organized a secession convention, and swore in a Confederate Governor, during a brief sojourn by the Confederate Army.  Residents of the northwestern counties of Virginia organized a secession from Virginia and entered the Union (with a plan for gradual emancipation) in <a href="a/../1863">1863</a> as <a href="a/../West_Virginia">West Virginia</a>.  
</p><p>The southern half of the federal territory of New Mexico voted to secede, and was accepted into the Confederacy as the Territory of <a href="a/../Arizona">Arizona</a> (not shown on the map), with its capital in Mesilla (now <a href="a/../New_Mexico">New Mexico</a>).  Although <a href="a/../History_of_California#California_and_the_war_Between_the_States">California</a> was a <a href="a/../Free_state">free state</a> and Lincoln had won a plurality there, 28% of its population had voted for the Southern Democrat candidate, <a href="a/../John_C._Breckinridge">John C.

<a name="Origins_of_the_conflict"></a><h2>Origins of the conflict</h2>
<p><i>For details see the main article <a href="a/../Origins_of_the_American_Civil_War">Origins of the American Civil War</a>. See also the <a href="a/../Timeline_of_events_leading_to_the_American_Civil_War">Timeline of events leading to the American Civil War</a>.</i>
</p><p><br />
</p><p>On the eve of the Civil War, the United States was a nation divided into four quite distinct regions: the Northeast, with a growing industrial and commercial economy and an increasing density of population; the Northwest, a rapidly expanding region of free farmers; the Upper South, with a settled plantation system and (in some areas) declining economic fortunes; and the Southwest, a booming frontier-like region with expanding cotton economy. With two fundamentally different labor systems at their base, the economic and social changes across the nation's geographical regions &ndash; based on <a href="a/../Wage">wage</a> labor in the North and on <a href="a/../Slavery">slavery</a> in the South &ndash; underlay distinct visions of society that had emerged by the mid-nineteenth century in the North and in the South.
</p><p>Before the Civil War, the <a href="a/../United_States_Constitution">Constitution</a> provided a basis for peaceful debate over the future of government, and had been able to regulate conflicts of interest and conflicting visions for the new, rapidly expanding nation. For many years, compromises had been made to balance the number of "<a href="a/../Free_state">free states</a>" and "slave states" so that there would be a balance in the Senate. The last slave state admitted was Texas in 1845, with five free states admitted between 1846 and 1859. Kansas's admission as a slave state had recently been blocked, and it was due to enter as a free state instead in 1861. The rise of mass democracy in the industrializing North, the breakdown of the old two-party system, and increasingly virulent and hostile sectional ideologies in the mid-nineteenth century made it highly unlikely, if not impossible, to bring about the gentlemanly compromises of the past (such as the <a href="a/../Missouri_Compromise">Missouri Compromise</a> and the <a href="a/../Compromise_of_1850">Compromise of 1850</a>) necessary to avoid crisis. 
</p><p>Sectional tensions changed in their nature and intensity rapidly during the 1850s. The United States <a href="a/../Republican_Party">Republican Party</a> was established in 1854. The new party opposed the expansion of slavery in the Western territories. Although only a small share of Northerners favored measures to abolish slavery in the South, the Republicans were able to mobilize popular support among Northerners and Westerns who did not want to compete against slave labor if the system were expanded beyond the South. The Republicans won the support of many ex-<a href="a/../United_States_Whig_Party">Whigs</a> and Northern ex-<a href="a/../United_States_Democratic_Party">Democrats</a> concerned about the South's disproportionate influence in the <a href="a/../United_States_Senate">Senate</a>, the <a href="a/../James_Buchanan">Buchanan administration</a>, and the <a href="a/../United_States_Supreme_Court">Supreme Court</a>.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the profitability of cotton, or "King Cotton," as it was touted, solidified the South's dependence on the plantation system and its foundation: slave labor. A small class of slave barons, especially cotton planters, dominated the politics and society of the South.
</p><p>Southern secession was triggered by the election of Republican <a href="a/../Abraham_Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. Lincoln was a moderate in his opposition to slavery. He pledged to do all he could to oppose the expansion of slavery into the territories (thus also preventing the admission of any additional slave states to the Union); but he also said the federal government did not have the power to abolish slavery in the states in which it already existed, and that he would enforce <a href="a/../Fugitive_Slave_Law">Fugitive Slave Laws</a>. The southern states expected increasing hostility to their "peculiar institution"; not trusting Lincoln, and mindful that many other Republicans were intent on complete abolition of slavery. Lincoln had even encouraged <a href="a/../Abolitionism">abolitionists</a> with his 1858 "House divided" speech<a href="javascript:jumpUrl('mth.esuoh/sehceeps/nlocnil/evitaerc/bew/ten.sniten.esacwohs//:ptth');">[1]</a>, though that speech was also consistent with an eventual end of slavery achieved gradually and voluntarily with compensation to slave-owners and resettlement of former slaves. 
</p><p>In addition to Lincoln's presidential victory, the slave states had lost the balance of power in the Senate and were facing a future as a perpetual minority after decades of nearly continuous control of the presidency and the Congress. Southerners also felt they could no longer prevent <a href="a/../Protectionist">protectionist</a> tariffs such as the <a href="a/../Morrill_Tariff">Morrill Tariff</a>, which generally placed a greater burden upon the South.
</p><p>The Southern justification for a unilateral right to secede cited the doctrine of <a href="a/../States%27_rights">states' rights</a>, which had been debated before with the 1798 <a href="a/../Kentucky_and_Virginia_Resolutions">Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions</a>, the <a href="a/../Hartford_Convention">Hartford Convention</a> during the <a href="a/../War_of_1812">War of 1812</a>, and the 1832 <a href="a/../Nullification_Crisis">Nullification Crisis</a> with regard to tariffs.
</p><p>Before Lincoln took office, seven states seceded from the union, establishing a rebel government, the <a href="a/../Confederate_States_of_America">Confederate States of America</a> on <a href="a/../February_9">February 9</a>, <a href="a/../1861">1861</a>. They took control of federal forts and property within their boundaries, with little resistance from President Buchanan. Ironically, by seceding, the rebel states weakened any claim to the territories that were in dispute, cancelled any obligation for the North to return fugitive slaves, and assured easy passage of many bills and amendments they had long opposed. The Civil War began when Confederate General <a href="a/../Pierre_Beauregard">Pierre Beauregard</a> opened fire upon <a href="a/../Fort_Sumter">Fort Sumter</a> in Charleston, South Carolina on <a href="a/../April_12">April 12</a>, <a href="a/../1861">1861</a>.

<p>Lincoln's victory in the <a href="a/../U.S._presidential_election%2C_1860">presidential election of 1860</a> triggered South Carolina's secession from the Union.  Lincoln had not even been on many of the ballots in the South.   Leaders in the state had long been waiting for an event that might  unite the South against the antislavery forces. Once the election returns were certain, a special South Carolina convention declared "that the Union now subsisting between South Carolina and other states under the name of the 'United States of America' is hereby dissolved." By <a href="a/../February_1">February 1</a>, <a href="a/../1861">1861</a>, six more Southern states had seceded. On <a href="a/../February_7">February 7</a>, the seven states adopted a provisional constitution for the Confederate States of America and established their capital at <a href="a/../Montgomery%2C_Alabama">Montgomery, Alabama</a>. The remaining southern states as yet remained in the Union. Several seceding states seized federal forts within their boundaries; President Buchanan made no military response.
</p><p>Less than a month later, on <a href="a/../March_4">March 4</a>, <a href="a/../1861">1861</a>, Abraham Lincoln was sworn in as <a href="a/../President_of_the_United_States">president of the United States</a>. In his <a href="a/../Inauguration">inaugural</a> address, he argued that the Constitution was a <i>more perfect union</i> than the earlier <a href="a/../Articles_of_Confederation">Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union</a>, that it was a binding contract, and called the secession "legally void".  He stated he had no intent to invade southern states, but would use force to maintain possession of federal property. His speech closed with a plea for restoration of the bonds of union.  The South, particularly South Carolina, ignored the plea, and on <a href="a/../April_12">April 12</a>, the South fired upon the Federal troops stationed at <a href="a/../Fort_Sumter">Fort Sumter</a> in <a href="a/../Charleston%2C_South_Carolina">Charleston, South Carolina</a> until the troops surrendered.
</p><p>Lincoln called for all of the states in the Union to send troops to recapture the forts and preserve the Union.  Most Northerners believed that a quick brutal victory for the Union would put out the rebellion, and so Lincoln only called for volunteers for 90 days.  This resulted in four more states voting to secede.  Once Virginia seceded, the Confederate capital was moved to <a href="a/../Richmond%2C_Virginia">Richmond, Virginia</a>.
</p><p>Even though the Southern states had seceded, there was considerable anti-secessionist sentiment within several of the seceding states.  Eastern Tennessee, in particular, was a hotbed for pro-Unionism.  <a href="a/../Winston_County%2C_Alabama">Winston County, Alabama</a> issued a resolution of secession from the state of Alabama. The <i><a href="a/../Red_Strings_%28American_politics%29">Red Strings</a></i> were a prominent Southern anti-secession group.
</p><p><a href="a/../Winfield_Scott">Winfield Scott</a> created the <a href="a/../Anaconda_Plan">Anaconda Plan</a> as the Union's main plan of attack during the war.

<a name="Eastern_Theater_1861.26ndash.3B1863"></a><h3>Eastern Theater 1861&ndash;1863</h3>
<p>As a Confederate force was built up by July 1861 at <a href="a/../Manassas%2C_Virginia">Manassas, Virginia</a>, a march by Union troops under the command of Maj. Gen. <a href="a/../Irvin_McDowell">Irvin McDowell</a> on the Confederate forces there was halted in the <a href="a/../First_Battle_of_Bull_Run">First Battle of Bull Run</a>, or <i>First Manassas</i>, whereupon they were forced back to <a href="a/../Washington%2C_DC">Washington, DC</a> by Confederate troops under the command of Generals <a href="a/../Joseph_E._Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a> and <a href="a/../P.G.T._Beauregard">P.G.T. Beauregard</a>. Alarmed at the loss, and in an attempt to prevent more slave states from leaving the Union, the <a href="a/../Congress_of_the_United_States">U.S. Congress</a> passed the <a href="a/../Crittenden-Johnson_Resolution">Crittenden-Johnson Resolution</a> on <a href="a/../July_25">July 25</a> of that year which stated that the war was being fought to preserve the Union and not to end <a href="a/../Slavery">slavery</a>.  
</p><p>Major General <a href="a/../George_McClellan">George McClellan</a> took command of the Union <a href="a/../Army_of_the_Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a> on <a href="a/../July_26">July 26</a> (he was briefly given supreme command of all the Union armies, but was subsequently relieved of that post in favor of Maj. Gen. <a href="a/../Henry_W._Halleck">Henry W. Halleck</a>), and the war began in earnest in <a href="a/../1862">1862</a>. 
</p><p>Upon the strong urging of President Lincoln to begin offensive operations, McClellan invaded Virginia in the spring of 1862 by way of the peninsula between the <a href="a/../York_River">York River</a> and <a href="a/../James_River">James River</a>, southeast of Richmond. His <a href="a/../Army_of_the_Potomac">Army of the Potomac</a> reached the gates of Richmond in the <a href="a/../Peninsula_Campaign">Peninsula Campaign</a>, but <a href="a/../Robert_E._Lee">Robert E. Lee</a> defeated him in the <a href="a/../Seven_Days_Battles">Seven Days Battles</a> and forced his retreat; he was stripped of many of his troops to reinforce <a href="a/../John_Pope_%28military_officer%29">John Pope</a>'s Union <a href="a/../Army_of_Virginia">Army of Virginia</a>. Pope was beaten spectacularly by Lee at <a href="a/../Second_Bull_Run">Second Bull Run</a> in August.
</p><p>Emboldened by Second Bull Run, the Confederacy made its first invasion of the North, when General Lee led 55,000 men of the <a href="a/../Army_of_Northern_Virginia">Army of Northern Virginia</a> across the <a href="a/../Potomac_River">Potomac River</a> into <a href="a/../Maryland">Maryland</a> on <a href="a/../September_5">September 5</a>. Lincoln then restored Pope's troops to McClellan.  McClellan won a bloody, but inconclusive, victory at the <a href="a/../Battle_of_Antietam">Battle of Antietam</a> near <a href="a/../Sharpsburg%2C_Maryland">Sharpsburg, Maryland</a>, on <a href="a/../September_17">September 17</a>, 1862. Lee's army, checked at last, returned to Virginia before McClellan could destroy it. Antietam is considered a Union victory because it halted Lee's invasion of the North and provided justification for Lincoln to announce his <a href="a/../Emancipation_Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a>.
</p><p>When McClellan failed to follow up on Antietam, he was replaced by Maj. Gen. <a href="a/../Ambrose_Burnside">Ambrose Burnside</a>. Burnside suffered near-immediate defeat at the <a href="a/../Battle_of_Fredericksburg">Battle of Fredericksburg</a>, and was in his turn replaced by Maj. Gen. <a href="a/../Joseph_Hooker">Joseph Hooker</a>. Hooker, too, proved unable to defeat Lee's army, despite possessing twice its numbers, and was humiliated in the <a href="a/../Battle_of_Chancellorsville">Battle of Chancellorsville</a> in May <a href="a/../1863">1863</a>. He was replaced by Maj. Gen. <a href="a/../George_G._Meade">George G. Meade</a> during Lee's second invasion of the North, in June. Meade defeated Lee at the <a href="a/../Battle_of_Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a> (<a href="a/../July_1">July 1</a>&ndash;<a href="a/../July_3">3</a>, 1863), the largest battle in North American history, which is sometimes considered the war's <a href="a/../Turning_Point_of_the_American_Civil_War">turning point</a>. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia suffered 28,000 casualties (versus Meade's 23,000), again forcing it to retreat to Virginia, never to launch a full-scale invasion of the North again.
</p>
<a name="Western_Theater_1861.26ndash.3B1863"></a><h3>Western Theater 1861&ndash;1863</h3>
<p>While the Confederate forces had numerous successes in the Eastern theater, they failed in the West. Confederate forces were driven from Missouri early in the war as result of the <a href="a/../Battle_of_Pea_Ridge">Battle of Pea Ridge</a>. <a href="a/../Leonidas_Polk">Leonidas Polk</a>'s invasion of <a href="a/../Kentucky">Kentucky</a> enraged the citizens who previously had declared neutrality in the war, removing that state from the list of those friendly to the Confederacy.
</p><p><a href="a/../Nashville%2C_Tennessee">Nashville, Tennessee</a> fell to the Union early in 1862. Most of the <a href="a/../Mississippi_River">Mississippi</a> was opened with the taking of <a href="a/../Battle_of_Island_Number_Ten">Island No. 10</a> and <a href="a/../New_Madrid%2C_Missouri">New Madrid, Missouri</a>, and then <a href="a/../Memphis%2C_Tennessee">Memphis, Tennessee</a>. <a href="a/../New_Orleans%2C_Louisiana">New Orleans, Louisiana</a>, was captured in January, 1862, allowing the Union forces to begin moving up the Mississippi as well. Only the fortress city of <a href="a/../Vicksburg%2C_Mississippi">Vicksburg, Mississippi</a> prevented full Union control of the river.
</p><p><a href="a/../Braxton_Bragg">Braxton Bragg</a>'s second Confederate invasion of Kentucky was repulsed at the bloody <a href="a/../Battle_of_Perryville">Battle of Perryville</a> and he was defeated by <a href="a/../William_S._Rosecrans">William S. Rosecrans</a> at the <a href="a/../Battle_of_Stones_River">Battle of Stones River</a> in <a href="a/../Tennessee">Tennessee</a>.
</p><p>The one clear Confederate victory in the West was the <a href="a/../Battle_of_Chickamauga">Battle of Chickamauga</a> in Tennessee, near the <a href="a/../Georgia_%28U.S._state%29">Georgia</a> border, where Bragg, reinforced by the corps of <a href="a/../James_Longstreet">James Longstreet</a> (from Lee's army in the east), defeated Rosecrans and forced him into a siege at Chattanooga.
</p><p>The Union's key strategist and tactician in the west was Maj. Gen. <a href="a/../Ulysses_S._Grant">Ulysses S. Grant</a>, who won victories at <a href="a/../Battle_of_Fort_Henry">Fort Henry</a>, <a href="a/../Battle_of_Fort_Donelson">Fort Donelson</a>, <a href="a/../Battle_of_Shiloh">Shiloh</a>, <a href="a/../Battle_of_Vicksburg">Vicksburg, Mississippi</a>, and <a href="a/../Chattanooga%2C_Tennessee">Chattanooga, Tennessee</a>, driving Confederate forces out of Tennessee.
</p>
<a name="Trans-Mississippi_Theater_1861.26ndash.3B1865"></a><h3>Trans-Mississippi Theater 1861&ndash;1865</h3>
<p>Though geographically isolated from the battles to the east, a number of military actions took place in the Trans-Mississippi theater, a region encompassing states and territories to the west of the Mississippi River. In 1861 Confederates launched a successful campaign into the territory of present day <a href="a/../Arizona">Arizona</a> and <a href="a/../New_Mexico">New Mexico</a>. Residents in the southern portions of this territory adopted a secession ordinance of their own and requested that Confederate forces stationed in nearby <a href="a/../Texas">Texas</a> assist them in removing Union forces still stationed there. The Confederate territory of Arizona was proclaimed by Col. John Baylor after victories at <a href="a/../Mesilla%2C_New_Mexico">Mesilla, New Mexico</a>, and the capture of several union forces. Confederate troops were unsuccessful in attempts to press northward in the territory and withdrew from Arizona completely in 1862 as Union reinforcements arrived from <a href="a/../California">California</a>.
</p><p>The Union mounted several attempts to capture the trans-Mississippi regions of Texas and Louisiana from 1862 until the war's end. With ports to the east under blockade or capture, Texas in particular became a blockade-running haven. Referred to as the "back door" of the Confederacy, Texas and western Louisiana continued to provide cotton crops that were transferred over land to <a href="a/../Matamoros%2C_Mexico">Matamoros, Mexico</a>, and shipped to Europe in exchange for supplies. Determined to close this trade, the Union mounted several invasion attempts of Texas, each of them unsuccessful. Confederate victories at <a href="a/../Galveston%2C_Texas">Galveston, Texas</a>, and the Battle of Sabine Pass  repulsed invasion forces. The Union's disastrous Red River Campaign  in western Louisiana, including a defeat at the <a href="a/../Battle_of_Mansfield">Battle of Mansfield</a>, effectively ended the north's final invasion attempt of the region until the Confederacy's surrender. Isolated from events in the east, the Civil War continued in the Trans-Mississippi theater for several months after Robert E. Lee's surrender. The last battle of the war occurred at <a href="a/../Battle_of_Palmito_Ranch">Palmito Ranch</a> in southern Texas&mdash;ironically a confederate victory.

<a name="Fall_of_the_Confederacy_1864.26ndash.3B1865"></a><h3>Fall of the Confederacy 1864&ndash;1865</h3>
<p><br />
At the beginning of 1864, Grant was promoted to lieutenant general and given command of all Union armies. He chose to make his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac although Meade remained the actual commander of that army. He left Maj. Gen. <a href="a/../William_Tecumseh_Sherman">William Tecumseh Sherman</a> in command of most of the western armies. Grant understood the concept of <a href="a/../Total_war">total war</a> and believed, along with Lincoln and Sherman, that only the utter defeat of Confederate forces and their economic base would bring an end to the war. Therefore, <a href="a/../Scorched_earth">scorched earth</a> tactics would be required in some important theaters. He devised a coordinated strategy that would strike at the heart of Confederacy from multiple directions: Grant, Meade, and <a href="a/../Benjamin_Franklin_Butler_%28politician%29">Benjamin Butler</a> against Lee near Richmond; <a href="a/../Franz_Sigel">Franz Sigel</a> in the <a href="a/../Shenandoah_Valley">Shenandoah Valley</a>; Sherman to invade <a href="a/../Georgia_%28U.S._state%29">Georgia</a>, defeat <a href="a/../Joseph_E._Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a>, and capture <a href="a/../Atlanta">Atlanta</a>; <a href="a/../George_Crook">George Crook</a> and <a href="a/../William_W._Averell">William W. Averell</a> to operate against railroad supply lines in <a href="a/../West_Virginia">West Virginia</a>; <a href="a/../Nathaniel_Prentiss_Banks">Nathaniel Banks</a> to capture <a href="a/../Mobile%2C_Alabama">Mobile, Alabama</a>.
</p><p>Union forces in the East attempted to maneuver past Lee and fought several battles during that phase of the Eastern campaign, known as Grant's <a href="a/../Overland_Campaign">Overland Campaign</a>. An attempt to outflank Lee from the south failed under Butler, who was <i>corked</i> into the <a href="a/../Bermuda_Hundred_Campaign"> Bermuda Hundred</a> river bend. Grant was tenacious and, despite astonishing losses (over 66,000 casualties in six weeks), kept pressing the Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. He pinned down the Confederate army in the <a href="a/../Siege_of_Petersburg">Siege of Petersburg</a>, where the two armies engaged in trench warfare for over nine months.
</p><p>After two failed attempts (under Sigel and <a href="a/../David_Hunter">David Hunter</a>) to seize key points in the Shenandoah Valley, Grant finally found a commander, <a href="a/../Philip_Sheridan">Philip Sheridan</a>, aggressive enough to prevail in the <a href="a/../Valley_Campaigns_of_1864">Valley Campaigns of 1864</a>. Sheridan was sent as a result of a raid by <a href="a/../Jubal_Anderson_Early">Jubal Early</a>, whose corps reached the outer defenses of Washington, scaring the government, before withdrawing back to the Valley. Sheridan defeated Early in a series of battles, decisively at <a href="a/../Battle_of_Cedar_Creek">Cedar Creek</a>, and proceeded to destroy the agricultural and industrial base of the Valley, similar to tactics Sherman would use in Georgia. 
</p><p>Meanwhile, Sherman marched from Chattanooga to Atlanta, <a href="a/../Georgia_%28U.S._state%29">Georgia</a>, defeating Generals <a href="a/../Joseph_E._Johnston">Joseph E. Johnston</a> and <a href="a/../John_B._Hood">John B. Hood</a>. The capture of Atlanta on <a href="a/../September_2">September 2</a>, 1864, was a significant factor in re-electing Abraham Lincoln. Leaving Atlanta, he laid waste to much of the rest of Georgia in what has been called <i><a href="a/../Sherman%27s_March_to_the_Sea">Sherman's March to the Sea</a></i>, reaching the sea at <a href="a/../Savannah%2C_Georgia">Savannah, Georgia</a> in December, 1864. Burning towns and plantations as they went, Sherman's armies hauled off crops and killed livestock to retaliate and to deny use of these economic assets to the Confederacy, a consequence of Grant's scorched earth doctrine. When Sherman turned north through South Carolina and North Carolina to approach the Virginia lines from the south, it was the end for Lee and his men, and for the Confederacy.
</p><p>Lee attempted to escape from Petersburg and link up with Johnston in <a href="a/../North_Carolina">North Carolina</a>, but he was overtaken by Grant. He surrendered his Army of Northern Virginia on <a href="a/../April_9">April 9</a>, <a href="a/../1865">1865</a>, at <a href="a/../Appomattox_Court_House">Appomattox Court House</a>. Johnston surrendered his troops to Sherman shortly thereafter. The <a href="a/../Battle_of_Palmito_Ranch">Battle of Palmito Ranch</a>, fought on <a href="a/../May_13">May 13</a>, 1865, in the far south of <a href="a/../Texas">Texas</a>, was the last land battle of the war and ended, ironically, with a Confederate victory. All Confederate land forces surrendered by June 1865.  Confederate naval units surrendered as late as November 1865.
</p>
<a name="Reasons_for_the_Outcome"></a><h2> Reasons for the Outcome </h2>
<p>Why the Union prevailed (or why the Confederacy was defeated) in the Civil War has been a subject of extensive analysis and debate.  Advantages widely believed to have contributed to the Union's success include:
</p>
<ul><li>The more industrialized economy of the North, which aided in the production of arms and munitions.
</li><li>Strong compatible railroad links between Union cities, which allowed for the relatively quick movement of troops. (It should be noted, however, that the Confederacy had more railroads per capita than any other country at the time.)
</li><li>The Union's larger population and greater immigration during the war, allowing for a larger pool of potential recruits.
</li><li>The Union's possession of the U.S. <a href="a/../Merchant_marine">merchant marine</a> fleet and <a href="a/../Naval_ship">naval ships</a>, which led to its successful blockade of Confederate ports.
</li><li>The Union's more established government, which may have resulted in less infighting and a more streamlined conducting of the war.
</li><li>The moral cause assigned to the war by the <a href="a/../Emancipation_Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a>, which may have given the Union additional incentive to continue the war effort, and also may have encouraged international support.
</li><li>The recruitment of African-Americans, including many freed slaves, into the Union Army after the Emancipation Proclamation took effect. In the final weeks of the war, the Confederacy relented and began to allow blacks to enlist in the army, but this was only a token effort.
</li><li>The Confederacy's possible squandering of resources on early conventional offensives and its <a href="javascript:jumpUrl('18579387_ia/41_1_si/YZH0m_im/selcitra/p/moc.selcitradnif.www//:ptth');">failure</a> to fully use its advantages in non-conventional warfare against Union communication and transportation infrastructure.
</li><li>The Confederacy's failure to win military support from any foreign power.

<a name="Aftermath"></a><h2>Aftermath</h2>
<p>As slavery and constitutional questions concerning states' rights were widely viewed as causes for the war, the victorious Union government sought to end slavery and to strip the states of their powers to define citizenship and to deny residents fundamental rights.  
</p><p>During the early part of the war, Lincoln, to hold together his war coalition of Republicans and War Democrats, emphasized preservation of the Union as the sole Union objective of the war, but with the <a href="a/../Emancipation_Proclamation">Emancipation Proclamation</a>, announced in September 1862 and put into effect four months later, Lincoln adopted the abolition of slavery as a second mission. The Emancipation Proclamation declared all slaves held in territory then under Confederate control  to be "then, thenceforth, and forever free." It had little initial effect but served to commit the United States to the goal of ending slavery. The Proclamation would be put into practical effect in Confederate territory captured over the remainder of the war.   
</p><p>The border States of Missouri and Maryland moved during the course of the war to end slavery, and in December 1864, the Congress proposed the 13th Amendment to the United States Constitution, barring slavery throughout the United States; the 13th Amendment was fully ratified by the end of 1865.  The <a href="a/../Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">14th Amendment</a>, defining citizenship and giving the Federal government broad power to require the States to provide equal protection of the laws was adopted in 1868.  The <a href="a/../Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution">15th Amendment</a> guaranteeing black Americans the right to vote was ratified in 1870.  The 14th and 15th Amendments reversed the effects of the Supreme Court's <a href="a/../Dred_Scott">Dred Scott</a> decision of 1857, but the 14th Amendment, in particular, had unanticipated and far-reaching effects.  
</p><p>The expansion of "fundamental rights" under the 14th Amendment's first clause, requiring due process and equal protection for all citizens was not anticipated by its sponsors. Yet under this clause the <a href="a/../Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States">Supreme Court</a> has recognized such rights as the right to <a href="a/../Abortion">abortion</a>, the right to <a href="a/../Birth_control">contraceptives</a>, the right to <a href="a/../Medicine">medical treatment</a>, and the right to <a href="a/../Marriage">marry</a>.
</p><p>According to data from the <a href="a/../United_States_Department_of_Veterans_Affairs">United States Department of Veterans Affairs</a>, the last surviving Union veteran of the conflict, <a href="a/../Albert_Woolson">Albert Woolson</a>, died on <a href="a/../August_2">August 2</a>, <a href="a/../1956">1956</a> at the age of 109, and the last Confederate veteran, John Salling, died on <a href="a/../March_16">March 16</a>, <a href="a/../1958">1958</a>, at the age of 112. However, William Marvel investigated the claims of both for a 1991 piece in the Civil War history magazine <i>Blue &amp; Gray</i>. Using census information, he found that Salling was born in 1858, far too late to have served in the Civil War. In fact, he concluded, "Every one of the last dozen recognized Confederates was bogus." He found Woolson to be the last true veteran of the Civil War on either side; he had served as a drummer boy late in the war.
</p><p>After the war, the <a href="a/../Grand_Army_of_the_Republic">Grand Army of the Republic</a>, a fraternal organization open to Union war veterans, was founded in <a href="a/../1866">1866</a>.  Confederate veterans formed the <a href="a/../United_Confederate_Veterans">United Confederate Veterans</a> in <a href="a/../1889">1889</a>. In <a href="a/../1905">1905</a>, a campaign medal was authorized for all Civil War veterans, known as the <a href="a/../Civil_War_Campaign_Medal">Civil War Campaign Medal</a>.
</p><p>Many of the Union military leaders, such as <a href="a/../Sheridan">Sheridan</a>, Sherman, and <a href="a/../Custer">Custer</a> would take the concept of <a href="a/../Scorched_earth">scorched earth</a> and apply it to the <a href="a/../Indian_Wars">Indian Wars</a> on the <a href="a/../Great_Plains">Great Plains</a>, which resulted in <a href="a/../Ethnic_cleansing">ethnic cleansing</a> and attempted <a href="a/../Genocide">genocide</a>.
</p><p>From the <a href="a/../U.S._presidential_election%2C_1876">election of 1876</a> until the <a href="a/../U.S._presidential_election%2C_1964">election of 1964</a>, <a href="a/../Georgia_%28U.S._State%29">Georgia</a>, <a href="a/../Alabama">Alabama</a>, <a href="a/../Mississippi">Mississippi</a>, and <a href="a/../Arkansas">Arkansas</a> <a href="a/../U.S._presidential_election_maps">gave no electoral votes</a> to the <a href="a/../Republican_Party_%28United_States%29">Republican Party</a>, with <a href="a/../South_Carolina">South Carolina</a> and <a href="a/../Louisiana">Louisiana</a> making an exception only once each.  Most other states that had seceded voted overwhelmingly against Republican presidential nominees also, with the same trend predominantly applying in state elections too. This phenomenon was known as the <a href="a/../Solid_South">Solid South</a>. However, starting with the election of 1964, this trend has almost completely reversed, and most of the Southern states have now become Republican strongholds.
</p><p>A good deal of ill will among the Southern survivors resulted from the consequent shift of <a href="a/../Political_power">political power</a> to the North, the destruction inflicted on the South by the Union armies as the end of the war approached, and the <a href="a/../Reconstruction">Reconstruction</a> program instituted in the South by the Union after the war's end. Bitterness about the war continued for decades after the war ended, and many southerners still do not accept the outcome. Cars with bumper stickers that say "The South shall rise again" are sometimes seen.  It is not uncommon to see a <a href="a/../Confederate_Flag">Confederate Flag</a> flying in various parts of the South.  Heated political debates still occur over the use of symbols like Confederate Flags and images of Lincoln in public life. When asked, the flag's proponents argue that it does not signify any type of prejudice or <a href="a/../Racism">racism</a>, but is instead a symbol of the bond the southern states share; others, especially blacks, disagree.
