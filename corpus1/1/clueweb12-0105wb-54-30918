      <h1><span class="main_heading">Dark Chocolate</span></h1>Dark chocolate can be described as chocolate, which is made without any milk solids being added to it. It can also be referred to as semisweet chocolate or bittersweet chocolate. Because it is devoid of milk solids, dark chocolate has a taste that is a lot more pronounced than milk chocolate does. The absence of milk additives could also be one of the reasons that at times, dark chocolate could have a dry and chalky texture, along with a bitter aftertaste. Despite the unique taste and texture that dark chocolate has, or perhaps even because of it, there are several people enjoy eating it.<br><br><script type="text/javascript"><!--

</script><br> In fact, there are many people who prefer eating dark chocolate to regular milk chocolate, because it is not overly sweet. <p>The main ingredients that are used to make dark chocolate include cacao beans, soy lecithin (which is an emulsifier that preserves its texture), sugar and at times, some type of flavoring, like mint or vanilla for example. Chocolate connoisseurs and manufacturers usually distinguish dark chocolate by its cocoa solid percentage.<br><br><script type="text/javascript"><!--

Though rare, it is also possible to get 80% or perhaps even 90% dark chocolate, which is usually very bitter in taste.<br><br><script type="text/javascript"><!--

</script><br> This could be mainly due to the fact that good quality <strong>dark chocolate</strong> consists of flavonoids, which reduce the risks of certain medical conditions, such as strokes or even heart attacks. Moreover, the presence of flavonoids in chocolate stimulates the production of nitric oxide in the body, which in turn, relaxes the muscles that are around the blood vessels, reducing the risks of blood pressure problems. Moreover, studies also indicate that eating dark chocolate can help improve a person&rsquo;s mood to a great extent. Because of this, the consumption of dark chocolate may also be suggested for people who are prone to depression. Dark chocolate increases the levels of hormones, known as endorphins, in the human body. It is the brain that releases these endorphins. These endorphins can also be referred to, as natural antidepressants, as they have the ability to bring about a positive change in a person&rsquo;s mood. One of the main factors that can lead to depression in a person is the imbalance of a substance known as serotonin. Eating up to one ounce of dark chocolate each day is known to increase the levels of serotonin in the body to a great extent, thereby reducing the risks of depression, mood swings and other negative emotions. If the chocolate is consumed during the early part of the day, preferably in the morning, it also has the ability of increasing the levels of energy in the body. </p><p>There are hundreds of weight watchers who claim that they would give anything, just to be able to indulge in a small amount of chocolate regularly and still lose weight. Fortunately, it is quite possible for them to do exactly that. Not a lot of people are aware of the fact that one of the most common <strong>dark chocolate health benefits</strong> is weight loss, which is why many dieticians advise people to satiate any sweet cravings that they may experience, with nothing but a small quantity of dark chocolate on an occasional basis. Chocolate is made out of cocoa, which can help decrease a person&rsquo;s appetite. Moreover, after eating sweets people are likely to want more, but since dark chocolate contains small amounts of sugar, it does not really trigger off any more sweet cravings. This is probably why many diet product manufacturers have begun adding cocoa to their weight loss products. Moreover some of the leading causes of obesity include a slow metabolism and the lack of adequate physical activity. Studies indicate that chocolate can change a person&rsquo;s metabolism and increase the levels of energy, allowing a person to feel more active. </p><p>One of the most important <strong>dark chocolate health benefits</strong> for women, as well as men, is that it helps delay the aging process.&nbsp; <br /></p><h3><span class="sub_heading">Dark chocolate recipes<br /></span></h3><p>Dark <a href="http://www.diethealthclub.com/chocolate.html"><strong>chocolate</strong></a> can also be used in the preparation of many types of desserts. It is quite easy to get several different <strong>dark chocolate recipes</strong> from books, or online resources. Given below is an example of a recipe made using dark chocolate: </p><p>Dark chocolate cupcake recipe</p><p>&bull;&nbsp;8 Tablespoons of unsalted butter<br />&bull;&nbsp;2 ounces bitter chocolate <br />&bull;&nbsp;2 large eggs<br />&bull;&nbsp;&frac12; cup cocoa powder <br />&bull;&nbsp;&frac12; cup cream <br />&bull;&nbsp;&frac34; cup flour <br />&bull;&nbsp;&frac34; cup sugar <br />&bull;&nbsp;1 teaspoon vanilla extract<br />&bull;&nbsp;&frac34; teaspoon baking powder <br />&bull;&nbsp;&frac12; teaspoon baking soda<br />&bull;&nbsp;&frac12; teaspoon salt</p><p>Method </p><p>&bull;&nbsp;Preheat an oven to 350 degrees and keep a muffin pan ready, with baking cup liners <br />&bull;&nbsp;In a heatproof bowl, add the butter, chocolate and cocoa and melt them together, using a double boiler. Whisk the ingredients till they form a smooth mixture, then setting them aside for a while<br />&bull;&nbsp;In the second bowl, combine the flour, baking powder and baking soda <br />&bull;&nbsp;In the third bowl, whisk the eggs, adding vanilla, sugar and salt to it, whisking all the ingredients thoroughly <br />&bull;&nbsp;Add the melted chocolate mixture to the eggs and blend all the ingredients well, before adding the cream to the mixture too. Finally the flour should be added to the chocolate, so that a smooth and thick batter can be made. <br />&bull;&nbsp;Place some of the batter in each of the muffin cups before baking it for around 18 to 20 minutes. </p><p>However, it is important for all people to realize that too much of any food item could trigger off adverse side effects in the body. Therefore, eating an excess of even the <strong>best dark chocolate</strong> could have a harmful effect on the body. Moreover, people who are diabetic, or suffer from any other preexisting medical condition should consult a doctor and get a go ahead before adding dark chocolate to their regular diet. The daily recommended doses of dark chocolate may vary from one person to the other, based on factors such as age, medical history, physical fitness levels and so on. Therefore, it is also important for people to check with a doctor for the amount of dark chocolate that can be consumed on a regular basis or on certain occasions. </p></td>
