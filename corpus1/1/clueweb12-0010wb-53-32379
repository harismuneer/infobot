        <p><em><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Wicker Man is a remarkable 
          story of the duality between the Christian and pagan ways, set against 
          a Scottish background. In recent years, the story of the movie itself 
          has been used as the struggle between the old Christian establishment 
          and the reintroduction into Western society of &#8220;pagan movies&#8221;, 
          of which The Wicker Man was one of the most shining examples. </font></em>

        <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="twm_04.jpg" width="500" height="320" hspace="10" align="right">Most 
          film-buffs will know The Wicker Man for an early appearance of Britt 
          Ekland. In essence, it is nothing more than a B-movie, produced in 1973. 
          But over the past thirty years, the film has grown in cult appeal, with 
          film fans debating which cut has what, who made it, why, when, etc. 
          Pub quiz knowledge aside, The Wicker Man is memorable for it depicts 
          a Scottish island, Summerisle, which has returned to the old pagan religion, 
          abandoning Christianity. When its crop of apples fails in the summer 
          of 1972, it lures a Christian policeman to the island, to sacrifice 
          him to the solar deity, to appease them, so that the crops will be successful 
          in the summer of 1973. </font>
        <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          Wicker Man began life in 1972 when actor Christopher Lee, Peter Snell 
          (head of the film company British Lion) and writer Anthony Shaffer played 
          with the idea to turn the book Ritual by David Pinner (1967) into a 
          screenplay. Though the rights were purchased, the book lacked cinematographic 
          impact. An old associate of Shaffer, director Robin Hardy, brainstormed 
          new ideas that in the end would form the framework for the finished 
          movie. The main source that was used to reconstruct the old pagan world 
          was Sir James George Frazer's The Golden Bough, a compendium of the 
          rituals of yesteryears.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                result was the story of a devoutly religious police sergeant who 
                is confronted with the old pagan beliefs of the locals on the 
                Summer Isles, on the west coast of Scotland. Standard pagan imagery 
                is depicted throughout the movie: children at school learn ancient 
                medicine&#8230; or should that be sorcery; the religious festivals 
                are those of the Maypole, with children being taught it represents 
                the phallus. The community drinks in The Green Man Inn, while 
                outside, couples have no shame or dance around the fire amidst 
                Stonehenge replicas. Police sergeant Howie might find the scenes 
                he has to witness despicable, but they have transformed Summerisle 
                from a rundown community to a society where apples are grown &#8211; 
                a virtual impossibility in the harsh settings of the Hebridean 
                islands.<br>
                <img src="twm_wickerman.jpg" width="225" height="311" hspace="10" vspace="4" align="left"> 
                The central story is that of police officer Howie, who comes to 
                the Isle of Apples &#8211; Avalon &#8211; in search of the mysterious 
                disappearance of a schoolgirl, Rowan Morrison. Unaware that he 
                is being manipulated by the local population, he eventually learns 
                he has been a fool&#8230; and will suffer the fool&#8217;s fate: 
                he will be sacrificed, in his role as king (representative of 
                the law), fool (which he clearly is) and virgin (he is reserving 
                sexual activity until he is married). In the role of king, he 
                is the substitute of the true power of the islands, Lord Summerisle. 
                Howie himself, now aware of the fate that will befall him, prophesizes 
                that if this year the crops will fail again, a substitute will 
                no longer suffice and the king himself will have to make the final 
                sacrifice himself. That sacrifice is his burning to death, inside 
                the Wicker Man. With his sacrifice to the pagan god, Howie now 
                becomes like Christ, his example, himself: he is sacrificed for 
                the goods of Mankind &#8211; the people of the Earth. </font></p> 
              <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A 
                Wicker Man was indeed used to offer sacrifices to the gods. The 
                victims were animals and humans, the latter often prisoners, taken 
                during wars or convicts found guilty of a crime deserving death. 
                The origin of human sacrifice is almost certainly Caesar's account 
                of the druids in his Gallic Wars. Caesar describes a ritual in 
                which large, compartmentalized wicker effigies were filled with 
                grains, small animals, and even human slaves, before being burned 
                as sacrifices. <br>
          The burning of effigies is one of the oldest and most widespread forms 
          of pagan (and indeed human) worship. The burning of flags and effigies 
          of political leaders continues to be seen on our television screens. 
          The burning of a human effigy is intended to create a spirit messenger: 
          the forge a link between the celebrant and the powers that are normally 
          beyond their control; burning the flag of a country is a symbolism of 
          those who burn that they want to have power over the leaders of the 
          country whose flag they burn. <br>
          In antiquity, the energy of fire was connected with the sun, the bringer 
          of light, often the image with whom god was identified; for some it 
          was the fire of inner change and transformation, the quest for knowledge 
          and power. Frazier saw the fire festival as a rite of purification, 
          which is largely what the events on Summerisle are: a cleansing, in 
          which the people of the island restate their allegiance to &#8220;the 
          powers&#8221;. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          most important fire festivals of Old Europe were held in conjunction 
          with the turning points of the solar year: Midsummer, Winter Solstice, 
          the Spring and Autumn Equinoxes. May Day is an intercalendrical date 
          that is known for its fire festival, which was used for the purpose 
          of the film. <br>
          The fire festivals use fire to fulfil the symbolic functions that mirror 
          the effects of the sun; in particular, they focus on fertilization and 
          growth. Leaping the bonfire (and, in the process, exposing one's reproductive 
          organs to its flame) is widely held to promote fertility, as can also 
          be seen in the movie. </font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="twm_01.jpg" width="437" height="267" hspace="10" align="right">The 
          pagan details are what made the movie an underground favourite. Stories 
          that the movie had been forbidden or deliberately lost still circulate 
          in certain circles. Despite its low budget approach, it had the backing 
          of Christopher Lee from the outset. The film was also Lee&#8217;s attempt 
          to break out of the Hammer Dracula cycle that had become his on screen 
          identity. Ingrid Pitt, a veteran of British horror, was signed on for 
          the role of keeper of the island's records office, while the role of 
          Sgt. Neil Howie went to Edward Woodward, at the time a popular character 
          on television&#8217;s Callan. Diane Cilento (ex-Mrs. Sean Connery, later 
          Mrs. Anthony Shaffer, the film&#8217;s director) was persuaded out of 
          semi-retirement for the important part of the island's school teacher, 
          Miss Rose, the woman who is identified as the source of all corruption 
          on the island. Britt Ekland was chosen as the innkeeper's daughter, 
          Willow, to secure American interest. The fact that she could not produce 
          a reasonable Scottish accent forced all of Ekland&#8217;s dialogue to 
          be dubbed in post-production.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Filming 
          lasted for eight weeks, occurring in late autumn 1972. Autumn was turned 
          into summer by using fake plastic apple trees and decorating the bare 
          trees with fake blossom. Most of the shooting occurred around the film's 
          base of Newton Stewart, Scotland &#8211; none of the filming actually 
          occurred on an island. One location used was Castle Kennedy, the grounds 
          used for the scenes involving the stone circle and the May day procession.

        <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dumfries 
          and Galloway is known for its old megalithic remains &#8211; many to 
          the south of Newton Stewart. The cave and beach scenes were filmed near 
          St Ninian's Cave, a site linked with the first Christian hermit who 
          came to the area to preach Christianity in the mid 5th century. However, 
          all locations linked with St Ninian are ancient pagan sites, which the 
          saint claimed for Christianity. The cave contains seven crosses scratched 
          on the stone, possibly dating from the 6th or 7th century AD. The cave 
          itself is not very deep and the interior cave scenes in the movie were 
          filmed elsewhere, in a cave near Stranraer.<br>
          The movie&#8217;s interest in ancient lore is so detailed that during 
          the opening scenes, there is even imagery of the Old Man of Storr, on 
          the Isle of Skye &#8211; a magical location, whose name betrays its 
          ancient religious importance. The finale of the movie occurs on Burrow 
          Head itself, nestled between St Ninian&#8217;s chapel and St Ninian&#8217;s 
          cave, the southernmost point of &#8220;the Isle of Whithorn&#8221;. 
          Down a small track on the edge of the Hoseasons Caravan site are the 
          remains of the legs of the Wicker Man, set in a concrete base.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
          distributor initially refused to release the film, even in Britain, 
          maintaining that it had no market value whatsoever. As Howie himself 
          stated in the movie: Britain was in name still a Christian country&#8230; 
          the quaint exploits of the people of a strange Scottish island were 
          not believed to appeal to the British cinema goer. <br>
          <img src="twm_02.jpg" width="368" height="204" hspace="10" vspace="4" align="right">However, the movie was 
          made, and money had to be recuperated. The film was entered in the non-competition 
          section of the Cannes Film Festival that year, complete with a huge 
          wicker man prop erected outside the main hotel. The movie was then offered 
          for an American distribution, who requesting shortening the movie. Despite 
          these modifications, the film wasn't secured for an American release. 
          A sum of 200,000 dollars was offered by another distributor, but they 
          went bankrupt four days after the contract was signed. The rights then 
          passed to Warner Brothers, who tested the film in certain areas of the 
          US, but eventually decided not to release it nationally. In the UK, 
          the film was released in December 1973, with Christopher Lee apparently 
          telephoning all the film critics that he knew, begging them to attend 
          the film and even offering to pay for their seats. . It almost seemed 
          as if the movie itself needed a sacrifice so that its fortune would 
          change.</font></p>
        <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Over 
          the following years, the film's reputation grew, particularly in America. 
          It was eventually released in America in January 1979, where it became 
          a huge success. It appeared on television numerous times, despite some 
          public opinion that broadcasters were against the film&#8217;s airings. 
          In November 1998, the BBC even made a documentary on the appeal of the 
          movie, which has resulted in the publication of fanzines. For some, 
          the appeal of the Wicker Man is as magical. But what else should one 
          expect from a movie that is about magic? </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Review 
                of 2006 edition:</strong></font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The 
                Wicker Man received in 2006 a &#8220;Hollywood makeover&#8221;. 
                In 2005, Robin Hardy, the original director of The Wicker Man, 
                had called in his lawyers to have his name taken off promotional 
                material: &quot;The amazing thing is that all the publicity keeps 
                on saying that I have written the screenplay, which is obviously 
                not true,&quot; said Hardy, who did not even take a writing credit 
                on the original, though he worked closely with writer Anthony 
                Shaffer. <br>
                He was at the time also worried about some of the rewrites to 
                the storyline. In the original, Woodward's character, the police 
                inspector to be burnt, was a virgin, making him ideal for sacrifice. 
                That element was ditched from the remake, because it was thought 
                that while audiences would accept the idea of an American community 
                that practised human sacrifice, the idea of a grown-up virgin 
                was apparently too farfetched. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><img src="wicker_06_1.jpg" width="425" height="300" hspace="10" align="left">The 
                remake of &#8220;The Wicker Man&#8221; did not have any advance 
                press screenings. Such evasion techniques normally do not bode 
                well &#8211; and unfortunately, the early calls of scepticism 
                from the likes of Hardy proved all too true. <br>
                At first, you wonder whether this is a remake or a liberal interpretation 
                of the original movie. Nicolas Cage turns out to be a California 
                Highway Patrolman, Edward Malus, who sees a mother and her daughter 
                killed in a car crash, though no bodies are retrieved. It leaves 
                him shaken and incapable to work. In the original edition, there 
                was a prologue too, but this was cut from the actual release. 
                The prologue was there to show that the police officer was a devout, 
                fundamental Catholic. But in the remake, there really is no clear 
                reason why Cage should be involved in this enigmatic accident, 
                which the scriptwriter obviously never had to explain during the 
                production process as to how it fit in the plot and the editor 
                seemed unable to cut it out because of the expense gone into the 
                special effects. At a time when the United States are, apart from 
                controversial international politics, particularly known for being 
                a hotbed of extreme and ultra-conservative Christianity, surely 
                leaving the original stand-off between Christianity and paganism 
                intact would have been a better choice? If The Da Vinci Code showed 
                anything, it is that&#8230; Or was it deemed to be too controversial? 
                <br>
                Cage then travels to a remote island commune in Washington to 
                locate the missing daughter of his ex-fianc&eacute;. There he 
                discovers a matriarchy of pagans who indulge in human sacrifice 
                to ensure the fertility of their harvest. You can see the differences, 
                as well as the resemblances to the 1973 version. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                The American adaptation was done by the controversial playwright/filmmaker 
                Neil LaBute, who moved the island of neo-Druids from Scotland 
                to somewhere off the coast of Washington (which works), and has 
                it run entirely by women, casting Ellen Burstyn as the Queen Bee, 
                with a few men existing as eunuch-servants. The inclusion of beekeeping 
                was a nice, highly symbolic element, with honey replacing apples 
                as the main product upon which the island economy drives &#8211; 
                but it is too little to make the movie work.<br>
                Though the finale is retained for the update, the soul-smashing, 
                faith-crushing impact it is supposed to have amounts to nothing 
                more than just another modern-movie &#8220;twist ending.&#8221; 
                The theatrical release had a &#8220;six months later&#8221; epilogue, 
                which was the ultimate insult to the intelligence of even the 
                most stupid of cinema goers and destroyed any of the believability 
                of the material it may have had with some. If it shows anything, 
                it is that LaBute seems to think every person going to a movie 
                has absolutely no intelligence whatsoever&#8230; fortunately, 
                it was dropped for the DVD release.</font></p>

                The original edition was notorious for its situational humour 
                and contrast between the police officer who tries to find his 
                feet but is slowly slipping down the slope of madness. Some attempt 
                is made by Cage, waving his badge around like he has jurisdiction, 
                flailing his arms around angrily, shouting at women and children 
                alike and even pulling his gun on them, but you wonder whether 
                Cage actually &#8220;got it&#8221; as to what he was meant to 
                portray. So it&#8217;s difficult to say whether it is bad acting 
                or bad screenwriting&#8230; but the end result is just not there 
                when compared with the original edition. As a remake, it left 
                out the positives of the original and was either unable or forgot 
                to replace them with something else. Unremarkably, the movie was 
                </font> <font size="-1" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">nominated 
                for five 2006 Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst Picture, Worst Actor 
                (Nicolas Cage), Worst Screenplay, Worst Remake or Rip-off and 
                Worst Screen Couple (Nicolas Cage and His Bear Suit). Remarkably, 
                like the original edition, the movie garnered a cult following 
                as an unintentional comedy, with several scenes being posted on 
                YouTube boasting repeated shots of Nicholas Cage brutalizing various 
                women throughout the film.</font></p>
