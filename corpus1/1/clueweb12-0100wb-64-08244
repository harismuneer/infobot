						BRUNSWICK — At 10 p.m. today, the lights at 
						Brunswick Naval Air Station’s airfield will be 
						drawn up to their maximum brightness. Then, light 
						by light, the airfield will go black.<br>
						<br>
						The silent display will signal the official end of 
						more than a half century of military airfield 
						operations in Brunswick.<br>
						<br>
						The closure of the base airport — which consists of 
						twin 8,000-foot runways and a control tower built 
						in 2006, among other things — is another step in 
						the incremental shutdown of the 3,200-acre base 
						property. By May 2011, the entire base is scheduled 
						to be closed as an active duty military 
						installation.<br>
						<br>
						“This is probably, up to this point, the most 
						visible symbol of our closing”,Capt. William 
						Fitzgerald, commanding officer of Brunswick Naval 
						Air Station, told The Times Record on Thursday. 
						“Even the squadrons coming and going, that was 
						always happening. Even recently, we still had some 
						planes taking off and landing here. But when you 
						finally shut down the light and put the Xs on the 
						runways, it’s a big milestone. There will be no 
						more planes.”<br>
						<br>
						Cmdr. David Ivezic is the head of the base’s air 
						operations department, and also a pilot.<br>
						<br>
						“I’ve been to the airports in Wiscasset and 
						Bowdoinham, and I’ve talked to a lot of pilots in 
						the community. I’m getting the sense that, ‘Wow, 
						this is going to be a big loss’, Ivezic said. “This 
						is going to leave a big hole in the aviation 
						community.”<br>
						<br>
						Ivezic said that while final decisions haven’t been 
						made, the most junior member of his air operations 
						staff will likely turn the lights off for the last 
						time, while the most senior member of the crew will 
						broadcast the airfield’s last transmission. Both 
						jobs will be performed from the top of the 
						130-foot-tall control tower, which overlooks the 
						runways from the western edge of the base property.<br>
						<br>
						“It’s kind of a ceremonial thing,…; Ivezic said. 
						“We’ll bring it up to the max lights — get the 
						place lit up like a big Christmas tree — and then 
						shut them down.”<br>
						<br>
						What will the last transmission sound like? Air 
						Controlman 1st Class Keith Piccirello, who was one 
						of two sailors manning the control tower Wednesday 
						morning, said that will be determined by whoever is 
						ultimately chosen to give the transmission.<br>
						<br>
						“It’ll be up to him what he wants to say,…; said 
						Piccirello. “(Maybe he will say,) ‘This is the last 
						transmission from Naval Air Station Brunswick.’ 
						Then he’ll have to hand over control of the air 
						space to Portland.<br>
						<br>
						Ivezic said the Federal Aviation Administration 
						will maintain the Brunswick control tower after the 
						Navy ceases use of its aviation facilities, but 
						said air traffic control duties would be performed 
						remotely using the equipment at Portland 
						International Jetport.<br>
						<br>
						Fitzgerald said the process of shutting down the 
						base airfield began more than 10 months ago.&nbsp;<br>
						<br>
						“It will no longer be NAS Brunswick air space, and 
						all that has to be accounted for,…; he said. 
						“Memorandums of agreement for different air space 
						areas had to be canceled out. ... It may seem easy 
						at the end to just turn off the lights, but an 
						awful lot of stuff had to happen to get us there.”<br>
						<br>
						With the airfield shut down, Ivezic’s crews will 
						spend their time packing up aviation-related 
						equipment and shipping it to other military bases 
						or federal organizations for use. Some of the 
						equipment, he said, will stay in Brunswick to be 
						used by civilians hoping to take over airport 
						operations in the coming months.<br>
						<br>
						In the case of a permanent closure, Ivezic said, 
						the numbers and markings on the runways are 
						generally gouged out of the asphalt. However, 
						anticipating a transfer of the airfield property to 
						civilian redevelopers, he said the Navy will place 
						temporary yellow X marks instead. The X marks are 
						about 10-feet-by-60-feet, and are light material 
						that will be weighed down by cinder blocks or other 
						heavy objects.<br>
						<br>
						“We are not going to damage the runways or their 
						numbers in any way”, he said.<br>
						<br>
						The Midcoast Regional Redevelopment Authority, the 
						organization in charge of guiding the civilian 
						reuse of the base, expects to assume control of 850 
						acres associated with the airfield by late August 
						or early September to open a civilian airport 
						there. The new airport will focus on housing 
						private airplanes and aircraft maintenance, repair 
						and overhaul businesses, not passenger or freight 
						service.<br>
						<br>
						But that will be after as many as nine months of 
						darkness at the airfield and decades of very 
						different uses.<br>
						<br>
						“In 1943, the base was initially established, and 
						from training Canadian and British pilots for World 
						War II, to all the things this base has meant to 
						the Cold War and protecting the Northeast Corridor, 
						Fitzgerald said, “it’s quite a legacy this base has 
						had.”</span></p>

						USS CARL VINSON, At Sea (NNS) -- The Nimitz-class 
						aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson (CVN 70) departed 
						the waters near Port-au-Prince, Haiti Feb. 1 after 
						rendering humanitarian assistance to the victims of 
						a massive 7.0 earthquake that struck the Caribbean 
						nation Jan. 12. <br>
						<br>
						Arriving on station less than 72 hours after the 
						quake, Carl Vinson immediately rendered assistance. 
						Over two weeks, Vinson and its embarked 19 
						helicopters flew more than 2,200 sorties, 
						delivering more than 166 tons of food, 89,000 
						gallons of water and 38,700 lbs. of medical 
						supplies to earthquake victims.<br>
						<br>
						Additionally, Vinson's helicopters conducted 476 
						medical evacuations (MEDEVACs) and the ship's 
						doctors and corpsmen treated 60 patients in its 
						medical ward. <br>
						<br>
						&quot;I think our Navy team did some great work here for 
						the people of Haiti,&quot; Carl Vinson Carrier Strike 
						Group Commander Rear. Adm. Ted Branch said. <br>
						<br>
						Carl Vinson's primary role in the humanitarian 
						mission was as a first responder, providing 
						critical airlift and command and control 
						capabilities as the flagship of Task Force 41, the 
						Navy's sea base supporting Joint Task Force (JTF) 
						Haiti. <br>
						<br>
						Prior to departure, the Vinson left behind much of 
						its airlift capability, transferring 10 helicopters 
						to other units in JTF-Haiti. Additionally, the 
						improvement of the relief distribution effort on 
						the ground, in partnership with the Haiti 
						government, the United Nations, the international 
						community, and supporting organizations have 
						reduced the need of the ship's first responder 
						role.<br>
						<br>
						With the departure of Carl Vinson, Rear Adm. Dave 
						Thomas assumes command of Task Force 41 (CTF 41), 
						the U.S. Navy's sea-based element supporting JTF-Haiti. 
						Thomas is embarked aboard the task force's 
						flagship, the amphibious assault ship USS Bataan (LHD 
						5).<br>
						<br>
						The Bataan Amphibious Ready Group, with elements of 
						the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU), are 
						specially configured for sustained humanitarian 
						assistance missions, including air and sealift 
						capabilities, medical and engineering support and 
						water purification.<br>
						<br>
						While in support of Operation Unified Response, 
						Vinson Sailors saw firsthand the results of their 
						work in support of the Haitian people.<br>
						<br>
						&quot;Every one of my Sailors wanted to go ashore to 
						help,&quot; said Carl Vinson Commanding Officer Capt. 
						Bruce Lindsey. &quot;It was inspiring to see such an 
						outpouring of volunteerism. America should be very 
						proud of the Sailors that they have serving--their 
						country and others.&quot;<br>
						<br>
						Vinson Sailors said they were proud of their 
						efforts in support of the numerous humanitarian aid 
						and disaster relief missions in which they were 
						involved.<br>
						<br>
						&quot;I had a chance to talk to some of the Haitians,&quot; 
						said Machinist's Mate Fireman Evangelina Abarca. 
						&quot;It hurt a lot to know that many of them had lost 
						family members, but I've never been more proud to 
						say that I am a member of the United States Navy.&quot;<br>
						<br>
						USS Carl Vinson will now continue on its original 
						mission, performing Theater Security Cooperation (TSC) 
						engagements with key Latin American partners while 
						transiting to its homeport of San 
						Diego.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;</span><p class="MsoNormal">JACKSONVILLE, Fla. --
					<span style="font-size: 14.0pt">A major review of the 
					United States military forces released late Friday by 
					the Department of Defense said the U.S. Navy will 
					homeport a nuclear aircraft carrier in Mayport.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					The DoD said the decision will protect the fleet 
					against a potential terror attack, accident or natural 
					disaster, since currently all East Coast aircraft 
					carriers are based at Norfolk Naval Station.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					The Quadrennial Defense Review Report will be submitted 
					to Congress on Monday and additional funding will have 
					to be approved, but preliminary work on the Mayport 
					basin was funded late last year and is under way.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					Mayport has been without a carrier since the USS John 
					F. Kennedy was decommissioned in 2007. Since then, 
					there's been a push by Jacksonville and Florida 
					lawmakers to bring a state-of-the-art nuclear carrier 
					to Mayport. But the move was opposed at ever step of 
					the way by elected officials in Virginia.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					“While I believe the Navy was right on the money when 
					they made the decision to homeport a nuclear aircraft 
					carrier at Mayport last January, I am glad to see that 
					national security, not politics, stands victorious in 
					the latest Pentagon’s review,” said Rep. Ander 
					Crenshaw, R-Jacksonville.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla, said the decision is big 
					for the north Florida economy.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					&quot;This is something Ander and (Rep.) Corrine Brown and I 
					have been fighting for for almost 10 years,&quot; said 
					Nelson, a member of the Senate Armed Services 
					Committee. &quot;This will cement Jacksonville's and 
					Mayport's place in our nation's defense.&quot;</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					It's not clear if Mayport would get an older carrier or 
					the newly commissioned USS George H. W. Bush, which is 
					currently homeported in Norfolk, Va.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					Sen. George LeMieux, R-Fla., said the announcement 
					marks a historic day for the Jacksonville Naval 
					Station.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">&quot;A 
					nuclear carrier homeported here is the right decision 
					for the right reasons,&quot; LeMieux said. &quot;In addition to 
					strengthening the fabric of our national security, this 
					will mean thousands of jobs and families for this 
					region.&quot;</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					LeMieux said members of the Navy and local officials 
					were elated by the announcement.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					LeMieux said the next step is to look at what will be 
					necessary for Mayport to serve in its new role.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					&quot;What President (Barack) Obama includes in his fiscal 
					year 2011 budget due out next week will give us a 
					clearer picture of that schedule,&quot; LeMieux said.</span></p>

					<h3>Indian Navy To Induct MiG-29K Fighter Jets</h3>
					<p class="story-byline">(ECONOMIC TIMES (INDIA) 31 JAN 
					10)</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					NEW DELHI -- The Indian Navy will induct on Feb 19 the 
					first four Russian-made MiG-29K combat jets for 
					deployment on the aircraft carrier Admiral Gorshkov.
					</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					&quot;The aircraft will be formally inducted Feb 19,&quot; a 
					senior Indian Navy official told. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					The fighters are operating offshore Goa in the absence 
					of aircraft carrier Gorshkov, which is to be 
					commissioned as INS Vikramaditya. The combat jets had 
					arrived in the country in knocked down condition last 
					year Dec 4. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					&quot;The jets have been assembled and the Russian pilots 
					are flying them. It is a standard procedure. Very soon 
					Indian Navy pilots will take over from them,&quot; the 
					official added. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					The jets were purchased by the Indian Navy as part of a 
					$1.5 billion deal signed with Russia in January 2004 
					for Admiral Gorshkov. Of this, $740 million was meant 
					for the aircraft and the balance for refitting the 
					carrier. The Russians have now upped the price to 
					between $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion and negotiations 
					are currently under way. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					The navy will eventually be getting 12 MiG-29K single-seater 
					aircraft and four MiG-29KUB twin-seat trainer aircraft, 
					some in flyaway condition. The trainer version is 
					similar to the single-seater but with a slightly 
					reduced operational range. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					The navy has named its MiG-29K squadron the &quot;Black 
					Panthers&quot;. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					The jets will undertake shore-based sorties from Goa as 
					the 45,000-tonne Kiev class aircraft carrier is 
					scheduled to be delivered by 2012. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					The contract for the jets also stipulates the 
					procurement of hardware for pilot training and aircraft 
					maintenance, including flight simulators and 
					interactive ground and sea-based training systems.
					</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					Indian Navy pilots were sent to the US for deck landing 
					training and qualified flying instructors (QFIs) to 
					Russia for conversion flying (converting to different 
					aircraft). </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					The pilots will do the conversion flying in Goa under 
					the supervision of QFIs. Four to five batches 
					comprising four pilots each had gone to the US for deck 
					landing training. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					The navy's MiG-29Ks have arrester gear and stronger 
					landing gear for carrier landings, folding wings and 
					rust-proofing to prevent corrosion from salt water.
					</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					The aircraft features a fully digitised glass cockpit, 
					improved engine protection against ingestion of foreign 
					particles like birds, a multi-mode radar and increased 
					range. The contract ensures that the navy gets the 
					entire spectrum of services, including a full mission 
					simulator. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					The MiG-29K will provide aerial cover to the carrier's 
					battle group, acquire air superiority and destroy 
					sea-borne and ground-based targets with guided 
					high-precision weapons during the day and at night and 
					in any weather condition. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					The aircraft, the first bought by the navy after the 
					Sea Harriers, will also be capable of playing the role 
					of midair refueller. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">In 
					a bid to revamp its aviation capability, the Indian 
					Navy will also be inking a contract to buy 29 more 
					MiG-29Ks worth nearly $1.2 billion from Russia. A 
					Russian team arrived here in January to finetune the 
					contract terms.&nbsp; </span></p>

					<h3>Lockheed Strengthening Fuselage In Navy’s F-35 
					Model </h3>
					<p class="story-byline">(BLOOMBERG NEWS 29 JAN 10) ...
					<span style="font-style: normal">Tony Capaccio</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					Lockheed Martin Corp. is fixing a structural weakness 
					in the Navy version of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter 
					that limits the jet’s ability to launch from aircraft 
					carriers, according to a company spokesman. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					Engineers in July discovered a “strength shortfall” in 
					an aluminum structure in the aircraft’s center fuselage 
					that helps absorb stresses during a catapult takeoff, 
					Lockheed spokesman John Kent said today in an e-mailed 
					statement. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					“U.S. Navy and program office engineers were apprised 
					immediately and have been directly involved in 
					approving design updates,” Kent said. “A modification 
					is already approved and ready to incorporate early this 
					year prior to any catapult testing planned for 2011.”
					</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					The modification doesn’t affect the aircraft’s progress 
					toward first flight and is expected to have “little or 
					no impact” on the plane’s shipboard testing, he said.
					</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					“There was never a problem with landing -- only 
					catapult launch,” Kent said. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed plans to build the 
					fighters in three variants for the U.S. Air Force, Navy 
					and Marine Corps. The current estimated cost is $298 
					billion. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					The carrier version is the last of the three variants 
					to go into operation and is scheduled to be used on 
					carriers operating with Boeing F/A-18E/F fighters by 
					2015. The first development model is scheduled for its 
					maiden flight by August 30, Kent said. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					Ashton Carter, the Pentagon’s chief weapons buyer, and 
					Michael Gilmore, director of operational test and 
					evaluation, declined to comment through Pentagon 
					spokeswoman Cheryl Irwin. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><b>
					<span style="font-size: 14.0pt">Pentagon Report </span>
					</b></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					The issue wasn’t disclosed in Gilmore’s annual’s report 
					released last week. That report said F-35 testing so 
					far raised concerns that engine blasts from the carrier 
					model and Marine Corps short-takeoff and 
					vertical-landing versions could cause deck damage and 
					injure personnel. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					The F-35 is the Pentagon’s largest weapons program. The 
					fiscal 2011 defense budget set for release Feb. 1 
					requests 42 fighters, up from 30 this year. As many as 
					20 jets are Navy and Marine Corp versions. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					Kent said all design changes to strengthen the center 
					fuselage will be incorporated before parts are made for 
					the first production F-35Cs in the fourth initial 
					production contract now under negotiation for 30 
					aircraft. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					This is only a development-phase issue “and a minor one 
					at that,” Kent said. “This is part of our normal 
					airframe development process, and is not a concern for 
					the Navy.” </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					Cheryl Limrick, a spokesman for F-35 military program 
					manager Marine Corp. Major General David Heinz, didn’t 
					return an e-mail seeking comment today. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					The Navy plans to buy as many as 680 carrier and 
					short-take- off versions of 2,456 planned jets. </span>
					</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><b>
					<span style="font-size: 14.0pt">Deck Damage </span></b>
					</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					The Pentagon’s Gilmore said in his report that the 
					engine and power-systems’ exhaust on the Navy and 
					Marine versions is powerful enough to pose a threat to 
					carrier personnel. The blasts also may damage shields 
					used to deflect heat on the deck, including on the 
					CVN-21 carrier, the Navy’s most expensive warship.
					</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					“Early analyses of findings indicate that integration 
					of the F-35 into the CVN-21 will result in damage to 
					the carrier deck environment and will adversely affect 
					hangar deck operations,” Gilmore wrote. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					The Navy model’s exhaust area is larger than the Boeing 
					planes’, making the jet-blast deflectors used during 
					launch “vulnerable to warping and failure,” he wrote.
					</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					Exhaust from the Marine Corp version’s integrated power 
					system deflect downward and may be “a hazard to flight 
					deck refueling, munitions, personnel and equipment” 
					located on catwalks, the report said. </span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 14.0pt">
					Lockheed spokesman Chris Giesel said tests conducted 
					with the JSF Program Office and the Navy “are showing 
					positive results regarding compatibility of the F-35’s 
					exhaust with carrier decks and tarmac surfaces. The 
					study will conclude in spring 2010.” </span></p>

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">The Navy's plan was

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">While the Navy's new

					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;[There is a] chance

					develop the ships.&quot;</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">The Navy plans to 
					build eight DDG-51s over the FYDP, beginning with two

					<h3>Proposed Defense Budget Paves Way For Carrier Base

					10) ... Hugh Lessig</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">As Florida lawmakers 
					celebrated, Virginia leaders on Monday girded for 
					another attempt keep an aircraft carrier and its 
					thousands of jobs from leaving Hampton Roads.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">The Defense 
					Department is moving closer to building a permanent 
					aircraft carrier base in Florida, a move it justifies 
					on strategic grounds but one that endangers thousands 
					of jobs in southeastern Virginia.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">The Quadrennial 
					Defense Review, formally released Monday, suggests that 
					the Navy plans to move a carrier out of Virginia to 
					fulfill its plan.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;To mitigate the 
					risk of terrorist attack, accident or natural disaster, 
					the U.S. Navy will home-port an East Coast carrier in 
					Mayport, Fla,&quot; states the QDR.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">All East Coast 
					carriers are based at Naval Station Norfolk. If a 
					carrier strike group were to leave Hampton Roads, the 
					job loss would be akin to a major factory shutdown.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">Virginia lawmakers 
					have vowed to fight the move.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;This is not a done 
					deal,&quot; said Sen. Jim Webb, a member of the Senate Armed 
					Services Committee.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">Webb and others have 
					pointed to the cost of upgrading Mayport, which has 
					accommodated older carriers but not one from the 
					nuclear-powered fleet. Dredging and other improvements 
					could cost up to $1 billion, according to some 
					estimates.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">They say the 
					strategic value of dispersing the fleet is overstated 
					and the Navy has more pressing fiscal needs.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">Webb said he looks 
					forward to questioning Defense Secretary Robert Gates 
					and Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
					Staff, during today's meeting of the armed services 
					panel.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;I would be curious 
					to see where the Navy believes that it can take a 
					billion dollars away from shipbuilding, weapons 
					procurement, ship maintenance and repair, and building 
					a fleet in order to construct an alternate port which, 
					on all accounts, doesn't seem to be needed,&quot; Webb said.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">Sen. Mark R. Warner 
					added, &quot;In a time of concern about federal spending and 
					budget deficits, I will be asking tough questions about 
					this Pentagon plan to divert $700 million to $1 billion 
					— or more — to reassign an aircraft carrier from the 
					Norfolk naval station.&quot;</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;It would be 
					fiscally irresponsible to spend any money on a 
					redundant East Coast homeport,&quot; said Rep. Glenn Nye, 
					D-Norfolk. &quot;The Navy has never demonstrated a 
					risk-based, strategic need to relocate a nuclear 
					aircraft carrier out of Norfolk, and with the national 
					debt skyrocketing, the American people simply cannot 
					afford redundant, unnecessary projects like this.&quot;</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">Rep. Randy Forbes, 
					R- Chesapeake, questioned the spending on Mayport in 
					light of a $1.3 billion shortfall in public shipyard 
					infrastructure and the growing size of China's Navy.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;I intend to demand 
					full transparency into the decision-making behind the 
					proposed use of up to a billion of taxpayer dollars on 
					a move regarded as duplicative and even 'scandalous,'&quot; 
					he said in a statement.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">However, the 
					language in the QDR is a clearly setback to Virginia's 
					argument.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;It's definitely 
					more significant than if it was just a budgetary 
					statement, because the QDR is supposed to be the basic 
					strategy document for a number of years,&quot; said Bill 
					Hartung, director of the Arms and Security Initiative 
					at the New America Foundation.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">Florida lawmakers 
					have already hailed the carrier move as a done deal and 
					a coming boon to the Jacksonville-area economy.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;The reason for 
					moving one of the nuclear carriers from Norfolk to 
					Mayport is so they're not all lined up in one place 
					like sitting ducks,&quot; said Sen. Bill Nelson, R-Fla.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">Job loss will hurt</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">The reaction began 
					Friday when CongressDaily, a political newsletter, 
					posted the final draft of the Quadrennial Defense 
					Review on its Web site.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">&quot;This is an historic 
					day for Mayport,&quot; said Sen. George LeMieux, R-Fla. last 
					week. &quot;A nuclear carrier home-ported here is the right 
					decision for the right reasons. In addition to 
					strengthening the fabric of our national security, this 
					will mean thousands of jobs and families for this 
					region.&quot;</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">If a carrier strike 
					group were to leave Hampton Roads, it would hit the 
					area much harder than the 2007 shutdown of Ford Motor 
					Co.'s truck factory in Norfolk, which employed 2,400 
					people.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">That's according to 
					the 2009 State of the Region report from Old Dominion 
					University. It said the gross regional product of 
					Hampton Roads drops by 1 percent each month a carrier 
					task force is away from Hampton Roads. That translates 
					into a $900 million loss over one year.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-family: Verdana">Another opportunity

					<span style="font-size: 14.0pt">The Ministry of Defense 
					won’t be able to afford as much as half of the 
					equipment it plans to buy in the next decade, according 
					to a report into procurement last year by Bernard Gray, 
					a former government adviser on defense. With no party 
					guaranteeing defense spending, major projects may fall 
					victim to efforts to cut the country’s budget deficit.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-size: 14.0pt">Companies working with 
					BAE on the carriers include Thales SA, Electronic Data 
					Systems LLC, Lockheed Martin Corp., Qinetiq Group Plc, 
					Rolls-Royce Group Plc and VT Group Plc.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-size: 14.0pt">The two carriers will 
					cost about 1 billion pounds ($1.6 billion) more than 
					the planned 3.9 billion pounds because of delays and 
					changes in design, the ministry said in June.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-size: 14.0pt">Shares of BAE fell 8.3 
					pence, or 2.4 percent, to 338.8 pence at 3:25 p.m. in 
					London.</span></p>

					<span style="font-size: 14.0pt">Trident Plans</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-size: 14.0pt">Ainsworth refused to 
					guarantee other projects, such as the Joint Strike 
					Fighter currently planned to fly off the carriers. He 
					did say there’s “no plan to revisit” the 2006 decision 
					to renew Britain’s Trident nuclear-weapons system.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-size: 14.0pt">Air Chief Marshall Jock 
					Stirrup, the chief of the defense staff, confirmed that 
					one option in the review is the abolition of one of the 
					three arms of U.K. forces, the Army, the Royal Navy and 
					the Royal Air Force. “It’s plausible,” he said, when 
					asked if the U.K. might only have two services in a 
					decade, without giving more detail. That may mean the 
					integration of the RAF into the Army and Navy.</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-left: .25in">
					<span style="font-size: 14.0pt">The ministry later said 
					in an e-mailed statement that Stirrup had been saying 
					the idea of the three services remaining separate was 
					plausible, not the idea of abolishing one.</span></p>
