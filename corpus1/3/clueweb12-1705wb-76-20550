  Formulas to Analyze Tax Planning Strategies</b></font>
<div align="left"> 
  <P><i>By<b> John O. Everett, Roxanne Spindle, and Thomas Turman</b></i></P>
  <P>The combination of declining regular tax rates and the variety of capital 
    gains rates has created a degree of uncertainty in planning for capital gains 
    income. Nevertheless, significant tax saving opportunity can be identified 
    by using simple breakeven analysis tools. Five different tax planning issues 
    are described below, along with the appropriate breakeven formulas and examples 
    that illustrate their use. 
  <P>Each formula is derived by developing algebraic expressions for alternative 
    tax options and then setting the two expressions equal to one another. Present-value 
    analysis is incorporated in those cases that involve more than one tax year. 
    The resulting formula is then solved for the necessary breakeven amount between 
    the two options.
  <P><b>Long-Term Capital Gains Treatment</b>
  <P>If the stock market should recover quickly, investors might realize significant 
    stock gains in relatively short periods of time. This may induce taxpayers 
    to sell in the short run to avoid potential price declines in the near future. 
    Given the recent significant reductions in tax rates for long-term capital 
    gains, some investors may be tempted to defer the sale until the stock has 
    been held longer than one year. Thus, the question for investors sometimes 
    becomes whether they should realize a certain gain today as short-term capital 
    gain and pay the additional tax at ordinary income tax rates, or hold the 
    stock until they have met the long-term holding period and pay the lower capital 
    gains tax rates. What sales price would equate the two options on an after-tax 
    basis?
  <P>Breakeven analysis can be used to determine how much loss in stock value 
    a taxpayer can afford in chasing a lower tax rate. The breakeven formula developed 
    below reflects the following equality:
  <P><i>After-tax proceeds from selling after achieving long-term status = After-tax 
    proceeds from selling at the present time</i>
  <P>The breakeven formula may be expressed as follows:
  <P>BSP - [(BSP - AB) x CGR] = CSP - [(CSP - AB) x OTR] 
  <P>Where BSP is the breakeven sales price of the stock (a sales price exceeding 
    this amount favors waiting for long-term status), AB is the adjusted basis 
    of the stock, CGR is the capital gains tax rate, CSP is the current sales 
    price of stock, and OTR is the ordinary income marginal tax rate.
  <P><i><b>Example 1.</b></i> Tina, who is in the 38.6% marginal tax bracket, 
    holds a stock with an adjusted basis of $80,000 that she bought eight months 
    ago and would sell today for $140,000. How much decline in value can Tina 
    afford to absorb while waiting to qualify for the 20% long-term rate? The 
    answer may be determined by using the formula: 
  <P>BSP - [(BSP - AB) x CGR] = CSP - [(CSP - AB) x OTR]<br>
    BSP - [(BSP - $80,000) x .20] = $140,000 - [($140,000 - $80,000) x .386]<br>
    BSP - .20 BSP + $16,000 = $140,000 - $54,040 + $30,880<br>
    .80 BSP = $100,840<br>
    BSP = $126,050
  <P>Thus, the stock could decline in value as much as $13,950 ($140,000 - $126,050) 
    and Tina would realize the same after-tax proceeds from the sale. Note that 
    the preceding calculation does not consider potential time value of money 
    issues, since the time differential between the two options is only four months. 
    If the stock did not achieve long-term status until the following tax year, 
    then the left side of the equation would be discounted one year on a present-value 
    basis to reflect this. (For even more precision, the discounting could be 
    done on a quarterly basis.)
  <P><b>Election for Investment Interest Expense</b>
  <P>In general, IRC section 163 limits the annual deduction for investment interest 
    expense to the taxpayer&#8217;s net investment income for the year. (Any excess 
    may be carried forward indefinitely to future years.) For these purposes, 
    net investment income does not include any long-term capital gains on sales 
    or exchanges of investment properties. IRC section 163(d)(4)(B)(iii), however, 
    permits a special election whereby the taxpayer may treat a net long-term 
    capital gain as investment income during the year if the taxpayer agrees to 
    treat such elected gain as ordinary income taxed at the normal rates. The 
    decision to make this election hinges on when the taxpayer believes that any 
    investment interest otherwise disallowed in the current year will be deducted 
    if the special election is not made. 
  <P>Any analysis of the two options must consider the time value of money, because 
    postponed interest expense would be deducted in future years. In this case, 
    the breakeven number represents the rate of return generated by the tax savings 
    from the election in the current year (created by offsetting income that would 
    otherwise have been taxed at 20%) that would equal the tax savings from using 
    the expense to offset ordinary income in the future. This can be expressed 
    as follows:
  <P><i>Tax savings in current year with special capital gains election (20% of 
    capital gain) = Present value of tax savings with deduction in Year 2 only 
    (38.6% of ordinary income)</i>
  <P>The number of present value factors incorporated in the formula depends upon 
    the number of years the taxpayer believes will be necessary to fully recover 
    the carryover interest deductions. If the taxpayer believes that postponed 
    deductions will be utilized in the next taxable year, the comparison would 
    appear as follows:
  <P>DED x CGR = DED x OTR x R 
  <P>Where DED is the investment interest expense deduction, OTR is the ordinary 
    income marginal tax rate, CGR is the capital gains marginal tax rate, and 
    R = (1+ r)n, where r is the breakeven interest rate and n is the number of 
    years in the future.
  <P><i><b>Example 2. </b></i>Jim, a taxpayer in the 38.6% bracket, has $100,000 
    of net investment interest expenses and $80,000 of net investment incomes 
    in 2003. Jim also has a $20,000 long-term capital gain on the sale of investments 
    that qualifies for the 20% rate. Jim believes that any interest expense disallowed 
    during the current year will be deducted in the next tax year (2004). Thus, 
    Jim&#8217;s two tax choices are to save 20% tax on capital gain otherwise 
    taxed in Year 1, or save 38.6% on ordinary income in Year 2.
  <P>The comparison would be calculated as follows:
  <P>DED x CRR = DED x OTR x R<br>
    20,000 x .20 = (20,000 x .386) / (1 + R) <br>
    4,000 = 7,720 / (1 + R)<br>
    4,000 (1 + R) = 7,720<br>
    4,000R = 3,720<br>
    R = .93
  <P>Thus, the additional tax savings generated by the election in Year 1 must 
    be invested at an annual rate of return of 93% (an unlikely possibility) to 
    equal the tax savings available by waiting one year. Clearly, the election 
    does not make much sense in this example, because merely deferring the deduction 
    one year yields $3,720 in tax savings.
  <P>Changes in the underlying assumptions can change this clearcut analysis. 
    For example, if the taxpayer&#8217;s ordinary income tax rate is only 27%, 
    the breakeven opportunity cost interest rate would be 25%, still unrealistic 
    but much lower than the previous example. Additionally, the above analysis 
    makes the assumption that any nondeductible investment interest in Year 1 
    can be deducted in Year 2. But if the taxpayer expects that it will be three 
    years before the interest expense carryover can be deducted, the right side 
    of the above equations could be modified to solve for a present value factor 
    that could be used to determine the required interest rate. In such cases, 
    the breakeven interest rate would decrease, since a longer period is required 
    to fully recoup the deductions. For instance, a taxpayer who expects to defer 
    the deduction until Year 3 when a 25% marginal tax rate applies would have 
    to invest the tax savings at only about 8% to break even. 
  <P><b>Sale vs. Abandonment of Business Assets </b>
  <P>In some cases, it may make economic sense to abandon a business asset rather 
    than sell it at a loss. If the loss on the sale and the abandonment loss would 
    both be deductible against income taxed at the same rate, then the sale option 
    is always preferable, since some cash is received. If, however, the decision 
    must be made in a year in which the taxpayer has already recognized IRC section 
    1231 gains, any loss on the sale of the additional asset might offset gain 
    that would be taxed at the lower capital gains rate. The abandonment might 
    then result in greater after-tax savings, because the abandonment is not considered 
    a sale or exchange [Treasury Regulations section 1.165-2(b)], and any recognized 
    loss bypasses the IRC section 1231 netting process and is reported as an ordinary 
    loss. (This situation would occur only if the taxpayer has a net section 1231 
    gain that is not recharacterized as ordinary income through the special five-year 
    look-back rule.)
  <P>Breakeven analysis can be used under these circumstances to determine the 
    price at which it becomes more profitable to sell the asset than abandon it. 
    This can be expressed as follows:
  <P><i>Savings generated by a sale at a loss (tax savings at ordinary rates) 
    = Savings generated by an abandonment (selling price + tax savings at capital 
    gain rates)</i>
  <P>The relevant equation is as follows:
  <P>BSP + [(AB &#8211; BSP) x CGR] = AB x OTR 
  <P>Where BSP is the breakeven sales price (sales prices exceeding this amount 
    favor sales), AB is the adjusted basis of the business asset, CGR is the capital 
    gains tax rate, and OTR is the ordinary income marginal tax rate.
  <P><i><b>Example 3. </b></i>Talbot has a greatly depreciated business asset 
    with an adjusted basis of $100,000. Talbot has already recognized a net IRC 
    section 1231 gain in the current year of $130,000 that qualifies for the 20% 
    capital gains rate. Talbot&#8217;s marginal ordinary income tax rate is 38.6%. 
    The equation determines the scrap value at which it will be more beneficial 
    to sell the asset than abandon it.
  <P>BSP + [(AB - BSP) x CGR] = [AB x OTR]<br>
    BSP + [(100,000 - BSP) x .20] = [100,000 x .386]<br>
    BSP + 20,000 - .20BSP = 38,600<br>
    .80BSP = 18,600<br>
    BSP = $23,250
  <P>Thus, Talbot should sell the asset if he can receive at least $23,250 for 
    it. If the sales price is less than $23,250, the tax savings from the abandonment 
    will exceed the sum of the cash received plus the tax savings generated by 
    the sale at a loss.
  <P><b>Investment or Inventory in Subdivided Realty</b>
  <P>A longstanding controversy between taxpayers and the IRS is the tax treatment 
    of sales of subdivided realty at a gain. Taxpayers generally contend that 
    such properties are investment properties qualifying for capital gains treatment, 
    while the IRS generally contends that the taxpayer in fact has the characteristics 
    of a real estate dealer, and such gains should be treated as ordinary income 
    sales of inventory. Generally, the courts examine a number of factors when 
    classifying such sales, and they often note that each case is unique and must 
    be decided on the basis of its particular facts. A classic and often-cited 
    case that describes the appropriate factors to consider is <i>Winthrop v. 
    Comm&#8217;r</i> [417 F.2d. 905 (CA-5, 1969)].
  <P>IRC section 1237 was enacted to make it easier for noncorporate taxpayers 
    holding realty as an investment to do limited subdividing and yet still receive 
    capital gains treatment. IRC section 1237 offers three different classifications 
    for such taxpayers: (1) &#8220;investors,&#8221; for whom capital gains treatment 
    is available for the first five lot sales (contiguous lots sold to the same 
    purchaser count as one lot sale); (2) &#8220;brokers&#8221; for whom, in the 
    year of the sixth lot sale and all future years, 5% of the sales price (less 
    applicable selling expenses) is treated as ordinary income, and the balance 
    of the gain is capital gain; and (3) &#8220;dealers,&#8221; for whom, if significant 
    improvements are made to the lots, all gain must be reported as ordinary income. 
    For these purposes, Treasury Regulations section 1.1237-1(c)(3) defines a 
    &#8220;significant improvement&#8221; as one that increases the value of the 
    lot more than 10%.
  <P>Taxpayers not meeting the safe harbor of IRC section 1237 may nonetheless 
    contest the IRS position that they are in fact dealers by stressing the factors 
    indicating an investment motive. A wealth of judicial decisions on both sides 
    of the issue is available for these purposes.
  <P>Despite the lower marginal tax rates on ordinary income, the distinction 
    between ordinary and capital gains treatment on subdivided realty can still 
    be a significant tax issue. Sometimes taxpayers may decide that significant 
    improvements will lead to a significant increase in the sales price of the 
    subdivided lots that will compensate for forgoing capital gains treatment. 
    Once again, this decision can be portrayed by means of a breakeven formula:
  <P><i>After-tax proceeds &#8211; dealer status (ordinary income for realized 
    gains) = After-tax proceeds &#8211; investor status (capital gains for realized 
    gains)</i>
  <P>The breakeven formula is expressed as follows:
  <P>BSP - IMP - [(BSP - IMP - AB) x OTR] = CSP - [(CSP - AB) x CGR] 
  <P>Where BSP is the breakeven sales price to equate dealer and investor options, 
    IMP is the cost of the improvements to the realty, AB is the current adjusted 
    basis of the property (without the improvements), OTR is the ordinary income 
    marginal tax rate, CSP is the current sales price without the improvements, 
    and CGR is the capital gains tax rate. 
  <P><i><b>Example 4. </b></i>Tracey purchased 10 acres of land 10 years ago for 
    $40,000. Her real estate adviser has estimated that she could sell the 10 
    acres for a total of $100,000 by dividing the land into five two-acre plots. 
    The potential selling price would increase substantially if she made $20,000 
    worth of improvements to the property (clearing, grading, and adding water 
    and sewage). Tracey&#8217;s marginal ordinary income tax rate is 38.6%, and 
    her marginal capital gains rate is 20%. The estimated sales price that she 
    would have to receive to justify incurring the additional cost of the improvements 
    and the additional taxes associated with ordinary income tax rates can be 
    determined with the following equation: 
  <P>BSP - IMP - [(BSP - IMP - AB) x OTR] = CSP - [(CSP - AB) x CGR]<br>
    BSP - 20,000 - [(BSP - 20,000 - 40,000) x .386] = 100,000 - [(100,000 - 40,000) 
    x .20]<br>
    BSP - 20,000 - .386BSP + 23,160 = 100,000 - 12,000<br>
    .614BSP = 84,840<br>
    BSP = $138,176
  <P>Thus, Tracey would have to realize an additional $138,176 in the sale to 
    cover the $20,000 cost of the improvements and the additional taxes caused 
    by ordinary income treatment. If her ordinary income tax rate was less than 
    38.6%, the required breakeven sales price would decrease.
  <P><b>&#8220;Deemed Sale&#8221; Election 2001 Returns and Later</b>
  <P>For properties acquired after 2000, the maximum capital gains rate for properties 
    held more than five years is reduced from 20% to 18%, as prescribed in IRC 
    section 1(h). Taxpayers holding capital assets on January 1, 2001, however, 
    could elect to mark to market the asset on that date (i.e., treat the asset 
    as having been sold for its fair market value and then immediately reacquired 
    on that date for the same value). Any resulting gain (but not loss) is reportable 
    as a taxable gain on the 2001 tax return, and the asset will then qualify 
    for the new 18% rate, if held more than the required five years.
  <P>Given that this election must be made on the 2001 return, the window for 
    considering this election has closed. However, it is instructive to see how 
    breakeven <br>
    analysis could have been applied to this election. Such &#8220;opportunities&#8221; 
    to accelerate tax liability (and accelerate total tax collections) will undoubtedly 
    be considered by Congress again.
  <P>In essence, a taxpayer making this election would pay a 20% tax rate now 
    on unrealized appreciation on a capital asset for the privilege of paying 
    an 18% tax rate five years from now on any additional appreciation on the 
    same asset. In making this decision, it would have been helpful for the taxpayer 
    to know how much the property would have to appreciate in five years (generating 
    tax savings on the 2% capital gains rate differential) to justify the current 
    payment of tax at a 20% rate.
  <P>The breakeven formula can be stated as follows: 
  <P><i>Present value of total taxes paid with a deemed election in the current 
    year = Present value of total taxes paid without a deemed election</i>
  <P>The breakeven equation is as follows:
  <P>[(BSP - AB) x .20] - {[(BSP - SP) x.18] x PV} = {[(BSP - AB) x .20] x PV} 
  <P>Where BSP is the necessary breakeven sales price of the stock, PV is the 
    present value factor of cost of capital for five years, SP is the current 
    selling price of the stock, and AB is the adjusted basis of the stock.
  <P>The left side of the equation is the cost of paying a 20% tax on the current 
    appreciation (SP - AB) now and an 18% tax on the future appreciation (BSP 
    - SP) in Year 5. 
  <P>The right side of the equation is the cost of paying all of the tax in Year 
    5 at the 20% rate.
  <P><i><b>Example 5.</b></i> Sam owns stock with an adjusted basis of $40,000 
    and a current value of $100,000. A gain on the sale of such stock would qualify 
    for the 20% rate. Using the discount factor of 5% for amounts received in 
    Year 5 (.783526), what is the breakeven sales price of the stock necessary 
    to justify making the deemed sale election?
  <P>The cost of paying a 20% tax on the current appreciation (SP -AB) and an 
    18% tax on the future appreciation (BSP - SP) in Year 5 is 
  <P>[($100,000 - $40,000) x .20] + {[(BSP - $100,000) x .18] x .783526<br>
    141035BSP - $2,103. 
  <P>The cost of paying all of the tax in Year 5 at the 20% rate is 
  <P>{[(BSP - $40,000) x .20] x .783526} <br>
    .1567052BSP - $6,268.
  <P>Setting the two equations equal and solving yields the following:
  <P>.141035BSP - $2,103 = .1567052BSP - $6,268 <br>
    .0156702BSP = $4,165<br>
    BSP = $265,791
  <P>The price of the stock would have to almost triple to justify the deemed 
    sale election, which accelerates the payment of some tax for five years. If 
    the adjusted basis of the stock were $80,000, the computed breakeven sales 
    price would fall to $155,298.
