The Civil War Preservation Trust recently placed the Atlanta site on the top of
its list of America's most endangered battlefields, together with more famous
sites like Gettysburg, Harpers Ferry, WV, and Stones River, TN.<br>
<br>
Hundreds of yards of trenches and fortifications, nearly intact since they were
built during the siege of Atlanta in 1864 were recently discovered. The
discovery of the area, nestled along the Utoy Creek in one of the largest areas
of green space left in Atlanta, was a shock. Atlanta's battlefields had been
written off in the 1960's, by which time development had paved nearly all of
them over, leaving nothing but memorial plaques on the edges of bustling
highways. &quot;We all assumed there was nothing left,&quot; says local activist
Bob Price. &quot;The relic hunters knew it was there, but nobody else gave it a
second thought.&quot; Extract from article, A More Civil War by Andrew Curry,
U.S. News &amp; World Report, pg. 58, 3-11, 2002<br>
<br>
(((((Chuck))))))) Thanks.... Too many of the battlefields are being lost. It's
good to see someone is finally taking action.<br>

</b>
(these items are extracts from our Letters, Songs, and Poems evenings)<br>
<br>
Good evening everyone, my name is Don Gallagher and I'm speaking and answering
questions on &quot;<i>Reading the Civil War</i>&quot;. I am president of the
28th Pennsylvania Historical Association, a Lt. in Co. C, 28th Pennsylvania
Volunteer Infantry (Civil War re-enactors) and an avid reader and collector of
books on the American Civil War. My personal library is a little over 1500
volumes and nowhere near complete (although my wife has a decidedly different
opinion). With close to 80,000 books and articles published, reading the Civil
War is a study itself. I'll try to cover where to start for beginners and give
some tips and opinions for more advanced readers.<br>
<br>
Books on the Civil War are generally divided into primary and secondary sources.
Primary being written by those who participated, witnessed or had some hand in
the subject. Secondary being everything else. We'll start with the beginner or
relative newcomer who isn't too concerned with sources yet. Anyone who wants to
begin to understand the war, should read an overview, to put the events and
timeline into perspective. James McPherson's work &quot;<i>The Battle Cry of
Freedom</i>&quot; is probably the best single volume work. Allen Nevins' 8
volume set &quot;<i>The Crisis of the Union</i>&quot; covering the years 1846 to
1865, with 4 volumes dedicated to the war years, is the most thorough and
complete history of the war. Nevins' covers the pre-war (or antebellum)
political scene and social history well enough, within the context of an
overview, to give a solid foundation for understanding the coming of the war. In
between we have, in my opinion the best, Bruce Catton's &quot;<i>The Centennial
History of the Civil War</i>.&quot; Catton's trilogy while not the biggest or
most detailed is unequaled for eloquence and readability.<br>
<br>
Now you have before you the table with the literary feast of Civil War history.
The question is how to fill my plate and digest my choices? No one can read
everything. It would be difficult to read just a little on each of the many
battles, campaigns, personalities and politics involved. Most people who are
interested, have some idea of where they would like to start. An ancestor's
regiment, a battle or campaign, the causes of the war, Abraham Lincoln or Robert
E. Lee. Whatever motivates your interest should be your direction. Then see
where it takes you. It's a journey, with a lot of forks in the road. The next
big question is with so many choices, which books to read, how do I separate the
wheat from the chaff? Most of the current Civil War periodicals have a section
with book reviews. One quarterly, &quot;<i>The Civil War Book Review</i>&quot;
deals only in that subject. Additionally there are dozens of bibliographies.
Some extensive like &quot;<i>Civil War Books: A Critical Bibliography</i>,&quot;
most limited by subject. The best and most commonly used sources are the books
themselves. Any author/historian worth his salt, will have in their book a
bibliography or bibliographic essay listing the sources of their research. Any
modern author who doesn't back up their writing/research with a listing of their
sources, risks not being taken seriously. Therefore a good authors book should
contain a cornucopia of suggested reading. Also it can be assumed that a good
author will have screened his sources and only use those that are pertinent and
of good quality.<br>
<br>
I have found some of the best reading to be the many diaries and letter
collections that have been and continue to be published. These are the plain
unedited words written while they were on the scene. They paint a picture in
your mind's eye like no other. These compilations run from the semiliterate to
the college educated, from private soldier to general officer with all their
different perspectives. Their writing also ranges from mundane to excellent. I
could continue on here, the subject &quot;<i>Reading the Civil War</i>&quot; is
book length in itself, but we have to cut it off somewhere. I'm ready and
anxious to hear your questions and opinions. Just bear with me, I'm not a great
typist.</font>

them the Fireside as well as other goodies- Armistead, Border Wars, Cushing and

{{Ted}} You've made my day with that statement. Oddly enough that is not a
rareity with those on distribution. I would hazard a guess that our actual
distribution is 30 - 40% more than actual due to that very &quot;passing
on&quot;. We'll certainly take a peek. Especially in Missouri, I know for a fact
that reenactments occur yearly at Lexington, MO (Battle of Lexington) and
Springfield MO (Battle of Wilson's Creek) as well as Bentonville Ark (just south
of Joplin) (Battle of Pea Ridge or Elkhorn Tavern) occur yearly.</font>

<br>
Could somebody please give me a couple of ideas about someplace to donate the
above mentioned book? I just returned from a trip to California and while there
I bought this book at a flea market. It contains the entire history of the unit,
including the names of all personnel in all companies, where they were enlisted
from, all the battles they fought in, who was wounded or killed, just about
everything someone who had a ancestor in the unit would want to know. There are
also some pictures of men in the book along with very well done ink drawings of
certain officers, maps of battlefields, pictures of spots on the battlefields,
etc. It contains much more information than just the Shiloh battle and I would
like to see that other researchers have the opportunity to access the
information. I am very willing to donate it free of charge to an appropriate
respository as long as it is in Pennsylvania, I think that is where it belongs.
Please respond answers to this list, and thank you.<br>

Whoppee, it was a great night as usual for our Civil War, Letters, Songs and
Poems night. We had quite a few &quot;Newbies&quot; which we thoroughly enjoyed
to the utmost and the Cider was great. We missed you.....<br>
<br>
Again, many thanks to HOST GFS Jayne for getting out the newsletter while I was
in Virginia in April/May. {{{ THANKS JAYNE }}}. I got to do a little trekking
through Portsmouth, Norfolk, Newport News, Hampton, Suffolk and other little
areas around Tidewater Virginia and did I have fun. I just figured out it's
incredibly hard to get a Civil War perspective in an area that had so many Civil
War activities when all of the above towns are one big megatropolis and it's
wall to wall people and very few country lanes unless you get out into the rural
areas. I even did a little wandering through a town called &quot;Great
Bridge&quot; which has huge Revolutionary War historical significance. And last
but not least I found a &quot;local&quot; seafood restaurant over on the York
River in Poquoson, VA just northwest of Hampton. I almost got rural again and it
was great slobberin over steamed shrimp sitting on a dock porch over the York
River..... Hmmm Hmmm<br>

<br>
A Journal extract about an item that occurred near Raymond Mississippi, on
October 23, 1863.<br>
<br>
A Soldier in W.H.T. Walker's division applied for a furlough. Gen'l Walker
disapproved but respectully forwarded to the HdQrts of Gen'l (D.H.) Hill where
it was endorsed as follows: &quot;Approved for the reason that a brave soldier
ought to be allowed to go home whenever practicable, else all the children born
during the war or within the usual period afterwards will be the offspring of
the cowards who remain at home by reason of substitutes or other
exemption.&quot; The soldier went home. I have a notion to apply for furlough
and attach that scrap to it which I have clipped from a newspaper and send it up
and I believe Gen'l Johnston will approve it.<br>

</b>
(these items are extracts from our Letters, Songs, and Poems evenings)
</center></font>
<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Warren was Kentuckian, educated at Vanderbilt, Yale, and Oxford, and
early a member of the literary group called the <i>Fugitives</i>, after a
journal called <i>The Fugitive</i> that they published for a time at Vanderbilt.
He was more ambivalent toward the Southern rural heritage than such fellow
Fugitives as Allen Tate, Donald Davidson, and Andrew Lytle. Two soldiers think
they kill for different reasons and in different spirits. But both of them kill
-- and are killed.<br>

I. Bear Track Plantation: Shortly after Shiloh<br>
<br>
Two things a man's built for, killing and you-know-what.<br>
As for you-know-what, I reckon I taken my share,<br>
Bed-ease or bush-whack, but killing -- hell, three's all I got,<br>
And he promised me ten, Jeff Davis, the bastard. 'Taint fair.<br>
<br>
It ain't fair, a man rides and knows he won't live forever,<br>
And a man needs something to take with him when he dies.<br>
Ain't much worth taking, but what happens under the cover<br>
Or at the steel-point -- yeah, that look in their eyes.<br>
<br>
That same look, it comes in their eyes when you give'em the business.<br>
It's something a man can hang on to, come black-frost or sun.<br>
Come hell or high water, it's something to save from the mess,<br>
No matter whatever else you never got done.<br>
<br>
For a second it seems like a man can know what he lives for,<br>
When those eyelids go waggle, or maybe the eyes pop wide,<br>
And that look comes there. Yeah, Christ, then you know who you are --<br>
And will maybe remember that much even after you've died.<br>
<br>
But now I lie worrying what look my own eyes got<br>
When that Blue-Belly caught me off balance. Did my look mean then<br>
That I'd honed for something not killing or you-know-what?<br>
Hell, no. I'd lie easy if Jeff had just give me that ten.<br>

II. Harvard '61: Battle Fatigue<br>
</b>
<br>
I didn't mind dying -- it wasn't that at all.<br>
It behooves a man to prove manhood by dying for Right.<br>
If you die for Right that fact is your dearest requital,<br>
But you find it disturbing when others die who simply didn't have the Right.<br>
<br>
Why should they die with that obscene incouciance?<br>
The seem in insult the principle of your won death.<br>
Touch pitch, be defiled: It was hard to keep proper distance<br>
From such unprincipled wastrels of blood and profligates of breath.<br>
<br>
I tried to slay without rancor, and often succeeded.<br>
I tried to keep the heart pure, though my hand took stain.<br>
But they made it so hard for me, the way they proceeded<br>
To parody with their own dying that Death which only Right should sustain.<br>
<br>
Time passed. It got worse, It seemed like a plot against me.<br>
I said they had made their own evil bed and lay on it,<br>
But they grinned in the dark -- they grinned -- and I yet see<br>
That last one. A woods edge we held, and over the stubble they came<br>
with bayonet.<br>
<br>
He uttered his yell, he was there! -- teeth yellow, some missing.<br>
Why, he's old as my father, I thought, finger frozen on trigger.<br>
I saw the ambeer on his whiskers, heard the old breath hissing.<br>
The puncture came small on his chest. 'Twas nothing. The stain then got<br>
bigger.<br>
<br>
And he said: &quot;Why, son, you done done it -- I figgered I'd skeered
ye.&quot;<br>
Said: &quot;Son, you look puke-pale. Buck up! If it hadn't been you,<br>
Some other young squirt would a-done it.&quot; I stood, and weirdly<br>
The tumult of battle went soundless, like gesture in dream. And I was<br>
dead, too.<br>
<br>
Dead, and had died for the Right, as I had a right to,<br>
And glad to be dead, and hold my residence<br>
Beyond life's awful illogic, and the world's stew,<br>
Where people who haven't the right just die, with ghastly impertinence.<br>

{{Ted}} You've made my day with that statement. Oddly enough that is not a
rareity with those on distribution. I would hazard a guess that our actual
distribution is 30 - 40% more than actual due to that very &quot;passing
on&quot;. We'll certainly take a peek. Especially in Missouri, I know for a fact
that reenactments occur yearly at Lexington, MO (Battle of Lexington) and
Springfield MO (Battle of Wilson's Creek) as well as Bentonville Ark (just south
of Joplin) (Battle of Pea Ridge or Elkhorn Tavern) occur yearly.</font>

<br>
Could somebody please give me a couple of ideas about someplace to donate the
above mentioned book? I just returned from a trip to California and while there
I bought this book at a flea market. It contains the entire history of the unit,
including the names of all personnel in all companies, where they were enlisted
from, all the battles they fought in, who was wounded or killed, just about
everything someone who had a ancestor in the unit would want to know. There are
also some pictures of men in the book along with very well done ink drawings of
certain officers, maps of battlefields, pictures of spots on the battlefields,
etc. It contains much more information than just the Shiloh battle and I would
like to see that other researchers have the opportunity to access the
information. I am very willing to donate it free of charge to an appropriate
respository as long as it is in Pennsylvania, I think that is where it belongs.
Please respond answers to this list, and thank you.<br>

The Civil War Preservation Trust recently placed the Atlanta site on the top of
its list of America's most endangered battlefields, together with more
endangered battlefields, together with more famous sites like Gettysburg,
Harpers Ferry, W. Va., and Stones River, Tenn.<br>
<br>
Hundreds of yards of trenches and fortifications, nearly intact since they were
built during the siege of Atlanta in 1864 were recently discovered. The
discovery of the area, nestled along the Utoy &quot;Creek in one of the largest
areas of green space left in Atlanta, was a shock. Atlanta's battlefields had
been written off in the 1960s, by which time development has paved nearly all of
the over, leaving nothing but memorial plaques on the edges of bustling
highways. &quot;We all assumed there was nothing left,&quot; says local activist
Bob Price. &quot;The relic hunters knew it was there, but nobody else gave it a
second thought.&quot; Extract from article, A More Civil War by Andrew Curry,

25 May 2002 - Civil War Workshop, Clarksville, TN<br>
From: <a href="mailto:rhyne@east-tennessee-history.org">rhyne@east-tennessee-history.org</a><br>
Whether your ancestors wore blue or gray in the American Civil War, the East
Tennessee Historical Society is offering a free workshop to help find your
family's Civil War story. The free class will be held 2 to 4 p.m. on Saturday,
25 May 2002, at the Clarksville-Montgomery County Public Library in Clarksville,
TN. The instructor, Dr. George K. Schweitzer, is a popular, nationally-known
lecturer and author of 19 genealogy research books.<br>
<br>
Participants will learn how to determine if an ancestor served in the Civil War
and how to locate records for both Confederate and Union veterans. Participants
do not need Tennessee ancestors to participate since the information will be
useful to researchers regardless of their ancestor's home state.<br>
<br>
Why is the East Tennessee Historical Society bringing free genealogy programs to
Middle Tennessee? The classes are a celebration and introduction to a new
statewide initiative sponsored by ETHS to track down descendants of Civil War
soldiers who lived, fought, or died in the Volunteer State. The new heritage
program, &quot;<i>Civil War Families of Tennessee</i>,&quot; celebrates the
unique role of individuals in Tennessee's Civil War story.<br>
<br>
The workshop is co-sponsored locally by the Clarksville-Montgomery County Public
Library. For additional information about the free workshop contact the CMCPL at
931-648-8826 or contact ETHS at 865-215-8824.<br>
<br>
The East Tennessee Historical Society, founded in 1834, is one of the oldest
cultural institutions in the state of Tennessee. ETHS, a non-profit organization
headquartered in Knoxville, is dedicated to preserving, interpreting, and
promoting the history of the region. The society's activities and exhibits are
made possible through the support of its membership.<br>
<br>
For additional information about the genealogy workshops, membership, or other
ETHS programs, call 865-215-8824, or visit the historical society's web site at <a href="http://www.east-tennessee-history.org">http://www.east-tennessee-history.org</a></font></p>

Travel Tips for your Vacationing pleasure...............<br>
<br>
This week I'm covering the state of Alabama. There are a number of points of
interest for your choices.<br>
<br>
I recommend for exact details for finding these areas and what you can see, get
or review a copy of &quot;<i>Smithsonian's Great Battles and Battlefields of the
Civil War - A Definitive Field Guide</i>&quot;.<br>
<br>
Bridgeport - located on US 72, 3 miles east of the Tennessee state line. This
was an important rail depot where the Memphis &amp; Charleston Railroad from the
west crossed the Tennessee River before winding around Lookout Mountain and
entering Charleston. The depot in Stevenson, is about all that is left of this
major rail line area. The depot station is still standing and is a Civil War era
landmark.<br>
<br>
Athens - A Union stronghold on the Central Alabama Railroad. Captured by Maj.
Gen Bedford Forrest in Sept. 1864. Located in north-central Alabama just west
off of I-65 on US 72.<br>
<br>
Decatur - a strategic location for military operations in Alabama, Mississippi
and Tennessee. Sites are the Old Decatur District between Lee Street and the
Tennessee River which is the old wartime town site. Within 80 miles is the
Tannehill State Historical Site, an old Civil War Iron Furnace which supplied
pig iron to the Selma mills.<br>
<br>
Day's Gap and Streight's Raid - The skirmish of Union Col. Abel D. Streight and
Maj. Gen. Nathan B. Forrest at Day Gap just south (aprox 31 miles) of Decatur on
AL 157 as it rises to the Cumberland Plateau.<br>
<br>
Montgomery - This was the town that the Confederate government was created.<br>
<br>
Selma - Manufacturing area for Confederate Cannons and heavy war material.<br>
<br>
Mobile Area - this area is the sites of the Battle of Mobile Bay, Spanish Fort,
Fort Blakeley.<br>
<br>
............. enjoy, and happy traveling!<br>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">THE AMERICAN CIVIL WAR<br>
by Ned Harrison<br>
5-15-02<br>
News &amp; Record<br>
<br>
The American Civil War:<br>
<br>
* saw the introduction of instant communication by electric telegraph.<br>
<br>
* witnessed ships that used steam power to navigate upstream during naval
campaigns.<br>
<br>
* allowed generals to move thousands of men hundreds of miles by rail in only a
few days.<br>
<br>
The American Civil War has rightly been called a transitional war. The
introduction to combat of never-before-used technology transformed warfare as it
had been waged in previous centuries.<br>
<br>
In the next several columns, I am going to discuss and give examples of these
changes. But in this column, I want to write about how the industrial revolution
affected our Civil War.<br>
<br>
Basically, the industrial revolution was a period of change in the way people
lived and worked and farmed. It also determined where they lived and even how
they waged war. It began in England in about 1750, and by 1850, it was over. It
was characterized by new inventions which transformed society from one that was
rural and agricultural into one where people began to move into cities and used
machines to do the work formerly done by hand.<br>
<br>
When the United States was founded in 1789, life in all sections of the country
was about the same. The new nation was essentially rural, with farming the main
occupation of the vast majority of the people. Farm life was difficult, a
never-ending series of chores that had to be done so that a farmer could feed
his family. Most food was grown on the individual farm; clothing, furniture and
farm tools were made in the home for family consumption and use.<br>
<br>
While both North and South were essentially rural and agricultural, Southern
farm life was somewhat easier in that the growing seasons were longer. Slave
labor grew tobacco, rice, indigo and a little wheat, but these crops produced
little wealth. In fact, by 1789, Southern agriculture had reached the point
where a slave's labor no longer paid for his own maintenance.<br>
<br>
Cotton had been the great hope of Southern planters, especially since English
mills were demanding cotton fiber. But the problem was that each cotton boll was
full of little seeds that had to be separated from the fiber. This was
hand-labor at its worst, a time-consuming chore that produced a paltry two
pounds of cotton fiber for 20 hours of work.<br>
<br>
In 1793, Eli Whitney, a Northerner, invented the cotton gin, a simple and
cost-effective machine which replaced the hand labor. It was part of the
industrial revolution and made cotton into a profitable crop. Cotton planting
expanded exponentially and with it, the demand for slaves. The South was thus
wedded even more firmly to slave labor to sustain its way of life.<br>
<br>
And this explains why the two sections of the country reacted differently when
the industrial revolution reached America early in the 19th century. The North,
with a hard-scrabble farming economy, positively inhaled the savings inherent in
machine labor. The South, with an agricultural/slave/people-based economy
primarily devoted to profitable cotton, never really saw the need to integrate
industry into its comfortable plantation life. The South rejected the factories
and the move into cities.<br>
<br>
When the Civil War began, each section followed its own interests: The South
clung to its &quot;King Cotton&quot; economy, confident that it could win any
war in which cotton was a player.<br>
<br>
The North had spent the previous 60 years in its industrialization. Factories in
the state of New York alone produced more goods than the entire South. The
Northern transportation system was fully integrated: it had canals crisscrossing
the region, and a rail system with common trackage that ran no fewer than four
lines from the Atlantic coast to the Mississippi River.<br>
<br>
NORTH CAROLINA AND THE CIVIL WAR<br>
<br>
Warren Dixon of Liberty wrote: &quot;My family, like so many others in N.C., is
made up of Quakers. My 2nd gt (sic) grandfather and his brothers joined the
Confederate forces and, as my gt Aunt told me, my 3rd great grandfather,
although 52, joined, too, to 'see the thing through'. He (Nathan Vestal) and his
son, my 2nd gt grandad, Daniel, joined the 48th N.C. Regiment from Chatham Co.
Another son joined the famous 26th and the other one went into the cavalry. The
Vestals had been Quakers, but had fallen out of favor with the meeting earlier.<br>
<br>
&quot;At a minor skirmish in 1862 sometimes called French's School House (this
is also called Oak Grove or The Orchard. It occurred on June 25, 1862, and was
the opening action of the bloody Seven Days Campaign as Union Gen. George
McClellan tried to capture Richmond and end the war. Ed.) elements of N.Y.
regiments charged the 48th. The 48th, so primed and ready to fight Yankees, left
their positions of relative safety, and charged back. Nathan Vestal was shot in
the head and killed. Confederate records say that he 'fought with marked
bravery'. Gt Aunt Kate said that Daniel and the others tried to bury him on the
battlefield, but 'the Yankees were pushing them so' that they had to leave him,
arms and legs sticking out of the makeshift grave. Daniel ... missed Antietam
(but) ... was wounded at Fredericksburg.&quot;<br>
<br>
Dixon added more to his account: &quot;About the same time in Chatham, good
Quaker Caleb Dixon, who lived near the Vestals, sent his son to the coast...(to
avoid) conscription. The son, Jesse Dixon, was supposed to go to Indiana ...
where it was safe. He went to Indiana, all right, but joined Northern forces
there and fought throughout the war. When it was over, he came back to Chatham
and lived next door to Daniel Vestal.&quot;<br>
<br>
And to close this marvelous story, &quot;Vestals eventually married Dixons ...
and created me. I think this says a lot for the complicated nature of war.&quot;<br>
<br>
It does indeed.<br>

I've just finished one of the most powerful stories of a wartime life that I've
read in a long time. It is reminiscent of <i>COLD MOUNTAIN</i>, and though
defined as a novel, the truth bombards its way through every sentence and every
page. Although a woman's story, this is a must read for all CW enthusiasts,
especially for those of us who have a history in those outskirt states, Missouri
and Kansas. A heartbreaking part of the war that until now, no one has told. It
was a BOMC selection recently, so will receive the wide readership that it
deserves<br>

This week we're shifting over to the state of ARKANSAS. There are a number of
points of interest for your choices.<br>
<br>
I recommend for exact details for finding these areas and what you can see, get
or review a copy of &quot;<i>Smithsonian's Great Battles and Battlefields of the
Civil War - A Definitive Field Guide</i>&quot;.<br>
<br>
Pea Ridge - This National Military Park is right on the Missouri/Arkansas border
just north of Rogers, Ark. On US Highway 62. The Battle of Pea Ridge or
sometimes known as the Battle of Elkhorn Tavern is the largest military park
west of the Mississippi River.<br>
<br>
Prairie Grove - The Prairie Grove Battlefield State Park is on US Highway 62 at
Prairie Grove just 10 miles southwest of Fayetteville, Ark.<br>
<br>
Canehill - This area was a running fight between Blunt's force and Marmaduke's
cavalry covering about 12 miles beginning at Canehill and running across the
mountainous region south to Cove Creek. There are Historical Markers in Canehill
which interpret the action and the Canehill Cemetery where some of the
fatalities were buried.<br>
<br>
Fort Smith National Historical Site - Fort Smith is most famous for its role in
the settlement of the Indian Territory before and after the Civil War; however,
the second fort was seized by the Confederates in 1861. Located on the Arkansas
River, there is a visitor center with museum. Use I 40 to reach Fort Smith.<br>
<br>
Arkansas Post - Arkansas Post National Memorial is south of Little Rock on US
Hwy 65 then north on US Hwy 165. The park has a visitor's center and paths with
interpretative signs.<br>
<br>
Helena - Battle of Helena occurred on July 4, 1863. Helena (on the Mississippi
River) can be reached from Us Hwy 49. The Tourist Information Center provides
additional information on Helena's Civil War Role.<br>
<br>
Little Rock - Finally taken over by Federal troops in Sept 1863, there is much
to see in Little Rock. The old State Capital, the Little Rock Arsenal (which is
now the Arkansas Museum of Science and History) and the Quapaw Quarter.<br>
<br>
The Camden Campaign - this campaign is a car tour which is a loop starting from
Little Rock traveling south on US Hwy 67 to the intersection of State Hwy 53.
The first actions were at Elkin's Ferry, Prairie D'Ane and Moscow, then Poison
Spring Monument State Park. From there drive on into Camden to tour some of the
preserved earthworks and some restored old houses. From Camden drive on up to
Marks' Mills Battleground Historic Monument State Park and then on to Jenkins'
Ferry Monument State Park. That will conclude the areas of the Camden Campaign<br>
<br>
Old Washington Historic State Park - is an interesting 19th century museum
village with buildings, grounds, and a cemetery, located about 9 miles north of
I-30 on AR Hwy 4.<br>
<br>
Chalk Bluff Park - the battle fought at the conclusion of Marmaduke's raid into
Missouri just as he was re-entering Arkansas from Missouri. This park is in the
extreme northeast corner of Arkansas and can be combined with a tour of New
Madrid and Cape Girardeau, Missouri.<br>
<br>
............. enjoy, and happy traveling!<br>

<center><b>&quot;Kentucky Belle&quot;<br>
</b>
by Constance Fenimore Woolson (1840-1894)<br>
</center><br>
A narrative, anti-war poem by a popular poet and novelist of Ohio who, after the
war, lived for a time in the South. The event can be precisely dated. In July
1863, while the battle of Gettysburg was going on, Confederate raider John Hunt
Morgan, a Kentuckian, led a cavalry force into Ohio. He was pursued by troops
from Michigan and captured. He spent four months in the Ohio state prison before
breaking out and rejoining the Confederate forces.<br>
<br>
<center>Summer of 'sixty-three, sir, and Conrad was gone away --<br>
Gone to the county town, sir, to sell our first load of hay.<br>
We lived in the log house yonder, poor as ever you've seen;<br>
Roschen there was a baby, and I was only nineteen.<br>
<br>
Conrad, he took the oxen, but he left Kentucky Belle;<br>
How much we thought of Kentuck, I couldn't begin to tell --<br>
Came from the Bluegrass country; my father gave her to me<br>
When I rode north with Conrad, away from the Tennessee.<br>
<br>
Conrad lived in Ohio--a German he is, you know --<br>
The house stood in broad cornfields, stretching on, row after row;<br>
The old folks made me welcome; they were kind as kind could be;<br>
But I kept longing, longing, for the hills of Tennessee<br>
<br>
O, for a sight of water, the shadowed slope of a hill!<br>
Clouds that hang on the summit, a wind that never is still!<br>
But the level land went stretching away to meet the sky--<br>
Never a rise, from north to south, to rest the weary eye!<br>
<br>
From east to west, no river to shine out under the moon,<br>
Nothing to make a shadow in the yellow afternoon;<br>
Only the breathless sunshine, as I looked out, all forlorn,<br>
Only the &quot;rustle, rustle,&quot; as I walked among the corn.<br>
<br>
When I fell sick with pining we didn't wait any more,<br>
But moved away from the cornlands out to this river shore --<br>
The Tuscarawas it's called, sir -- off there's a hill, you see --<br>
And now I've grown to like it next best to the Tennessee.<br>
<br>
I was at work that morning. Someone came riding like mad<br>
Over the bridge and up the road -- Farmer Rouf's little lad.<br>
Bareback he rode; he had no hat; he hardly stopped to say,<br>
&quot;Morgan's men are coming, Frau, they're galloping on this way&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm sent to warn the neighbors. He isn't a mile behind;<br>
He sweeps up all the horses -- every horse he can find;<br>
Morgan, Morgan the raider, and Morgan's terrible men,<br>
With bowie knives and pistols, are galloping up the glen.&quot;<br>
<br>
The lad rode down the valley, and I stood still at the door --<br>
The baby laughed and prattled, playing with spools on the floor;<br>
Kentuck was out in the pasture; Conrad, my man was gone;<br>
Near, near Morgan's men were galloping, galloping on!<br>
<br>
Sudden I picked up baby and ran to the pasture bar:<br>
&quot;Kentuck!&quot; I called; &quot;Kentucky!&quot; She knew me ever so far!<br>
I led her down the gully that turns off there to the right,<br>
And tied her to the bushes; her head was just out of sight.<br>
<br>
As I ran back to the log house at once there came a sound --<br>
The ring of hoofs, galloping hoofs, trembling over the ground,<br>
Coming into the turnpike out from the White-Woman Glen --<br>
Morgan, Morgan the raider, and Morgan's terrible men.<br>
<br>
As near they drew and nearer my heart beat fast in alarm;<br>
But still I stood in the doorway, with baby on my arm.<br>
The came; they passed; with spur and whip in haste they sped along;<br>
Morgan, Morgan the raider, and his band six hundred strong.<br>
<br>
Weary they looked and jaded, riding through night and through day;<br>
Pushing on east to the river, many long miles away,<br>
To the border strip where Virginia runs up into the west,<br>
And for the Upper Ohio before they could stop to rest.<br>
<br>
On like the wind they hurried, and Morgan rode in advance;<br>
Bright were his eyes like live coals, as he gave me a sideways glance;<br>
And I was just breathing freely, after my choking pain,<br>
When the last one of the troopers suddenly drew his rein.<br>
<br>
Frightened I was to death, sir; I scarce dared look in his face,<br>
As he asked for a drink of water and glanced around the place;<br>
I gave him a cup, and he smiled -- 'twas only a boy, you see,<br>
Faint and worn, with dim blue eyes; and he'd sailed on the Tennessee.<br>
<br>
Only sixteen he was, sir -- a fond mother's only son --<br>
Off and away with Morgan before his life had begun!<br>
The damp drops stood on his temples; drawn was the boyish mouth;<br>
And I thought me of the mother waiting down in the South!<br>
<br>
O, pluck was he to the backbone and clear grit through and through;<br>
Boasted and bragged like a trooper; but the big words wouldn't do;<br>
The boy was dying, sir, dying, as plain as plain could be,<br>
Worn out by his ride with Morgan up from the Tennessee.<br>
<br>
But, when I told the laddie that I too was from the South,<br>
Water came in his dim eyes and quivers around his mouth,<br>
&quot;Do you know the Bluegrass country?&quot; he wistful began to say,<br>
Then swayed like a willow sapling and fainted dead away.<br>
<br>
I had him into the log house, and worked and brought him to;<br>
I fed him and coaxed him, as I thought his mother'd do;<br>
And, when the lad got better, and the noise in his head was gone,<br>
Morgan's men were miles away, galloping, galloping on.<br>
<br>
&quot;O, I must go,&quot; he muttered; &quot;I must be up and away!<br>
Morgan, Morgan is waiting for me! O, what will Morgan say?&quot;<br>
But I heard a sound of tramping and kept him back from the door--<br>
The ringing sound of houses' hoofs that I had heard before.<br>
<br>
And on, on came the soldiers -- the Michigan cavalry --<br>
And fast they rode, and black they looked galloping rapidly;<br>
They had followed hard on Morgan's track; they had followed day and night;<br>
But of Morgan and Morgan's raiders they had never caught a sight.<br>
<br>
And rich Ohio sat startled through all those summer days,<br>
For strange, wild men were galloping over her broad highways;<br>
Now here, now there, now seen, now gone, now north, now east, now west,<br>
Through river valleys and corn-land farms, sweeping away her best.<br>
<br>
A bold ride and a long ride! But they were taken at last.<br>
They almost reached the river by galloping hard and fast;<br>
But the boys in blue were upon them ere ever they gained the ford,<br>
And Morgan, Morgan the raider, laid down his terrible sword.<br>
<br>
Well, I kept the boy till evening -- kept him against his will --<br>
But he was too weak to follow, and sat ther pale and still;<br>
When it was cool and dusky -- you'll wonder to hear me tell --<br>
But I stole down to that gully and brought up Kentucky Belle.<br>
<br>
I kissed the star on her forehead -- my pretty, gentle lass--<br>
But I knew that she'd be happy back in the old Bluegrass;<br>
A suit of clothes of Conrad's, with all the money I had,<br>
And Kentuck, pretty Kentuck, I gave to the worn-out lad.<br>
<br>
I guided him to the southward as well as I knew how;<br>
The boy rode off with many thanks, and many a backward bow;<br>
And then the glow it faded, and my heart began to swell,<br>
As down the glen away she went, my lost Kentucky Belle!<br>
<br>
When Conrad came in the evening the moon was shining high;<br>
Baby and I were both crying -- I couldn't tell him why --<br>
But a battered suit of rebel gray was hanging on the wall,<br>
And a thin old horse with drooping head stood in Kentucky's stall.<br>
<br>
Well, he was kind, and never once said a hard word to me;<br>
He knew I couldn't help it -- 'twas all for the Tennessee;<br>
But, after the war was over, just think what came to pass --<br>
A letter, sir; and the two were safe back in the old Bluegrass.<br>
<br>
The lad had got across the border, riding Kentucky Belle;<br>
And Kentuck she was thriving, and fat, and hearty, and well;<br>
He cared for her, and kept her, nor touched her with whip or spur:<br>
Ah! we've had many horses, but never a horse like her!<br>

[Related to your &quot;<i>Alabama Travel tips</i>&quot;] if anyone is near
Selma, Alabama, I really recommend going to the little &quot;ghost&quot; town of
Cahaba nearby. It was the 1st State Capitol of Alabama and the Cahaba Prison
during the Civil War was there. Really is worth the side trip. It is located
just a few miles to the south-west of Selma. Also at Mobile there is Forts
Morgan and Gaines which are well worth the visit also.<br>

Taps<br>
I have never seen the words to Taps nor heard the story before.<br>
It sure is a beautiful story.<br>
<br>
We have all heard the haunting song, &quot;<i>Taps</i>.&quot; It's the song that
gives us that lump in our throats and usually creates tears in our eyes. But, do
you know the story behind the song? If not, I think you will be pleased to find
out about it's humble beginnings.<br>
<br>
Reportedly, it all began in 1862 during the Civil War, when Union Army Captain
Robert Ellicombe was with his men near Harrison's Landing in Virginia. The
Confederate Army was on the other side of the narrow strip of land. During the
night, Captain Ellicombe heard the moans of a soldier who lay severely wounded
on the field. Not knowing if it was a Union or Confederate soldier, Captain
Ellicombe decided to risk his life and bring the stricken man back for medical
attention.<br>
<br>
Crawling on his stomach through the gunfire, the Captain reached the stricken
soldier and began pulling him toward his encampment. When the Captain finally
reached his own lines, he discovered it was actually a Confederate soldier, but
the soldier was dead. The Captain lit a lantern and suddenly caught his breath
and went numb with shock. In the dim light, he saw the face of the soldier. It
was his own son. The boy had been studying music in the South when war broke
out. Without telling his father, the boy enlisted in the Confederate Army.<br>
<br>
The following morning, heartbroken, the father asked permission of his superiors
to give his son a full military burial despite his enemy status.<br>
<br>
His request was only partially granted. Captain Ellicombe had asked if he could
have a group of Army band members play a funeral dirge for his son at the
funeral. The request was turned down since the soldier was a Confederate.<br>
<br>
But, out of respect for the father, they did say they could give him only one
musician. The Captain chose a bugler. He asked the bugler to play a series of
musical notes he had found on a piece of paper in the pocket of the dead youth's
uniform. This wish was granted. The haunting melody, we now know as
&quot;Taps&quot; used at military funerals, and at the end of each day on US
military bases was born.<br>
<br>
Day is done.......Gone the sun........From the lakes.......<br>
From the hills.........From the skies.<br>
All is well, Safely rest.......God is nigh........<br>
<br>
Fading light..........Dims the sight........And a star.........<br>
Gems the sky,..........Gleaming bright<br>
From afar, Drawing nigh, Falls the night.<br>
<br>
Thanks and praise, For our days, Neath the sun,<br>
Neath the stars, Neath the sky,<br>
As we go, This we know, God is nigh.<br>
<br>
I too, have felt the chills while listening to &quot;<i>Taps</i>&quot; but I
have never seen all the words until now. I didn't even know there was more than
one verse.<br>
<br>
I also never knew the story behind the song and I didn't know if you had either
so I thought I'd pass it along.<br>

{{{Pink}}} This is a neat story and for the readers, this is one of two stories
about the origin of TAPS. The generally accepted version is that Butterworth
(can't remember his rank or first name) wrote the bugle call and words after the
battle of Gettysburg. When I went to visit Fort Monroe at Hampton, Virginia;
inside the post Chapel, there is a stained glass window commemorating
Butterworth's writting of TAPS....</i></font></p>
