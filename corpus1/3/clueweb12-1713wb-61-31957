          <div id="main"><span class="big-bold">United States Electoral Process</span>
            <p>An election is the process by which citizens select the thousands of 
              men and women they want to run their government--at all levels. In a democracy, 
              government officials are chosen by the people and serve for a specific 
              time called a term of office. Depending on state laws, an official may 
              run for reelection once the term is over. Our system of government is 
              called a representative democracy. American citizens do not directly make 
              governmental decisions. They elect officials to govern for them. Most 
              elections in our country are held on the first Tuesday after the first 
              Monday in November. But elections for public offices may be held at any 
              time, depending on state law.</p>
            <p>When the Constitution was written in 1787, it basically left the decision 
              
              to each state as to who could vote in elections. Most states did not at 
              
              first give the right to vote to women or African Americans.</p>
            <p>In 1870, five years after the end of the Civil War, the 15th Amendment 
              
              was passed. This amendment guaranteed the right to vote to male African 
              
              Americans. However, it took another 100 years for African Americans to 
              
              be able to fully exercise this right.</p>
            <p>American women were not allowed to vote at the national level until 1920. 
              
              The 19th Amendment to the Constitution was passed that year, and the following 
              
              November millions of American women voted in the presidential election 
              
              for the first time.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The 26th Amendment to the Constitution, adopted in 1971, says that anyone 
              
              over 18 is allowed to vote.</p>
            <p>In 1965, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act. This law guaranteed that 
              the federal government would intervene if any state attempted to deny 
              a citizen's voting rights because of race. As a result of this act, millions 
              of African Americans in the South were allowed to register to vote for 
              the first time.</p>
            <p>On the average, about 60% of voting-age Americans vote in presidential 
              
              elections. For local elections, voter turn out is usually much lower.</p>
            <p>No political parties officially existed when the U.S. Constitution was 
              written in the late 1780s. The founders of the country actually felt that 
              political parties were not a good thing and that they would divide people 
              against each other and harm the democracy. However within 10 years after 
              the Constitution was written, the U.S. had two major political parties--the 
              Federalist party that was a proponent of a strong central government--and 
              the Democratic-Republican party (also called the Anti-Federalist Party) 
              that supported strong state governments. The Democratic-Republican party 
              eventually became known as the Democratic party. The Whig party developed 
              in the 1830s in opposition to President Andrew Jackson and his policies. 
              The Whig party eventually split apart, mainly over the issue of slavery. 
              Proslavery Whigs rejoined the Democratic party and many antislavery Whigs 
              formed a new party in 1854 called the Republican party. Abraham Lincoln 
              was the first Republican president.</p>
            <p>Today, the Democrats and Republicans remain the two leading parties in 
              our country. However, there are other political parties such as the Independent 
              Party, the Reform Party, the Libertarian Party, the Green Party, the Socialist 
              Party, the Populist Party, and others.</p>
            <p>When you vote for a mayor, senator, a member of the House of Representatives, 
              
              a judge, etc. you are voting directly for that person. However, when you 
              
              vote for president, you are really voting for an elector who has pledged 
              
              to represent that candidate. The electors chosen by each state are called 
              
              the electoral college. They are a group of people who officially elect 
              
              the president and vice president. Each state has as many votes in the 
              
              electoral college as it has senators and members of the House of Representatives. 
              
              For example, Utah has 2 senators and 3 members of the House of Representatives--so 
              
              it has 5 electoral votes. Large states like California have more than 
              
              50 electoral votes. States small in population like Alaska only have 3 
              
              electoral votes. To be elected, a presidential candidate must put together 
              
              enough states in the election to get a majority (more than half of the 
              
              total) of the electoral college. Even though the American public knows 
              
              the winner of the presidential election on the actual day of the election 
              
              in November, that winner is not really yet official. The electoral college 
              
              meets officially in December. Its votes are sealed and sent to the U.S. 
              
              Senate. When the Congress meets in January, the current vice president 
              
              of the United States unseals the envelope and announces the results to 
              
              the Senate. This is the official moment at which the president and vice 
              
              president are really elected.</p>

          <span class="small"> In 1868, Thomas Edison  invented the first machine

              for when they voted on bills and resolutions. It would have speeded up 
              the process of voting out loud. But the lawmakers rejected it because

                  who felt that Taft was too conservative formed a new party called the

                  the Democratic-Republican party or Anti-Federalist party. The Anti-Federalist 
                  
                  party favored a weaker central government and strong state governments. 
                  
                  It was allied with small farmers rather than business people. Thomas Jefferson 
                  
                  was a member of the Anti-Federalist party. Are the original tenents of

                  for president must have a majority of the votes of the electoral college. 
                  
                  If no candidate receives a majority of the Electoral College votes, the 
                  
                  president is then chosen directly by the House of Representatives. If 
                  
                  this happens, each state gets just one vote. </span></div>

              enemies during his eight years in the White House. Opponents to President 
              Jackson developed the Whig party which opposed the ideas of a pwerful 
              presidency. Instead, they wanted Congress to be the strongest branch of 
              government.</span>            </div>
