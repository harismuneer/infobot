  <p class=MsoTitle>Electoral College: Is this a democratic way to pick a president?<br>

  <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='line-height:200%;tab-stops:.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The
right to vote is fundamental to our democracy.  I can remember the first time I
exercised this right.  I was proud to finally participate in a process that has
kept our democracy the envy of the world.  The election that I voted in was
unusual, however.  For the last 100 years, the presidential candidate who won
the most popular votes won the election, but this time things were different.<span
class=MsoEndnoteReference> <a href="#_edn1" name="_ednref1" title="">[i]</a></span>
 The candidate who won the presidency in the 2000 presidential election, George
W. Bush, actually received fewer popular votes than the losing candidate, Al
Gore.  This raises some interesting questions: is the process by which
Americans currently elect presidents democratic?  If all Americans are equal,
should not one American equal one vote?  Does the Electoral College work, even
though it disproportionably represents the votes of some Americans, or should
we switch to a direct voting system? </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='line-height:200%;tab-stops:.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There
is some support for keeping the current system.  One benefit is that generally,
the Electoral College adds legitimacy to the winner of the popular vote by
exaggerating the margin of the victory.  For example, the Electoral College
made it look as if John F. Kennedy was the clear winner of the 1960 presidential
election.  He received 303 electoral votes, while his opponent, Richard Nixon,
received only 219 electoral votes.<span class=MsoEndnoteReference>i</span>  The
popular vote, on the other hand, was much closer: John F. Kennedy received <span
style='color:black'>49.72% of the popular vote, while Richard Nixon received
49.55% of the popular vote.<a href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference>[ii]</span></a></span><span style='font-size:16.0pt;
color:black'>  </span>However, the winner of the most popular votes is not
always the winner of the Electoral College.  There have been four cases, one
being the last election, where the winner of the most popular votes lost the
presidency.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='line-height:200%;tab-stops:.5in'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another
conceivable benefit of the Electoral College is that it can lessen the negative
effects of third-party candidates who have no chance of winning.  In order to
win the presidency you have to win over half of the available electoral votes:
270 electors of the 538 electoral votes.  A direct voting system makes it
significantly more difficult for a candidate to win a majority.  The winner
still has to receive over half of the available votes.  What does this mean? 
Currently, under the Electoral College, for better or worse, third-party
candidates rarely interfere with the election results.  The 1996 and 1992
presidential elections illustrate this point.  The winner, in both of these
elections, succeeded in winning over half of the necessary electoral votes, while
failing to win over 50% of the popular vote.<a href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>[iii]</span></a>  This happens,
because even if a third party candidate is running strong nationally, let us
say 20% of the popular vote, he or she has to win a majority in an individual
state to receive a single vote in the Electoral College.  Without the Electoral
College, runoff elections in both 1992 and 1996 would have been needed.  This
definitely is another inconvenience of eliminating the Electoral College, but
the more important question is, inconveniences aside, does the Electoral
College have the &#8220;right&#8221; candidate win, whomever that may be?  </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;tab-stops:.5in'>The
problem comes when determining who is the &#8220;right&#8221; candidate. 
Critics of the Electoral College often point to the fact that Gore won by
roughly 1/3 of a million votes, and still lost the presidency.  In a direct
election, all the votes would go in the same pot and Gore would have won.  Why
continue the archaic practice of electing the president with the Electoral
College when the technology exists to have all the votes placed in the same
pot?  Although eliminating the Electoral College would seem to be fairer, in
actuality that could not be farther from the truth.  The process may seem
somewhat unfair, but the results are more important than the appearance of the
process.  The results of eliminating the Electoral College are far-reaching and
unpleasant.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;tab-stops:.5in'>If
the Electoral College were eliminated, campaigns would change.  Grassroots
efforts would disappear for they would no longer really serve a valuable
purpose.  Currently, grassroots efforts, which involve Americans in the
political process, are responsible for swinging highly contested states for one
candidate or another.  Their efforts change the results of the Electoral
College significantly more than the results of the popular vote, because under
the Electoral College a state can only send its electors to vote for one
candidate.  In a direct election, these grassroots efforts would lose their
significance.  Americans can expect increased national polling to determine
what the most popular view is, and an unprecedented amount of money spent in
densely populated states.  Oh, and let us not forget the endless TV commercials
of political candidates championing the causes of the latest public opinion
poll.    </p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;tab-stops:.5in'>Candidates
run for president to win.  It may be an unfortunate truth, but money matters;
running a cost-effective campaign is essential to winning.  Currently, the
Electoral College provides an incentive for candidates to win the majority of
the voters in all of the states and not only the popular vote, regardless of
the state.  When running a cost-effective campaign, there is no logical reason
to waste valuable advertising dollars in states like Maine when the money can
be spent in densely populated states like New York or California.  Politicians
no longer have to concern themselves with individual states&#8217; issues if
the Electoral College is eliminated.  Sure, with a direct voting system votes
are &#8220;equal,&#8221; but there are even fewer incentives for politicians to
pay attention to the needs of smaller states.  Moreover, minority populations
are generally clumped within certain states.  This means that even if on the
national level they only make up a small percentage of the vote, in certain
states, they make all the difference to winning.  In the eyes of a politician
attempting to win the presidency without the Electoral College, smaller states
and minority voters, which currently matter, would no longer matter, and
consequently every vote would not be equal under a direct voting system.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;tab-stops:.5in'>Nightmare
scenarios begin to emerge if the densely populated areas along the east and
west coast begin to control the nation and the nation becomes divided.  The
division is not as improbable as it may at first appear.  In the last
presidential election, Bush won 30 of 50 states and lost the popular vote.  A
majority of the people in 3/5 of the states favored Bush, but under a
direct-voting system, he would have lost the election.  This could become more
extreme.  Imagine a president losing 4/5 of the states and winning the
election.  Is this American?  Targeting only the majority of American voters
could create deep divisions along state lines.  The president should be the
leader of the nation as a whole and not over a particularly densely populated region.
 The president should have the support of the majority of the people in the
states so that one state&#8217;s citizens are not sacrificed for the citizens
of another.  Eliminating the Electoral College undermines these principles. 
Every voter should matter.  Every vote should be valued, not just the votes of
highly populated states, not just the voters of California and Texas, but also
the voters of Maine and Connecticut.</p>

<p class=MsoHeader style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%;tab-stops:.5in'>We
live in a Representative Democracy, a Republic.  Americans are not in favor of
eliminating the Senate, because it is not fair to the states with a larger
population, nor are Americans from smaller states suggesting that eliminating
the House of Representatives would make America more democratic.  Most
Americans respect the importance of the balance of power between states&#8217;
rights and the rights of the population as a whole.  This balance of power in
our legislature has served our nation well.  The Electoral College is nothing
more than a continuation of these principles because states receive one
electoral vote for each member of the House of Representatives and the Senate,
which totals 538 electors (435 House + 100 Senate + 3 District of Columbia).<a
href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference>i</span></a>
 The founders of our country divided the legislature&#8217;s power to guard the
less populated states from those with a greater share of the population.  To
argue that the Electoral College is undemocratic or not American is not far
from arguing that the distribution of power in our nation&#8217;s legislature
is undemocratic and needs reform.  The Electoral College is nothing more than a
combination of two essential components of our democracy.  The Electoral
College strikes a delicate balance between the rights of the minority and the
majority so that all voices are heard.</p>
