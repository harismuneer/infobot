</TD><TD align=center>[1] 24k<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>[2] 62k</TD><TD colspan="2">William Richard "Rich" Higgins was born in Kentucky on January 15, 1945. He graduated from Southern High School in Louisville and earned his bacelor's degree from Miami University, Oxford, Ohio. A scholarship student in the Navy ROTC, he received the Marine Corps Association Award and was commissioned in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1967. He later obtained master's degrees from Pepperdine University and Auburn University. Rich graduated from the Army Infantry Officers Advanced Course, the Air Force Command and Staff College and the National War College. As a lieutenant, Rich participated in combat operations during 1968 in Vietnam as a rifle platoon commander and rifle company executive officer. A decisive and respected officer, Rich was distinguished as a leader who never asked his troops for more than he himself would give. After serving as the Officer-in-Charge of the Officer Selection Team in Louisville, Kentucky, Captain Higgins returned to Vietnam as an infantry battalion advisor to the Vietnamese Marine Corps, and later as a rifle company commander. After returning from Vietnam, Rich served at the Staff Noncommissioned Officers Academy and Officers Candidates School in Quantico, Virginia. Rich returned to Washington in 1980, where he served at Marine Headquarters as a Plans Officer until his selection to the Office of the Secretary of Defense. After graduation from the National War College in 1985, he again returned to the Pentagon, serving as the Military Assistant to the Secretary of Defense until he was transferred to a United Nations assignment in July 1987. In Naqoura, South Lebanon, LtCol Higgins began serving what was to be a twelve-month tour as Chief Observer Group Lebanon with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organization, peacekeeping force consisting of military officers from 17 nations. As a combat veteran, Rich welcomed the opportunity to serve with troops again, believing that one person could truly make a significant difference in the peace process. It was an extremely dangerous assignment for an American officer. The militant terrorist group Hezbollah routinely patrolled the area and tensions were high. A fellow officer in the Canadian Army approached LtCol Higgins shortly after his arrival. He was concerned for Rich's safety and had made some adhesive patches of the Canadian flag. If Rich found himself in danger, he could quickly place one over the American flag on his uniform, perhaps giving him extra time to escape. He did not waiver, LtCol Higgins explained that he was a United States Marine and if captured or killed, it would be under the American flag. On February 17, 1988, LtCol Higgins was abducted by Hezbollah. He was Promoted to colonel on March 1, 1989, but never knew it. The exact date of his death is uncertain; however, he was declared dead on July 6, 1990. His remains were eventually recovered and interred at Quantico National Cemetery on December 30, 1991. The tireless commitment Col Higgins had to duty and country is best conveyed by the small plaque that he kept on his desk. It reads: <i>War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things; the decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse. A man who has nothing for which he is willing to fight, nothing he cares about more than his own personal safety, is a miserable creature who has no chance of being free, unless made and kept so by the exertions of better men than himself</i>.</TD><TD>[1] Steven A.
