                              &nbsp;&nbsp;This is property that produces investment income. Examples include stocks, bonds, and Treasury bills and notes. Property
                        used in a trade or business is not investment property.
                        <p></p>
                     </div>
                     <div class="section" lang="en"><b class="title"><a name="en_US_2011_publink100010303"></a>Form 1099-B.</b><a class="indexterm" name="d0e9515"></a><a class="indexterm" name="d0e9518"></a>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;If you sold property such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or certain commodities through a broker during the year,
                        you should receive, for each sale, a Form 1099-B, Proceeds From Broker and Barter Exchange Transactions, or substitute statement,
                        from the broker. You should receive the statement by February 15 of the next year. It will show the gross proceeds from the
                        sale. The IRS will also get a copy of Form 1099-B from the broker.
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Use Form 1099-B (or substitute statement received from your broker) to complete Form 8949. If you sold a covered security
                        in 2011, your broker will send you a Form 1099-B (or substitute statement) that shows your basis. This will help you complete
                        Form 8949. Generally, a covered security is a security you acquired after 2010, with certain exceptions explained in the 2011
                        Instructions for Schedule D.

                           can file a claim for a credit or refund due to the loss. You must use Form 1040X, Amended U.S. Individual Income Tax Return,
                           to amend your return for the year the security became worthless. You must file it within 7 years from the date your original
                           return for that year had to be filed, or 2 years from the date you paid the tax, whichever is later. (Claims not due to worthless
                           securities or bad debts generally must be filed within 3 years from the date a return is filed, or 2 years from the date the
                           tax is paid, whichever is later.) For more information about filing a claim, see Publication 556, Examination of Returns,

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The loss is carried to the earliest carryback year first, and any unabsorbed loss amount can then be carried to each
                              of the next 2 tax years. In each carryback year, treat 60% of the carryback amount as a long-term capital loss and 40% as
                              a short-term capital loss from section 1256 contracts.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;If only a portion of the net section 1256 contracts loss is absorbed by carrying the loss back, the unabsorbed portion
                              can be carried forward, under the capital loss carryover rules, to the year following the loss. (See <a name="id2011_id2010_publink1000125869" href="ch04.html#en_US_2011_publink100010729" title="Capital Losses">

                              of 60% of the absorbed loss. In the carryover year, treat any capital loss carryover from losses on section 1256 contracts

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;If you are a limited partner or entrepreneur in a syndicate, the amount of a hedging loss you can claim is limited.
                              A &#8220;<span class="quote">hedging loss</span>&#8221; is the amount by which the allowable deductions in a tax year that resulted from a hedging transaction (determined without

                              <p></p>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Any hedging loss allocated to you for the tax year is limited to your taxable income for that year from the trade
                              or business in which the hedging transaction occurred. Ignore any hedging transaction items in determining this taxable income.
                              If you have a hedging loss that is disallowed because of this limit, you can carry it over to the next tax year as a deduction
                              resulting from a hedging transaction.
                              <p></p>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;If the hedging transaction relates to property other than stock or securities, the limit on hedging losses applies
                              if the limited partner or entrepreneur is an individual.
                              <p></p>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The limit on hedging losses does not apply to any hedging loss to the extent that it is more than all your unrecognized
                              gains from hedging transactions at the end of the tax year that are from the trade or business in which the hedging transaction
                              occurred. The term &#8220;<span class="quote">unrecognized gain</span>&#8221; has the same meaning as defined under <a name="id2011_id2010_publink1000131289" href="ch04.html#en_US_2011_publink100010640" title="Loss Deferral Rules">

                           <p>You bought 100 shares of stock of XYZ Corporation in 1996 for $10 a share. In January 1997 you bought another 200 shares for
                              $11 a share. In July 1997 you gave your son 50 shares. In December 1999 you bought 100 shares for $9 a share. In April 2011
                              you sold 130 shares. You cannot identify the shares you disposed of, so you must use the stock you acquired first to figure
                              the basis. The shares of stock you gave your son had a basis of $500 (50 &times; $10). You figure the basis of the 130 shares of
                              stock you sold in 2011 as follows:

                           divide the adjusted basis of the old stock by the number of shares of old and new stock. The result is your basis for each

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;OID on tax-exempt obligations is generally not taxable. However, when you dispose of a tax-exempt obligation issued
                           after September 3, 1982, that you acquired after March 1, 1984, you must accrue OID on the obligation to determine its adjusted
                           basis. The accrued OID is added to the basis of the obligation to determine your gain or loss.
                           <p></p>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;For information on determining OID on a long-term obligation, see <span class="emphasis"><em>Debt Instruments Issued After July 1, 1982, and Before 1985</em></span> or <span class="emphasis"><em>Debt Instruments Issued After 1984</em></span>, whichever applies, in Publication 1212 under <span class="emphasis"><em>Figuring OID on Long-Term Debt Instruments</em></span>.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;If the tax-exempt obligation has a maturity of 1 year or less, accrue OID under the rules for acquisition discount
                           on short-term obligations. See <a name="id2011_id2010_publink1000125882" href="ch01.html#en_US_2011_publink100010026" title="Discount on Short-Term Obligations">

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;If you acquired a stripped tax-exempt bond or coupon after October 22, 1986, you must accrue OID on it to determine

                           this OID may be taxable. You accrue the OID on these obligations in the manner described in chapter 1 under <a name="id2011_id2010_publink1000131291" href="ch01.html#en_US_2011_publink100010010" title="Stripped Bonds and Coupons">

                           your basis by the interest that accrued (but was not paid and was not previously reflected in your basis) before the date
                           you sold the bond or coupon. In addition, for bonds acquired after June 10, 1987, add to your basis any accrued market discount
                           not previously reflected in basis.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;The amount you realize from a sale or trade of property is everything you receive for the property minus your expenses
                        of sale (such as redemption fees, sales commissions, sales charges, or exit fees). Amount realized includes the money you
                        receive plus the fair market value of any property or services you receive.
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;If you finance the buyer's purchase of your property and the debt instrument does not provide for adequate stated
                        interest, the unstated interest that you must report as ordinary income will reduce the amount realized from the sale. For
                        more information, see Publication 537.
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;If a buyer of property issues a debt instrument to the seller of the property, the amount realized is determined by
                        reference to the issue price of the debt instrument, which may or may not be the fair market value of the debt instrument.
                        See Regulations section 1.1001-1(g). However, if the debt instrument was previously issued by a third party (one not part
                        of the sale transaction), the fair market value of the debt instrument is used to determine the amount realized.

                           of those shares. If your shares in a mutual fund were acquired all on the same day and for the same price, figuring their

                           Therefore, figuring your basis can be more difficult. You can choose to use either a cost basis or an average basis to figure

                           <p>On July 26, 2011, RGB Corporation divests itself of SFH Corporation. You hold 75 shares of RGB stock with a basis of $5,400.
                              You receive 25 shares of SFH stock as a result of the spin-off. You do not recognize any gain or loss on the transaction.
                              You receive information from RGB Corporation that your basis in SFH stock is equal to 10.9624% of your basis in RGB stock
                              ($5,400). Thus, your basis in SFH stock is $592.00. Your basis in RGB stock (after the spin-off) is $4,808 ($5,400 &#8211; $592).

                              </p>
                              <p>On December 2, you subscribed to the bond, which was issued on December 9. The bond contained a clause stating that you would
                                 receive one share of XYZ Corporation common stock on surrender of one bond and the payment of $50.

                              <p>Later, you presented the bond and $50 and received one share of XYZ Corporation common stock. You did not have a recognized
                                 gain or loss. This is true whether the fair market value of the stock was more or less than $150 on the date of the conversion.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, if you convert the bonds of one corporation into common stock of another corporation, according to the
                           terms of the bond issue, you must recognize gain or loss up to the difference between the fair market value of the stock received
                           and the adjusted basis of the bonds exchanged. In some instances, however, such as trades that are part of mergers or other
                           corporate reorganizations, you will have no recognized gain or loss if certain requirements are met. For more information

                           such as those just described, consult the respective corporations and the terms of the bond issue. This information is also
                           available on the prospectus of the bond issue.

                           other than a reorganization, you must recognize gain to the extent the stock you receive in the exchange is used to pay off
                           your debts.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;You need to classify your gains and losses as either ordinary or capital gains or losses. You then need to classify
                        your capital gains and losses as either short term or long term. If you have long-term gains and losses, you must identify
                        your 28% rate gains and losses. If you have a net capital gain, you must also identify any unrecaptured section 1250 gain.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;The correct classification and identification helps you figure the limit on capital losses and the correct tax on
                        capital gains. For information about determining whether your capital gain or loss is short term or long term, see <a name="id2011_id2010_publink1000125893" href="ch04.html#en_US_2011_publink100010540" title="Holding Period">

                           gain or loss, depending on the circumstances. Generally, a sale or trade of a capital asset (defined next) results in a capital
                           gain or loss. A sale or trade of a noncapital asset generally results in ordinary gain or loss. Depending on the circumstances,
                           a gain or loss on a sale or trade of property used in a trade or business may be treated as either capital or ordinary, as
                           explained in Publication 544. In some situations, part of your gain or loss may be a capital gain or loss, and part may be
                           an ordinary gain or loss.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Any gain from market discount is usually taxable on disposition or redemption of tax-exempt bonds. If you bought the
                              bonds before May 1, 1993, the gain from market discount is capital gain. If you bought the bonds after April 30, 1993, the
                              gain from market discount is ordinary income.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;You figure market discount by subtracting the price you paid for the bond from the sum of the original issue price
                              of the bond and the amount of accumulated OID from the date of issue that represented interest to any earlier holders. For

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;An intention to call a debt instrument before maturity means there is a written or oral agreement or understanding
                              not provided for in the debt instrument between the issuer and original holder that the issuer will redeem the debt instrument
                              before maturity. In the case of debt instruments that are part of an issue, the agreement or understanding must be between
                              the issuer and the original holders of a substantial amount of the debt instruments in the issue.

                                 <p>On February 2, 2009, you bought at original issue for $7,600, Jones Corporation's 10-year, 5% bond which has a stated redemption

                                    gross income (including the amount accrued for 2011) and increased your basis in the bond by that amount. Your basis is now
                                    $7,934. If at the time of the original issue there was no intention to call the bond before maturity, your gain of $1,106
                                    ($9,040 amount realized minus $7,934 adjusted basis) is capital gain.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;If you can reasonably estimate your loss, you can choose to treat the estimated loss as either an ordinary loss or
                              a casualty loss in the current year. Either way, you claim the loss as an itemized deduction.
                              <p></p>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;If you claim an ordinary loss, report it as a miscellaneous itemized deduction on Schedule A (Form 1040), line 23.
                              The maximum amount you can claim is $20,000 ($10,000 if you are married filing separately) reduced by any expected state insurance
                              proceeds. Your loss is subject to the 2%-of-adjusted-gross-income limit. You cannot choose to claim an ordinary loss if any
                              part of the deposit is federally insured.
                              <p></p>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;If you claim a casualty loss, attach Form 4684, Casualties and Thefts, to your return. Each loss must be reduced by
                              $100. Your total casualty losses for the year are reduced by 10% of your adjusted gross income.
                              <p></p>

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;A special rule applies when a position with a built-in loss becomes part of a conversion transaction. A built-in loss
                              is any loss you would have realized if you had disposed of or otherwise terminated the position at its fair market value at
                              the time it became part of the conversion transaction.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;When applying the conversion transaction rules to a position with a built-in loss, use the position's fair market
                              value at the time it became part of the transaction. But, when you dispose of or otherwise terminate the position in a transaction
                              in which you recognize gain or loss, you must recognize the built-in loss. The conversion transaction rules do not affect
                              whether the built-in loss is treated as an ordinary or capital loss.

                              of the same conversion transaction. To do this, you have to dispose of all the positions within a 14-day period that is within
                              a single tax year. You cannot net the built-in loss against the gain.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp; A futures contract that is a hedging transaction generally produces ordinary gain or loss. A futures contract is
                              a hedging transaction if you enter into the contract in the ordinary course of your business primarily to manage the risk
                              of interest rate or price changes or currency fluctuations on borrowings, ordinary property, or ordinary obligations. (Generally,
                              ordinary property or obligations are those that cannot produce capital gain or loss under any circumstances.) For example,
                              the offset or exercise of a futures contract that protects against price changes in your business inventory results in an
                              ordinary gain or loss.

                              During its 5 most recent tax years before the loss, this corporation must have derived more than 50% of its gross receipts
                              from other than royalties, rents, dividends, interest, annuities, and gains from sales and trades of stocks or securities.
                              If the corporation was in existence for at least 1 year, but less than 5 years, the 50% test applies to the tax years ending
                              before the loss. If the corporation was in existence less than 1 year, the 50% test applies to the entire period the corporation
                              was in existence before the day of the loss. However, if the corporation's deductions (other than the net operating loss and
                              dividends received deductions) were more than its gross income during this period, this 50% test does not apply.

                           If you lend money to a relative or friend with the understanding that it may not be repaid, it is considered a gift and not
                           a loan. You cannot take a bad debt deduction for a gift. There cannot be a bad debt unless there is a true creditor-debtor

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;To deduct a bad debt, you must have a basis in it&#8212;that is, you must have already included the amount in your income
                           or loaned out your cash. For example, you cannot claim a bad debt deduction for court-ordered child support not paid to you
                           by your former spouse. If you are a cash method taxpayer (most individuals are), you generally cannot take a bad debt deduction
                           for unpaid salaries, wages, rents, fees, interest, dividends, and similar items.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;You can take a bad debt deduction only in the year the debt becomes worthless. You do not have to wait until a debt
                           is due to determine whether it is worthless. A debt becomes worthless when there is no longer any chance that the amount owed
                           will be paid.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;It is not necessary to go to court if you can show that a judgment from the court would be uncollectible. You must
                           only show that you have taken reasonable steps to collect the debt. Bankruptcy of your debtor is generally good evidence of
                           the worthlessness of at least a part of an unsecured and unpreferred debt.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;If you guarantee a debt that becomes worthless, you cannot take a bad debt deduction for your payments on the debt
                           unless you can show either that your reason for making the guarantee was to protect your investment or that you entered the
                           guarantee transaction with a profit motive. If you make the guarantee as a favor to friends and do not receive any consideration
                           in return, your payments are considered a gift and you cannot take a deduction.

                              <p>Henry Lloyd, an officer and principal shareholder of the Spruce Corporation, guaranteed payment of a bank loan the corporation
                                 received. The corporation defaulted on the loan and Henry made full payment. Because he guaranteed the loan to protect his

                              <p>On May 6, 2011, you bought 100 shares of Baker Corporation stock for $1,000. On September 7, 2011, you sold short 100 shares
                                 of similar Baker stock for $1,600. You made no other transactions involving Baker stock for the rest of 2011 and the first
                                 30 days of 2012. Your short sale is treated as a constructive sale of an appreciated financial position because a sale of
                                 your Baker stock on the date of the short sale would have resulted in a gain. You recognize a $600 short-term capital gain
                                 from the constructive sale and your new holding period in the Baker stock begins on September 7.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;The wash sale rules apply if you sell common stock at a loss and, at the same time, buy warrants for common stock
                           of the same corporation. But if you sell warrants at a loss and, at the same time, buy common stock in the same corporation,
                           the wash sale rules apply only if the warrants and stock are considered substantially identical, as discussed next.

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;In determining whether stock or securities are substantially identical, you must consider all the facts and circumstances
                           in your particular case. Ordinarily, stocks or securities of one corporation are not considered substantially identical to
                           stocks or securities of another corporation. However, they may be substantially identical in some cases. For example, in a
                           reorganization, the stocks and securities of the predecessor and successor corporations may be substantially identical.
                           <p></p>
                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, bonds or preferred stock of a corporation are not ordinarily considered substantially identical to the
                           common stock of the same corporation. However, where the bonds or preferred stock are convertible into common stock of the
                           same corporation, the relative values, price changes, and other circumstances may make these bonds or preferred stock and
                           the common stock substantially identical. For example, preferred stock is substantially identical to the common stock if the
                           preferred stock:

                           in the same order that you bought them, beginning with the first shares bought. The shares or securities so matched are subject

                              for it is either a long-term or short-term capital gain or loss, depending on how long you held it.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;If the option expires, its cost is either a long-term or short-term capital loss, depending on your holding period,
                              which ends on the expiration date.
                              <p></p>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;If you exercise a call, add its cost to the basis of the stock you bought. If you exercise a put, reduce your amount
                              realized on the sale of the underlying stock by the cost of the put when figuring your gain or loss. Any gain or loss on the
                              sale of the underlying stock is long term or short term depending on your holding period for the underlying stock.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Buying a put option is generally treated as a short sale, and the exercise, sale, or expiration of the put is a closing

                              sale, or expiration of the put is a short-term capital gain. The same is true if you buy the underlying stock after you buy
                              the put but before its exercise, sale, or expiration. Your holding period for the underlying stock begins on the earliest

                              price of one share of XYZ stock on May 12, 2011, was $130.25. The strike prices of all XYZ/September call options offered
                              on May 13, 2011, were as follows: $110, $115, $120, $125, $130, and $135. Because the option has a term of more than 90 days,
                              the LQB is $125, the second highest strike price that is less than $130.25, the applicable stock price. The call option is
                              a deep-in-the-money option because its strike price is lower than the LQB. As a result, the option is not a qualified covered
                              call option, and the loss deferral rules apply if you closed out the option or the stock at a loss during the year.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;You cannot deduct a loss on the disposition of shares of stock or securities that make up the positions of a straddle
                              if, within a period beginning 30 days before the date of that disposition and ending 30 days after that date, you acquired
                              substantially identical stock or securities. Instead, the loss will be carried over to the following tax year, subject to
                              any further application of Rule 1 in that year. This rule will also apply if you entered into a contract or option to acquire

                                 <p>You are not a dealer in stock or securities. On December 1, 2011, you bought stock in XX Corporation (XX stock) and an offsetting
                                    put option. On December 9, 2011, there was $20 of unrealized gain in the put option and you sold the XX stock at a $20 loss.
                                    By December 16, the value of the put option had declined, eliminating all unrealized gain in the position. On December 16,
                                    you bought a second XX stock position that is substantially identical to the XX stock you sold on December 9. At the end of
                                    the year, there is no unrecognized gain in the put option or in the XX stock. Under these circumstances, the $20 loss will
                                    be disallowed for 2011 under Rule 1 because, within a period beginning 30 days before December 9, and ending 30 days after

                                 10. You held both positions through year end, at which time there was $10 of unrecognized gain in the successor long position
                                 and no unrecognized gain in the offsetting short position. Under these circumstances, the entire $10 loss will be disallowed
                                 for 2011 because there is $10 of unrecognized gain in the successor long position.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a disallowed loss that resulted from applying Rule 1 and Rule 2, you must carry it over to the next tax
                              year and apply Rule 1 and Rule 2 to that carryover loss. For example, a loss disallowed in 2010 under Rule 1 will not be allowed
                              in 2011, unless the substantially identical stock or securities (which caused the loss to be disallowed in 2010) were disposed
                              of during 2011. In addition, the carryover loss will not be allowed in 2011 if Rule 1 or Rule 2 disallows it.

                                 <p>The facts are the same as in the example under Rule 1. On December 28, 2012, you sell the second XX stock at a $20 loss and
                                    there is $40 of unrecognized gain in the put option. Under these circumstances, you cannot deduct in 2012 either the $20 loss
                                    disallowed in 2011 or the $20 loss you incurred for the December 28, 2012, sale of XX stock. Rule 1 does not apply because
                                    the substantially identical XX stock was sold during the year and no substantially identical stock or securities were bought
                                    within the 61-day period. However, Rule 2 does apply because there is $40 of unrecognized gain in the put option, an offsetting
                                    position to the loss positions.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;If the sale of a loss position would have resulted in a capital loss, you treat the carryover loss as a capital loss
                              on the date it is allowed, even if you would treat the gain or loss on any successor positions as ordinary income or loss.
                              Likewise, if the sale of a loss position (in the case of section 1256 contracts) would have resulted in a 60% long-term capital
                              loss and a 40% short-term capital loss, you treat the carryover loss under the 60/40 rule, even if you would treat any gain
                              or loss on any successor positions as 100% long-term or short-term capital gain or loss.

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Under this election, you must clearly identify each position that is part of the identified mixed straddle by the
                              earlier of:
                              <div class="itemizedlist">

                              </div>&nbsp;<br>If you dispose of a position in the mixed straddle before the end of the day on which the straddle is established, this identification
                              must be made by the time you dispose of the position. You are presumed to have properly identified a mixed straddle if independent
                              verification is used.
                              <p></p>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The basic tax treatment of gain or loss under this election depends on which side of the straddle produced the total
                              net gain or loss. If the net gain or loss from the straddle is due to the section 1256 contracts, gain or loss is treated
                              as 60% long-term capital gain or loss and 40% short-term capital gain or loss. Enter the net gain or loss in Part I of Form
                              6781 and identify the election by checking box B.
                              <p></p>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;If the net gain or loss is due to the non-section 1256 positions, gain or loss is short-term capital gain or loss.
                              See the Form 6781 instructions for how to report the net gain or loss.
                              <p></p>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;For the specific application of the rules of this election, see Regulations section 1.1092(b)-3T.

                                 <p>On April 1, you entered into a non-section 1256 position and an offsetting section 1256 contract. You also made a valid election
                                    to treat this straddle as an identified mixed straddle. On April 8, you disposed of the non-section 1256 position at a $600
                                    loss and the section 1256 contract at an $800 gain. Under these circumstances, the $600 loss on the non-section 1256 position
                                    will be offset against the $800 gain on the section 1256 contract. The net gain of $200 from the straddle will be treated
                                    as 60% long-term capital gain and 40% short-term capital gain because it is due to the section 1256 contract.
                                 </p>

                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;You may elect to establish one or more accounts for determining gains and losses from all positions in a mixed straddle.
                              You must establish a separate mixed straddle account for each separate designated class of activities.
                              <p></p>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;Generally, you must determine gain or loss for each position in a mixed straddle account as of the close of each business
                              day of the tax year. You offset the net section 1256 contracts against the net non-section 1256 positions to determine the
                              &#8220;<span class="quote">daily account net gain or loss.</span>&#8221;
                                                
                              <p></p>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;If the daily account amount is due to non-section 1256 positions, the amount is treated as short-term capital gain
                              or loss. If the daily account amount is due to section 1256 contracts, the amount is treated as 60% long-term and 40% short-term
                              capital gain or loss.
                              <p></p>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;On the last business day of the tax year, you determine the &#8220;<span class="quote">annual account net gain or loss</span>&#8221; for each account by netting the daily account amounts for that account for the tax year. The &#8220;<span class="quote">total annual account net gain or loss</span>&#8221; is determined by netting the annual account amounts for all mixed straddle accounts that you had established.
                              <p></p>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The net amounts keep their long-term or short-term classification. However, no more than 50% of the total annual account
                              net gain for the tax year can be treated as long-term capital gain. Any remaining gain is treated as short-term capital gain.
                              Also, no more than 40% of the total annual account net loss can be treated as short-term capital loss. Any remaining loss
                              is treated as long-term capital loss.
                              <p></p>
                                    &nbsp;&nbsp;The election to establish one or more mixed straddle accounts for each tax year must be made by the due date (without
                              extensions) of your income tax return for the immediately preceding tax year. If you begin trading in a new class of activities

                              <p>Bob and Gloria sold securities in 2011. The sales resulted in a capital loss of $7,000. They had no other capital transactions.
                                 Their taxable income was $26,000. On their joint 2011 return, they can deduct $3,000. The unused part of the loss, $4,000
                                 ($7,000 &#8722; $3,000), can be carried over to 2012.

                              <p>If their capital loss had been $2,000, their capital loss deduction would have been $2,000. They would have no carryover.</p>

                     <p>Emily Jones is single and, in addition to wages from her job, she has income from stocks and other securities. For the 2011
                        tax year, she had the following capital gains and losses, which she reports on Form 8949 and Schedule D. Her filled-in Form
                        8949 and Schedule D are shown at the end of this example. She keeps track of all her basis adjustments to her mutual funds
                        on her Mutual Fund Record, shown later.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;She shows the nondividend distributions and the undistributed capital gains from Mutual Fund S and the reinvested
                        dividends from Mutual Fund R. She does not show the exempt-interest dividends from Mutual Fund X because those dividends do
                        not change her basis in the shares. She keeps this record with her mutual fund documents and uses it to reconcile her 2011

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Emily sold stock in two different companies that she held for less than a year. In June, she sold 100 shares of Trucking
                        Co. stock that she bought in February. She had an adjusted basis of $1,150 in the stock and sold it for $400. In July, she
                        sold 25 shares of Computer Co. stock that she bought in June. She had an adjusted basis in the stock of $2,000 and sold it
                        for $2,500. She reports these short-term transactions on line 1 in Part I of Form 8949.
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Emily had other stock sales that she reports as long-term transactions on line 3 in Part II of Form 8949.
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;In June, she sold 500 shares of Furniture Co. stock for $5,000. She bought 100 of those shares in 1999, for $1,000.
                        She bought 100 more shares in 2001 for $2,200, and an additional 300 shares in 2004 for $1,500. Her total basis in the stock
                        is $4,700. She reports this transaction on line 3 in Part II of Form 8949.
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;In December, she sold 20 shares of Toy Co. stock for $4,100. This was qualified small business stock that she bought
                        in September 2006. Her basis is $1,100. She enters this information on line 3 in Part II of Form 8949.
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;In October, Emily sold 200 shares of Mutual Fund S for $3,200. She purchased these shares in 1997 at $10 each. She
                        received some nondividend distributions in 1999, 2000, and 2008 that reduced her basis in the shares. In 2009 and 2010, Emily
                        reported undistributed capital gains that increased her basis in her shares. She received no distributions in 2011 before
                        the sale. She reports the sale in Part II on line 3 of her Form 8949. She uses the information from her Form 1099-B to complete
                        columns (a) and (c) through (f). After adjustment for her nondividend distributions and her undistributed capital gains, her
                        basis is $1,996 ($9.98 per share). This is the same basis shown in her personal records and on her Form 1099-B.
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;She received a Form 1099-B (not shown) from her broker for each of these transactions. Each Form 1099-B contains the
                        correct information for the transaction, including the basis shown in box 3. She will check box A in Part I of Form 8949 where
                        she reports her short-term transactions. She will also check box A in Part II of Form 8949 where she reports her long-term
                        transactions. The entries shown in box 2 of these forms total $15,200.
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Emily held her qualified small business stock for more than 5 years, so she can exclude 50% ($1,500) of the gain.
                        She takes the exclusion by reporting the gain realized on the sale on Form 8949, line 3, as if she were not taking the exclusion.
                        She completes all columns on Form 8949. She enters &#8220;<span class="quote">S</span>&#8221; in column (b) and the amount of the excluded gain as a negative number (in parentheses) in column (g). She also enters the
                        exclusion as a positive number on line 2 of the 28% Rate Gain Worksheet.
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Emily completes her Form 8949 and then transfers the amounts from her Form 8949 to Schedule D. She enters the amounts
                        from her short-term transactions from columns (e) and (f) of line 2 of Form 8949, in columns (e) and (f) of line 1 of Schedule
                        D. She has a short-term capital loss of $250 that she enters in column (h) of line 1 of Schedule D. She enters the amounts
                        from her long-term transactions from columns (e), (f), and (g) of line 4 of Form 8949, in columns (e), (f), and (g) of line
                        8 of Schedule D. She has a long-term capital gain of $3,004 that she enters in column (h) of line 8 of Schedule D.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;In June, Emily invested $3,800 in Mutual Fund R and received 153.16 shares that cost $24.81 per share. She requested
                        that all her distributions be reinvested in more shares of the Fund. She then received $265 of ordinary dividends, including
                        $250 of qualified dividends, and $61 of capital gain distributions from the Fund. She received Form 1099-DIV showing these
                        amounts. On December 29, 2011, she acquired an additional 13.03 shares at $25.01 per share from her reinvested dividends.
                        She reports the ordinary dividends on Form 1040, line 9a. She reports the qualified dividends on Form 1040, line 9b. She does
                        not report the ordinary dividends on Schedule B (Form 1040A or Form 1040) because her total ordinary dividends were not over
                        $1,500. She reports the capital gain distributions on Schedule D (Form 1040) because she has other capital transactions. She
                        enters the $61 capital gain distribution on line 13.
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;In April 2009, Emily invested $2,600 in Mutual Fund X and received 87.54 shares at $29.70 per share. She received
                        exempt-interest dividends of $92 in 2009, $107 in 2010, and $101 in 2011. She chose not to reinvest these and instead received
                        a cash payment. She received Form 1099-INT from Fund X showing this nontaxable amount, which she reports on Form 1040, line
                        8b.
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;In 1997, Emily bought 100 shares of common stock in Green Publishing Co. at $10.29 per share. In 2011, she received
                        $237 in ordinary dividends, including $220 of qualified dividends, as a cash payment that was not reinvested. She received
                        Form 1099-DIV showing this amount. She reports the ordinary dividends on Form 1040, line 9a, and the qualified dividends on
                        Form 1040, line 9b.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;On June 2, 2011, Emily had a realized loss from a regulated futures contract of $11,000. She also had an unrealized
                        marked-to-market gain on open contracts of $27,000 at the end of 2011. She reported an unrealized marked-to-market gain of
                        $1,000 on her 2010 tax return. (This $1,000 must be subtracted from her 2011 profit.) These amounts are shown in boxes 10,
                        11, and 12 of the Form 1099-B she received from her broker for these transactions. Box 13 shows her combined profit of $15,000
                        ($27,000 &#8722; $1,000 &#8722; $11,000). She reports this gain in Part I of Form 6781 (not shown). She shows 40% ($6,000) as short-term
                        gain on line 4 of Schedule D and 60% ($9,000) as long-term gain on line 11 of Schedule D.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Emily has a capital loss carryover to 2011 of $800, of which $300 is short-term capital loss, and $500 is long-term
                        capital loss. She enters these amounts on lines 6 and 14 of Schedule D. She also enters the $500 long-term capital loss carryover
                        on line 5 of the 28% Rate Gain Worksheet.
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;She kept the completed Capital Loss Carryover Worksheet in her 2010 edition of Publication 550 (not shown), so she
                        could properly report her loss carryover for the 2011 tax year without refiguring it.

                              &nbsp;&nbsp;Because Emily has gains on both lines 15 and 16 of Schedule D, she checks the &#8220;<span class="quote">Yes</span>&#8221; box on line 17 and goes to line 18. On line 18 she enters $1,000 from line 7 of the 28% Rate Gain Worksheet. Because line
                        18 is greater than zero, she checks the &#8220;<span class="quote">No</span>&#8221; box on line 20 and uses the Schedule D Tax Worksheet to figure her tax.
                        <p></p>
                              &nbsp;&nbsp;After entering the gain from line 16 of Schedule D on line 13 of her Form 1040, she completes the rest of Form 1040
                        through line 43. She enters the amount from that line, $30,000, on line 1 of the Schedule D Tax Worksheet. After filling out
                        the rest of that worksheet, she figures her tax as $2,421. This is less than the tax she would have figured without the capital
                        gain tax rates, $4,079.

                           do not apply to the securities held for investment. You must keep detailed records to distinguish the securities. The securities
                           held for investment must be identified as such in your records on the day you got them (for example, by holding them in a
                           separate brokerage account).

                                 &nbsp;&nbsp;If you made the mark-to-market election, you should report all gains and losses from trading as ordinary gains and
                           losses in Part II of Form 4797, instead of as capital gains and losses on Form 8949 and Schedule D. In that case, securities
                           held at the end of the year in your business as a trader are marked to market by treating them as if they were sold (and reacquired)
                           for fair market value on the last business day of the year. But do not mark to market any securities you held for investment.
                           Report sales from those securities on Form 8949 and Schedule D, as appropriate, not Form 4797. See the 2011 Instructions for

                           and other costs of acquiring or disposing of securities are not deductible but must be used to figure gain or loss. The limit
                           on investment interest expense, which applies to investors, does not apply to interest paid or incurred in a trading business.
