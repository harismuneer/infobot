Sara said she didn't think she and other women pilots should be singled out for attention or that what she was doing was historic. Indeed, little attention has been focused on women fighter pilots and weapons' officers during the war on terrorism, even though it is only the second major U.S. military campaign since the Navy decided to allow women to fly combat aircraft in 1993. Kosovo was the first. "I've never thought that it was a big deal that I was an aviator, I just go out there and do my job," Sara, the 25-year-old from Billings, Mont., said. "I don't like to see women singled out, basically." For security reasons she can only be identified by her first name and her call-sign, "Goalie." Sara, who was surprised by media requests to interview her, said she is proud of the example the United States has set by allowing her to fly combat missions. During the 1991 Gulf War, women sailors flew combat support missions, earning a lot of press coverage and sparking debate about women in combat, especially after a woman helicopter pilot was captured by Iraqi forces. Now women fly the most advanced fighter aircraft, bombing Taliban and al-Qaida targets while under anti-aircraft fire."</font><br><hr><br><center><IMG SRC="images4/com.gif" WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="89" alt="news"><br> <font size=1>At sea aboard USS Theodore Roosevelt, Oct. 17, 2001 - Air Traffic Controllers aboard USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71) work together as a team to safely direct the aircraft assigned to Carrier Air Wing One (CVW 1) as they arrive or depart from the airspace near the ship.
