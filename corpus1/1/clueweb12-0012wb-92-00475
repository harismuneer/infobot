Gains &#8212; or Land Gains?</span></div>
<blockquote>
  <p>Our current way of taxing has some odd puzzles in it.&nbsp; For example, we
    are taxed on our wages, but every 24 months, a couple can sell a highly
    appreciated home they've lived in for the past 24 or more months, and exclude
    from taxation
    the first $500,000 in so-called &quot;capital&quot; gains!&nbsp; Those gains
    are only &quot;capital&quot; gains in a two-factor system of economics: the reality is
    that they are gains on land values.&nbsp; Houses and other buildings, as every
    homeowner knows, depreciate.&nbsp; We spend our &quot;leisure&quot; time &#8212; or
    our money &#8212; in
    an attempt to slow that depreciation: replacing roofs, heating systems, wiring,
    appliances.&nbsp; Houses, being manmade, are, like man, made from dust and
    in the process of returning to dust. </p>
  <p>When wages are insufficient to support one's lifestyle, those who own houses
    in prime locations turn to their home equity, and borrow against it.&nbsp; Those
    without home equity, or in places where home equity rises slowly, do not have
    this cushion available to them.&nbsp; Yet it isn't anything that the lucky
    homeowner has done which produces this cushion for some.&nbsp; In fact, it
    is the presence of people waiting to buy, many of whom are paying rent to a
    landlord, who make his land increasingly valuable.&nbsp; (And those same
    people may be paying sales taxes and income and wage taxes to pay for the
    very services
    that make the local land more valuable!)</p>
  <p>Is there an alternative?&nbsp; Absolutely.&nbsp; Lift the taxes from the
    buildings.&nbsp; Lift
    the taxes from wages.&nbsp; Lift the taxes from sales.&nbsp; Place the taxes
    on the land values.&nbsp; Guess what will happen.&nbsp; The land's value
    will not drop by a cent, but its <em>price</em> will go down, making it affordable
    to those who would put it to good use.&nbsp; (See <a href="Capitalization.html">capitalization</a>, if you need
    more detail on that.) The tax one pays will be a function of the value of the
    site, not the value of the building one places on it.&nbsp; Big site in a choice
    location?&nbsp; Big tax.&nbsp; Tiny lot in an out-of-the-way location?&nbsp; Tiny
    tax.&nbsp; Pay for what you take, but not for what you make.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our
    young people will be able to afford housing in the towns in which they grew
    up.&nbsp; No one will be getting rich as a result of being a landholder.&nbsp; They'll
    have to turn to honest work &#8212; and that work will be available, because
    the land on which to conduct business will be seeking people to put it to
    use,
    instead of telling them to drive further.</p>

<p>Everett Gross: <a href="../docs/Gross_Rent.html">Explaining Rent</a></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes it's difficult for people to understand the meaning of "rent" as
    an economic concept. One way I&nbsp;have of explaining it doesn't use the
    word rent. I just use a little analogy.</p>
  <p>I'm from Crete, Nebraska. It's a small town of 5,000 people.</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Suppose a man comes to Crete, and he wants to start a business. He
      needs a building, but first he needs a piece of ground to build this new
      building on. So he looks up a real estate agent, describes what he wants,
      and the real
      estate agent shows him a parcel that's just right for his needs. The man
      asks the agent, "All right, now how much money do you want for this land?" The agent
      says, "It's worth $50,000." The man says, "Why is it worth $50,000?" And the
      real estate agent points out that "The school is good, the roads are good,
      the police department is good, the rescue crew is good and very fast, and
      business is good here."
    </p>
    <p>So the man says "Yeah, I&nbsp;believe that $50,0000 is a fair price. I'll
        take it. How do I pay the $50,000 to the school people, and the road people,
        and the police department? To whom do I pay the $50,000?" And the real estate
        agent says, "Oh no. You don't pay it to them. You pay it to the person
        who owned the land before."</p>
    <p>The man says, "But who supports the schools, and the roads, and the police,
        and the other good things?" And the real estate agent says, "<i>If</i> you
        build, then you'll pay for them again."</p>
    <p>The buyer then asks, &quot;And what will the previous owner do for me
      for my $50,000?&quot;&nbsp; The real estate man answers, &quot;Nothing!&nbsp; Nothing
    at all!&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Now I&nbsp;don't need to use the word "rent" in that explanation.</p>

  Land: How and why land gets
undervalued</a></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><b>Turning land-value
gains into capital gains</b></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>YOU MAY THINK the largest category
of assets in this countrly is
industrial plant and machinery. In fact <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">the US Federal Reserve
Board's annual balance sheet shows real estate to be the economy's
largest asset, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two-thirds of
America's wealth and more than 60
percent of that in land, depending on the assessment method.</span></span></small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
capital gains are land-value gains. The big players do not
want their profits in rent, which is taxed as ordinary income, but in
capital gains, taxed at a lower rate. </span>To benefit as much as
possible
from today's real estate bubble of fast rising land values they
pledge a property's rent income to pay interest on the debt for as
much property as they can buy with as little of their own money as
possible. After paying off the mortgage lender they sell the property
and get to keep the "capital gain".
</small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">This
price appreciation is actually a "land gain", that is, it's
not from providing start-up capital for new enterprises, but from
sitting on a rising asset already in place, the land. </span>Its value
rises
because neighbourhoods are upgraded, mortgage money is ample, and
rezoning is favorable from farmland on the outskirts of cities to
gentrification of the core to create high-income residential
developments. The potential capital gain can be huge. That's why
developers are willing to pay their mortgage lenders so much of their
rent income, often all of it.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Of course, investing most surplus
income and wealth in land has
been going on ever since antiquity, and also pledging one's land for
debt ("mortgaging the homestead") that often led to its forfeiture to
creditors or to forced sale under distress conditions. <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Today
borrowing against land is a path to getting rich -- before the land
bubble bursts.</span> As economies have grown richer, most of their
surplus
is still being spent acquiring real property, both for prestige and
because its flow of rental income grows as society's prosperity
grows. That's why lenders find real estate to be the collateral of
choice.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Most
new entries into the </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">Forbes</i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> or </span><i style="font-weight: bold;">Fortune</i><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> lists of
the richest men consist of real estate billionaires, or individuals
coming from the fuels and minerals industries or natural monopolies.
</span>Those who have not inherited family fortunes have gained their
wealth
by borrowing money to buy assets that have soared in value. Land may
not be a factor of production, but it enables its owners to assert
claims of ownership and obligation, i.e., rentier income in the forms
of rent and interest.</small>&nbsp; <small><b>&nbsp; </b><span

Michael Hudson and Kris Feder: <a
 href="../docs/Hudson_Feder_RECGD.html">Real Estate and the Capital
Gains Debate</a><br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>
Capital gains taxation has been a divisive issue in Congress at least
since the debates surrounding the Tax Reform Act of 1986, which, aiming
to eliminate tax loopholes and shelters and preferences, repealed
preferentially low tax rates for long-term gains.<span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">1</span> To
bring effective capital gains tax rates back down again was President
Bush&#8217;s &#8220;top priority in tax policy.&#8220;<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">2</span></small> In
1989, Senate Democrats blocked a determined drive to reduce effective
tax rates on the part of Bush, Republican Senators Packwood, Dole and
others, and a few Democratic allies.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">3</span></small> The
administration argued that the tax cuts would stimulate economic growth
and induce asset sales, thereby actually increasing federal tax
revenues; Congressional Democrats countered that the plan benefited
mainly the wealthy, and that tax revenues would in fact decline.<small><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">4</span></small> The
Joint Committee on Taxation projected that budget shortfalls beginning
in 1991 would sum to about $24 billion by 1994 --&nbsp; and that </small><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"><small>most
of the
direct benefits would go to individuals with over $200,000 in taxable
income. House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said that a third of the savings
would be enjoyed by those with gross incomes over one million dollars.</small>&nbsp;&nbsp;

<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">They
err even more egregiously, and tendentiously, in making their
favorite cause the exemption of &#8220;capital gains&#8221; from
taxation. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">I put &#8220;capital
gains&#8221; in quotes because most
capital gains are land value gains</span> (Gaffney, 1990). &#8220;Capital
gains&#8221; is one of those slippery euphemisms that P.R. people came
up with, and the media circulate, to camouflage unearned increments
as functional incentives and rewards for creating capital, and
investing it in income-creating ways.</span> It&#8217;s a way of controlling
us by corrupting the language. A tragedy of modern Georgism is how
easily its Philadelphia convention, during the first Bush
Administration, was stampeded into memorializing Congress to repeal
the capital gains tax. A convention of land speculators could have
done no worse. Most modern Georgists simply did not understand, or
seem to care to understand, how the income tax works. There has been
some progress since then; but still, they need to wake up and smell
the coffee. <a style="font-weight: bold;"

<p>Mason Gaffney: <a href="../docs/Gaffney_PoICG.html">The Partiality of
Indexing Capital Gains</a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>We surely agree with Roberts et
al. that domestic capital
formation is a crying current need; and the means is to foster saving
and investing (but properly defined, as below). We also agree there
is a strong, bi-partisan case for raising investment flows of the
income-creating, work-activating kind. Here, however, we meet the
problem of distinguishing new capital from old assets, especially
land.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Land
is not formed, like capital,
by saving and investment;
land is not reproducible. For that very reason land tends to
appreciate, and therefore has to be a major source of what are
misleadingly called "capital" gains.</span> <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Again for that
very reason,
there is no supply-side kick in untaxing gains. Most of them are land
gains, and should be called that.</span> To use land as a store of
value is
macro-economically unproductive at best, and on balance
counterproductive and destabilizing (considering its effect on
financial institutions like the S&amp;Ls).</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>To handle this matter we need
two semantic distinctions
which often are lost in the word-fencing of debate. Walter Heller,
whose policies still enjoy bi-partisan support, thought and spoke in
a Keynesian framework where "investment" means "investing," an
affirmative, job-making action. It is a process, not a store of
value; an economic flow, not a fund. It is not the asset held: this
"investment" is a noun, macro-economically static and sterile. [<i>Land
may appreciate, and one may call this "investment," but <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">the
appreciation employs no one and creates no new wealth</span> (although
it may
reflect the externalities of wealth created by others).</i>
]</small><br>
<br>
<small>To
signalize these differences I use the present participle "investing,"
rather than the ambiguous noun "investment."&nbsp;<b> </b><i
 style="font-style: italic;">[Webster's 9th New Collegiate defines
investment both ways: it is an action, (the Keynesian usage); it is
also an asset being held, a store of value. Such a two-faced word is a
natural medium for double-talk, and has been so exploited, to the
detriment of general understanding.</i><span style="font-style: italic;">]</span>
<strong>...</strong></small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>As to
borrowing on land, that can be worse than barren when the financial
system rises and falls on a land bubble, as it has and is.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Heller and his contemporaries also
knew that the incentive
driving job-making investing is <span style="font-weight: bold;">MRORAT,
the Marginal Rate of Return
after Taxes. </span><small>[<i>Economists of the 1960s, following
Keynes, called it the MEC, or "Marginal Efficiency of Capital," an
awkward phrase now little used. Awkward or not, and intended or not, it
had great historical consequence by putting the emphasis where it
belongs, on marginal rates of return, excluding rents.</i>]</small></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The marginal idea is pivotal. The
Average ROR includes
rents; the Marginal ROR is the pure return to new investment, Keynes'
"inducement to invest," which is activating and functional.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>These Heller ideas were invoked
again by supply-siders in
early Reagan times. However, policy over the course of the 80s lost
the substance of that policy, keeping only the guise. Domestic
leaders forgot the usage of "investment" in macro-economics. 
</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>They
gradually slipped into an illusion that buying and holding and
bidding up old assets like non-reproduceable lands and stocks would
make jobs and produce goods. They forgot to distinguish old from new
assets, and marginal from average returns on investment (average
returns, recall, include rents). Both critics and supporters of
"supply-side" policies now darken counsel by debating current
policies in supply-side terms, when the terms no longer describe the
policy at issue.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>&nbsp;Along with normal confusion,
there is intelligence behind
such error. The case for downtaxing gains depends in part on
exploiting confusion, in order to pass off rent-raising as an
incentive for saving and investing, and so to disguise its
non-functionality and eminent taxability. The policy is called
"supply side," but isn't. &nbsp;</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The litmus test of the sincerity
of capital-formation champions is
their treatment of irreproduceable land. Raising rents and land
prices, and protecting the gains from taxation, is purely
distributive, with no power to foster saving and investing. On the
contrary, a higher share for rent and/or land purchase must mean a
lower share for the investor in new capital.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Ignoring land and its distinctive
attributes has the effect
of treating land as though it were true, reproduceable capital, to be
formed by saving and investing, to be routinely worn out and replaced
in the normal course of life and business. It lets advocates of
investing and capital formation abuse the legitimate case for macro
incentives, exploiting the case to camouflage unearned, nonfunctional
rents and increments to land value.[<i>Brookings' major contribution to
our subject is Henry Aaron (ed), 1976, Inflation and the Income Tax,
with chapters by 15 eminent economists. Land is treated by none and is
not in the index. [It is mentioned in passing only by one, George Lent.]</i>]</small></p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tantamount
to ignoring land is
minimizing its weight. </span>Thus
one may acknowledge it indulgently, while actually dismissing it. In
fact, though, land comprises some half the assessed value of taxable
real estate in California, and is not dismissable. Half the assessed
value means more than half the market value because of assessment
discrimination favoring land. A raft of studies of assessment
discrimination, like the sales/assessment ratio studies of the U.S.
Census, show consistent patterns of discrimination favoring land. In
addition to ordinary assessment discrimination there is much
legislated underassessment, for land in forest, farm, country club,
and other favored uses. </small></div>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>[An interesting recent case
involves Charles H. Keating, Jr. of
Arizona. He and Kemper Marley posed as farmers to secure "millions of
dollars in agricultural tax breaks on land they planned to develop."
The breaks result from lower assessed land values for "farmers." [<i>Steve
Yozwiak, "Land-tax bill OK reached," The Arizona Republic, 13 April 89.</i>]
<strong>...</strong></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Most states legislate similar
loopholes, widely used by suburban land
speculators. More generally, the effect in California of Prop. 13 is to
keep much land assessed not much above its 1978 valuation.] If that
data were not enough, <span style="font-weight: bold;">most of us
resident in California have been through one or more years since 1976
when the value of our homes alone rose by more than our annual
salaries. ... 
</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Considering the true nature of
most "capital" gains, it is
not surprising that economists have not come forward with claims of
large macro benefits from untaxing gains. The CBO, using a Washington
University Model, recently estimated that excluding 30% of gains from
the income tax base would raise GNP by only "0.1%" - a number well
below the accuracy of any macro model, and effectively zero. James
Poterba last year came up with another figure near zero.&nbsp; ... <a

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>The solution is to make the
regressive taxes pinch landowners. The
income tax, when new, was designed to do exactly that. Georgists like
Congressman Henry George, Jr. and Warren Worth Bailey took the lead
in shaping it to do so. Over time, though, it has changed into mainly
a payroll tax, and as it changed it became increasingly popular with
landowners. It served their greed and became the clarion call of
their constant clamor for "property tax relief."</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small><span style="font-weight: bold;">In
1942 Congress excluded 50 percent of "capital" gains from
taxable income, and broadened the definition of "capital" assets.</span>
As
top-bracket rates on "ordinary" income rose above 50 percent,
Congress capped capital gains rates at 25 percent. Meantime,
wage-taxwithholding was sold as a wartime measure - "We must all do
our duty." <span style="font-weight: bold;">College professors were
dutifully indoctrinating their
students that the income tax is the perfect tax: fair, progressive,
allocationally neutral, all at once.</span></small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Then income tax rates went wild,
going as high as 92 percent on
"ordinary" income (but capped at 25 percent for capital gains).
Federal and state income taxes became the mainstay of public finance.
Owners of income property soon learned to avoid almost all income
taxes by claiming short tax lives by which fictitious inflated
depreciation write-offs offset all their cash flow. Once a property
has exhausted its depreciation "basis," owner A sells the property to
owner B, who depreciates it all over again, and so on through several
rounds. The only "recapture" of this excess depreciation is when A
sells to B for a capital gain; in effect, the rent of income property
shows up as "capital gains." This tax burden is minimized by keeping
rates low on capital gains.</small></p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><small>Many who think of themselves as
"Georgists" have shut their eyes
to this important matter. Some simply declare a pox on all forms of
income tax. Others even join the hue and cry for exempting capital
gains, specifically and preferentially, from income tax. These
positions are, I submit, foolish. <span style="font-weight: bold;">So
long as we have an income tax
that treats land income kindlier and gentler than wage and salary and
interest income, so long will we have perpetual clamor for "property
tax relief" by shifting the burden to incomes, until no burden
remains to shift - a condition we are approaching in half the
states. </span><a href="../docs/Gaffney_PTBaR.html"><span

<br>
<small>&nbsp;The
standard source of data on GNP and its components is the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">National
Income and Product Account (NIPA)</span>, kept and published regularly
by the
U.S. Department of Commerce. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">When
it comes to rent, however, NIPA
depends on the IRS figures, which thus are passed along to all students
of economics as the &#8220;official&#8221; accounting.</span> We have just seen how
far
from reality these data are.</small><br>
<br>
<small>NIPA
is worse, in a way, because <span style="text-decoration: underline;">NIPA
explicitly excludes &#8220;capital gains&#8221;
from National Income.</span> That is, first the IRS converts rents into
capital gains, and then NIPA banishes capital gains from GNP, National
Income, and National Product. &#8220;Capital gains&#8221; is an artificial term,
that includes all gains realized from the sale of what Congress defines
at any time as &#8220;capital assets.&#8221; &#8220;Capital assets&#8221; include land and
improvements, housing, common stock, growing timber, breeding herds
(including race and show and riding horses), mineral and hydrocarbon
reserves in the ground, and several other favorite holdings of the rich
and well-connected. As we saw in &#8220;b&#8221;, most commercial rents show up as
capital gains, so that NIPA does not report them at all. Then along
come highly visible economists like Paul Samuelson, Robert Solow,
Theodore Schultz, Edwin Mills, Jan Pen, and others to look up this
datum, and declare that land rents are no more than 5% of national
income, and cannot possibly support modern governments. This is
unfortunate, and quite misleading.</small><br>
<br>
<small>&nbsp; NIPA
is better by virtue of its making a gesture at including the imputed
value of owner-occupied housing. Whether they do it right is a question
on my agenda. <a href="../docs/Gaffney_StRPOL15LE.html">Read the whole

Nic Tideman: <a href="docs/Tideman_LTaELS.html">Land Taxation and Efficient
    Land Speculation</a><blockquote>
  <p><b>Taxes on
    Realized Gains from the Sale of Land</b></p>
  <p>A tax on realized gains from the sale of land shares with a tax on realized
    income from land the characteristics of imposing no explicit cost on holding
    land idle and falling on entrepreneurship as well as land. It has the additional
    unfortunate feature of being avoidable by continuation of ownership. If there
    were no improvements in the efficiency of land use that depended on transferring
    land title, a tax on gains from the sale of land would have no distorting effects
    and would also raise no revenue. To avoid the tax, people would simply lease
    land rather than sell it, and no tax would be collected. The general principle
    involved here is that if a tax is levied on a good for which there is an untaxed
    perfect substitute, everyone will use the substitute, there will be no welfare
    losses, and there will be no tax revenue.</p>
  <p>Another set of conditions under which a tax on realized gains from the sale
    of land would have no distorting effects is if landholders were able to obtain
    a return from land only by selling it, and if there were no entrepreneurship
    involved in obtaining the best possible sale price. A person indifferent between
    two options involving different timing of development would be indifferent
    between the two when what was received was a constant fraction of the returns
    from the two. However, because it is possible to obtain a return from land
    not only by selling it but also by using it oneself, and because entrepreneurship
    is involved in the sale of land, a tax on gains from the sale of land will
    have the effect of reducing sales and therefore, typically, postponing development.
    It is also possible that the prospect of paying the tax would induce a landholder
    to undertake a modest, premature development under on his or her own, when
    in the absence of the tax the landholder would wait and sell the land to specialists
    in development. Whether the development is advanced or postponed, however,
    the effect of the tax is to reduce the efficiency of development.</p>
  <p style="font-weight: bold;">In the U.S., a further consideration that causes
    development to be postponed is the possibility of avoiding Federal income
    taxes on increases in land value by including the land in one's estate. Estate
    taxes
    are paid according to the actual value of the land (as they would be paid
    on the proceeds if the land were sold), but one's heirs pay taxes only on
    the
    increase in value after it leaves the estate, so that taxes on the increase
    in value during one's lifetime can be avoided. ... <a href="docs/Tideman_LTaELS.html">read
