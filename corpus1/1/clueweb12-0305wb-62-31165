          up and sea trials, USS Carl Vinson with a crew of almost 6,000 Sailors 
          departed Norfolk, Va., on <strong>March 1, 1983</strong>, and embarked on an eight-month 
          around the world cruise. CVN 70 steamed in the waters of the Caribbean 
          Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, 
          South China Sea, Sea of Japan and the Pacific Ocean en route to its new 
          homeport of Naval Air Station Alameda, Calif. On <strong>October 28, 1983</strong>, she sailed under the Golden Gate Bridge for the first time as

            the highest marks ever awarded an aircraft carrier during an operational 
            readiness examination in February. In March, the ship and crew became &quot;San Francisco's Own&quot; in a formal adoption ceremony. In May, 
            the Vinson participated in RIMPAC '84, a multi-national exercise involving 
            ships from nations which &quot;Rim of the Pacific&quot; including Canada, 
            Japan, Australia, as well as the United Kingdom. On Oct. 14, it

            Commendations for operations conducted from November 1984 to May 1985. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In May and June 1986, the 
            Nimitz-class aircraft carrier was involved in a series of high-tempo operations that included 
            RIMPAC '86 exercise. On <strong>Aug. 12</strong>, Carl Vinson deployed on its second 
            western Pacific/Indian Ocean cruise and it's third deployment in all. 
            During transit west, she became the first aircraft to operate 
            in the Bering Sea. </font></p>

            Alameda for its fourth deployment on <strong>June 15, 1988</strong>, and making another challenging and successful transit of the Bering 
            Sea. The carrier completed 82 days on station in the North Arabian Sea. 
            While on station, the &quot;Gold Eagle&quot; supported the escorting of American 
            flagged tankers in the Arabian Gulf. It returned to 
            homeport on <strong>December 16</strong>. The ship received its second Admiral Flatley Memorial 
            Award for aviation safety. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">She departed Alameda 
            on  September 18, 1989, to participate in PACEX '89, the largest peacetime 
            naval exercise since World War II. USS Carl Vinson conducted operations 
            in the icy waters of the Bering Sea, including operations inside the 
            Aleutian Islands. In the following weeks, the &quot;Gold Eagle&quot;, leading a battle 
            force of three carrier battle groups, conducted operations in the western 
            Pacific Ocean and Sea of Japan, and were joined by the navies of other 
            nations. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">USS Carl Vinson  departed on its 
            fifth deployment on <strong> February 1, 1990</strong>, for the western 
            Pacific and Indian Ocean. After returning to Alameda on<strong> July 3</strong>, the 
            carrier steamed to Bremerton, Wash., in September to commence a complex 
            overhaul at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard starting on Sept. 22, which would 
            conclude on April 6, 1993. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The &quot;Gold Eagle&quot; started its sixth 
            deployment on <strong> February 17, 1994</strong>, to the western Pacific

            Pacific Fleet change of command was held on the carrier on Aug. 5 while 
            at Pearl Harbor. CVN 70 returned to Alameda on <strong>Aug. 17</strong>, and received 
            its third Admiral Flatley Award for aviation safety.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">From August 26 to  September 
            3, 1995, USS Carl Vinson participated in Exercise Ke Koa and the commemoration 
            of the end of World War II in the Pacific. During the commemoration, 
            President Bill Clinton visited the ship in Hawaii and 12 historic warplanes 
            from World War II were launched from the flight deck. One month later, 
            the ship returned to the San Francisco Bay area and participated in 
            Fleet Week, '95, launching World War II aircraft, an F/A-18 Hornet and 
            F-14 Tomcat, and an unprecedented launch and recovery of an S-3 Viking 
            in San Francisco Bay. It received its second Meritorious Unit

Scott Lamoreaux, the former CO of VF-2, conducted a simulated anti-ship-attack. During this maneuver he flew an F-14D of VF-11 and in one of the plane's two engines there suddenly was an engine blaze. Guided by his wingman &quot;106&quot;, he was ordered back to the carrier. He drained off some fuel to reach the landing weight but near the carrier's starboard his F-14D detonated and he was killed.<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&nbsp; </font></font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CVN 70 </font><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> departed <strong> May 14</strong>,  for its seventh deployment to the western Pacific 
            and Arabian Gulf. The Vinson participated in Exercise Rugged Nautilus 
            and Operations Desert Strike and Southern Watch before returning to 
            Alameda <strong>Nov. 14</strong>. The &quot;Gold Eagle&quot; received its second Battle &quot;E,&quot; 
            its third Meritorious Unit Commendations and its fourth Admiral Flatley 
            Award.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On <strong>January 17, 1997</strong>, USS Carl Vinson arrived at its new homeport of Bremerton, Washington. In February, the ship added another chapter in the history of naval aviation as the platform for the last carrier launches and recoveries of the A6-E intruder.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Following an intense 1998 
            work up period the Carl Vinson participated in RIMPAC '98. It steamed 
            from Bremerton in early <strong>November 1998</strong> for its eighth deployment to the western Pacific and Arabian Gulf. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When the deployment began, 
            CVN 70 Battle Group was scheduled to make port visits in Australia 
            before proceeding to the Gulf in support of Operation Southern Watch. 
            However, because of increased tensions in the Gulf region, the ship 
            took a more direct route there, permitting port visits to Hong Kong 
            and Singapore. Shortly after departing Singapore, she was ordered 
            to make best speed to the Arabian Gulf, more than 2,000 miles away, 
            proceeded directly to their designated operating area and immediately 
            launched a combat strike on the fourth and final day of Operation Desert 
            Fox. On <strong>December 19, 1998</strong>, the Battle Group surface ships USS 
            Princeton (CG 54) and USS Fitzgerald (DDG 62) simultaneously launched 
            cruise missiles, while Carrier Air Wing 11 aircraft struck a half-dozen 
            sites in southern Iraq using precision-guided munitions in the closing 
            wave of attacks in Operation Desert Fox. Following DF, the  Battle Group settled into a combat routine supporting Operation 
            Southern Watch, enforcing the Southern No-Fly Zone in Iraq and conducting 
            Maritime Interception Operations. These operations included monitoring 
            and boarding shipping entering and departing Iraq. In 1999 USS Carl Vinson 
            maintained pressure on Iraq by launching several air strikes against 
            selected targets located in the no-fly zone of southern Iraq in support 
            of Operation Southern Watch from January to March. During this deployment, Carrier Air Wing Eleven completed 8698 sorties and 17,398.3 
            flight hours with a 94.7 percent completion rate.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In July 1999 USS Carl Vinson entered 
            Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for an 11-month Drydocked Planned Incremental 
            Availability (DPIA). The Navy spent more than $230 million for equipment 
            upgrades, a new local-area network (LAN), new berthings, and several 
            quality-of-life upgrades.</font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">USS Carl Vinson finished the 
            overhaul period in June 2000 and began the pre-deployment phase of operations. 
            The aircraft carrier got underway for sea trials, TSTA, FEP, and COMPTUEX in the 
            fall, operating off the coast of southern California with Carrier Air 
            Wing 11 and other ships in the battlegroup. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Vinson was again underway on February 6, 2001 in the Pacific Ocean following a five-day port visit to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Prior to visiting Hawaii, the carrier and its air wing conducted sustainment training and visited San Diego following departure from its homeport  on January 13th. CVN 70 has completed required predeployment training and is fully qualified to respond to any mission. The Carl Vinson BG has not received deployment orders at this time. The Battle Group continues to train and perform duties as it normally would and is prepared for any mission it may be directed to conduct. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On March 7, 2001 USS Carl Vinson completed a major hurdle when it wrapped up a grueling four-day at-sea off-loading more than 1,875 tons of ammunition. Ammunition UNREPs occur about six months prior to every aircraft carrier's western Pacific deployment. The ammunition is off-loaded from a carrier returning from underway period. Carl Vinson's mission load came from the Everett-based USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN 72), which returned from deployment in February. CVN 70  is scheduled 
            to depart  in late July 2001. The &quot;Gold Eagle&quot; returned to homeport after a six-month deployment on <strong>January 19, 2002</strong>. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On September 6, the Vinson finished it's yard period. During the ship's five-month stay at PSNS several new operational systems were installed, and the ship's flight deck and catapults were completely renovated. Numerous other spaces and crew living areas were also entirely restored, drastically improving the working and living conditions for the crew. One of the biggest jobs performed during the Vinson's yard stay was the installation of the Smart Carrier System, which makes use of automated technology to monitor the carrier's damage control, jet fuel and list control systems. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">September 9, CVN 70 returned  to   Naval Station Bremerton from almost 
            a week of fast-paced testing and training at sea. Carl Vinson's successful 
            completion of these Sea Trials signaled the ships anticipated return 
            to the operational fleet. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In late September through 
            October the aircraft carrier completed her flight deck qualifications and 
            is believed to have taken part in some aspects of TSTA. On October 24, 
            she departed Bremerton for what is believed to be COMPTUEX. This 
            is a remarkable development as she was previously believed 
            to be trailing the USS Nimitz in the IDTC. The ship is due to return to Bremerton 
            just before Thanksgiving. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">CVN 70  began its 
            COMPTUEX in early November 2002 and completed them by the end of the 
            month. It was scheduled to begin its JTFEX by mid-January 
            completing them some two weeks later. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>February 4</strong>, 
            USS Carl Vinson and elements of her Battle Group were ordered to deploy 
            to the western Pacific to act as a deterrent to North Korea following 
            an increase in tensions between the US and the DPRK. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On  February 
            25th the aircraft carrier arrived in Guam for a port of call where it stayed for 
            an undetermined amount of time. In early March the U.S. Navy announced that 
            it would head North making a port of call at Busan and would 
            later take part in RSOI/FE 2003. This port visit was the first time 
            in four years that a carrier made a port visit to the Republic of korea during the 
            exercise. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In April the Vinson headed south 
            and participated in exercise Tandem Thrust 2003, and made a port call 
            at Guam on April 17, departing the island on April 21. From Guam 
            it headed north and arrived at Yokosuka on May 15, 
            where it remained until May 17, at which point it again headed for Guam. 
            On May 19,  she pulled into Guam for extensive maintenance 
            and the reparing of the flight deck. The ship remained in Guam until 
            June 1. After conducting operations in the Pacific for roughly 3 weeks 
            the &quot;Gold Eagle&quot; pulled to Singapore on June 26 where it remained until 
            July 1. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On July 14  the Nimitz-class aircraft carrier arrived in Fremantle, Australia, for a three-day port call and from there conducted operations in the Indian Ocean 
            until July 30 when it entered the Banda Sea. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On August 1 USS Carl Vinson 
            was operating in the Celebes Sea and on  4th the ship was operating 
            in the South China Sea as it headed for a port call in Hong Kong on 
            Aug. 6. It  departed  on  11th and began operating 
            in the Sea of Japan/East Sea. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">On August 27 the Carl Vinson was 
            scheduled to make a port call at Busan but as this date coincided with 
            the beginning of 6-party talks in Beijing between the US and North Korea 
            the port visit was delayed until August 29. Sometime around  29th, 
            the carrier received orders to return to Bremerton by Sept. 
            19 ending its extended deployment some two months earlier than originally 
            planned. Information from the Navy was lacking, though sources and various 
            news reports indicate that the decision was made by Secretary of Defense 
            Donald Rumsfeld. The Vinson Strike Group was to be replaced by the Nimitz 
            CSG as the  Kitty Hawk had run into difficulties which would 
            delay the availablity of the ship in the event of a crisis. The &quot;Gold Eagle&quot; departed Busan on September 1.  On Sept. 
            15, CVN 70 pulled to Naval Air 
            Station North Island to offload the remaining air wing personnel 
            and equipment. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>September 19</strong>, USS Carl Vinson returned home after more than seven-month underway period. During the deployment, which covered 60,000 nautical miles, equivalent to two trips around the world, the aircraft from CVW-9 flew more than 10,000 sorties, offered indirect strike-planning support for Operation Iraqi Freedom, and participated in several international naval exercises, including Foal Eagle, Tandem Thrust and Ulchi Focus Lens. </font></p>
          <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In January 2004 the Vinson  conducted
