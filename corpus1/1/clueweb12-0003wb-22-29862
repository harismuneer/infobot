<p>@SONG: Dreamlover
@LYRICS/MUSIC: M Carey, D Hall

</p><p>I need a lover to give me
The kind of love that'll last always
I need somebody uplifting
To take me away, babe
Oh yeah, yeah

</p><p>I want a lover who knows me, yeah
Who understands how I feel inside
Someone to comfort and hold me
Through the long lonely nights
Till the dawn
Why don't you take me away

</p><p>Dreamlover, come rescue me
Take me up, take me down
Take me anywhere you want to, baby, now
I need you so desperately
Won't you please come around
'Cause I wanna share forever with you, baby
With you, baby

</p><p>I don't want another pretender, no
To disillusion me one more time
Whispering words of forever
Playing with my mind
No, no
No, no, no, no, no, baby

</p><p>I need someone to hold on to
The kind of love that won't fly away
I just wan't someone to belong to
Every day of my life
Always
So come and take me away

</p><p>Dreamlover, come rescue me
Take me up, take me down
Take me anywhere you want to, baby, now
I need you so desperately
Won't you please come around
'Cause I wanna share forever with you, baby
Baby, you

</p><p>(Do do do do do do do)
(Do do do do do do do)
(Do do do do do do do)
Baby come and take me away

</p><p>Dreamlover, come rescue me
Take me up, take me down
Take me anywhere you want to, baby, now
I need you so desperately
Won't you please come around
'Cause I wanna share forever with you, baby
(Do do do do do do do)

</p><p>Dreamlover, come rescue me
Take me up, take me down
Take me anywhere you want to, baby, now
I need you so desperately
Won't you please come around
'Cause I wanna share forever with you, baby

<p>@SONG: Hero
@LYRICS/MUSIC: M Carey, W Afanasieff

</p><p>There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know will melt away

</p><p>And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

</p><p>It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No-one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt will disappear

</p><p>And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

</p><p>Lord knows, dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time, you'll find the way

</p><p>And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you

<p>@SONG: Anytime You Need a Friend

And need a friend
And troubles seem like they never end
Just remember to keep the faith
And love will be there to light the way

</p><p>Anytime you need a friend

<p>@SONG: Music Box
@LYRICS/MUSIC: M Carey, W Afanasieff

</p><p>When I am lost
You shine a light for me
And set me free
When I am low
You wash away my tears
And take me through

</p><p>The loneliness
And emptiness
Through the darkest night
Somehow, I survive through it all

</p><p>When you tell me I'm the only one you need
Sweet and tenderly
And your love breaks away the clouds surrounding me
All I have I want to give to thee
Oh baby
Mmm

</p><p>If I should fall
Your love is strong enough to lift me up
If I'm afraid
Oh baby
You chase away my fears 
And take me to a brighter place
Beyond the rain
And I feel alright
Because you're by my side through it all

</p><p>And you tell me I'm the only one you need
Sweet and tenderly
And your love breaks away the clouds surrounding me
All I have I want to give to thee

</p><p>You take me through
The loneliness and the emptiness
And I feel alright
'Cause you're by my side
Through it all
You tell me I'm the only one you need
So sweet and tenderly
And your love just breaks away the clouds surrounding me
And baby, all I have I want to give to thee

</p><p>Want to give you all of my love
Now and forever my love
All I have I want to give to thee
Mmm

</p><hr/>

<p>@SONG: Now That I Know
@ARTIST: M Carey, D Cole, R Clivilles

</p><p>Now that I know
That you want me for me
I can be what you want
I can be what you need
Now that I know
That your love is for real
I can finally see
This is not make believe anymore

</p><p>I never knew
If I could believe in you
I thought I was just a diversion
And you were killing some time
My friends, they told me to leave you
They said you would never ever ever be mine
But you gave me your love
And you said I'm the one you want
For the rest of your life

</p><p>Now that I know
That you want me for me
I can be what you want
I can be what you need
Now that I know
That your love is for real
I can finally see
This is not make believe anymore

</p><p>I was afraid
That it was all a masquerade
That I was only a plaything
And you would leave me behind
But now I feel so secure
By your side
I can conquer the world
'Cause I gave you my love
And I know you're the one
I want for the rest of my life

</p><p>Now that I know
That you want me for me
I can be what you want
I can be what you need
Now that I know
That your love is for real
I can finally see
This is not make believe anymore

</p><p>Now that I know
That you want me for me
I can be what you want
I can be what you need
Now that I know
That your love is for real
I can finally see
This is not make believe anymore

</p><p>(I really feel it)
So much love
(I really feel it)
So much joy
(I really feel it)
Sweet sweet ecstasy
(I feel it)
'Cause you opened my eyes
And I realize
Your love is real
Its for real

</p><p>Now that I know
That you want me for me
I can be what you want
I can be what you need
Now that I know
That your love is for real
I can finally see
This is not make believe anymore

</p><p>Now that I know
That you want me for me
I can be what you want
I can be what you need
Now that I know
That your love is for real
I can finally see
This is not make believe anymore

<p>@SONG: Never Forget You
@LYRICS/MUSIC: M Carey, K Edmonds

</p><p>I won't see your smile
And I won't hear you laugh anymore
Every night
I won't see you walk through that door

</p><p>'Cause time wasn't on your side
It isn't right
I can't say I love you
It's too late to tell you
But I really need you to know
Oh baby

</p><p>No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold onto the memories, baby

</p><p>Baby, can you hear me
Wherever you may be tonight
Are you near me
I need you to be by my side

</p><p>'Cause I never said goodbye
It isn't right
I should have said I love you
Why didn't I just tell you
God knows, I need you to know
Oh baby

</p><p>No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold onto the memories, baby

</p><p>Somewhere, I know you'll be with me
Someday in another time
But right now, you're gone
You just vanished away
But I'll never leave you behind

</p><p>No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold onto the memories, baby

</p><p>No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold onto the memories, baby

</p><hr/>

<p>@SONG: Without You
@LYRICS/MUSIC: WP Ham, T Evans

</p><p>No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes it shows

</p><p>No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there
But then I let you go
And now it's only fair
That I should let you know
What you should know now

</p><p>I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore

</p><p>Well, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes your sorrow shows
Yes it shows

</p><p>I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore

</p><p>I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live

</p><hr/>

<p>@SONG: Just to Hold You Once Again
@LYRICS/MUSIC: M Carey, W Afanasieff

</p><p>Do you know how it feels
Lying here without you, baby
You could never understand
What's happening to me
So alone
Nothing's real
I just dream about you baby
And forever wonder why you had to break free

</p><p>Even though you're not my lover
Even though you're not my friend
Oh baby
I would give my all
To have you here
Just to hold you once again

</p><p>It's so hard to believe
I don't have you right beside me
As I long to touch you
But you're out of my reach
And my heart doesn't feel
It's so very cold inside me
Just a shadow of someone that I used to be

</p><p>Even though you're not my lover, baby
Even though you're not my friend
No no no
I would give my all
To have you here
Just to hold you once again

</p><p>You were the only one (only one)
That I allowed inside my heart
Now I'm just holding on
To something so far gone
Oh where did I go wrong

</p><p>Even though you're not my lover, baby
And even though you're not my friend
No no no no
I would give my all
To have you here
Just to hold you once again
Just to hold you once again
Mmm

</p><hr/>

<p>@SONG: I've Been Thinking About You
@LYRICS/MUSIC: M Carey, D Cole, R Clivilles

</p><p>We've known each other
For a long, long time
But I never really noticed
All the magic in your eyes
I've been around you
A thousand times before
And you've always been a friend to me
But now I'm wanting more

</p><p>I must have been so blind
I never realized
You're the one that's right for me
All the while I couldn't see
And now I feel so strange
I'll never be the same
Going 'round and 'round in circles
And I don't know what to do

</p><p>'Cause baby
I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar way
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think I'm falling in love
With you

</p><p>There's no explaining how I feel inside
I'm going through a transformation
That's so hard for me to hide
I had a revelation that finally opened up my eyes
The one I spent a lifetime searching for
Was right here all the time

</p><p>I was oblivious
So very out of touch
All the while I couldn't see
You're the one that's right for me
And now my world has changed
I'll never be the same
Going 'round and 'round in circles
And it's all because of you
Sweet baby

</p><p>I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar way
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think I'm falling in love
With you

</p><p>I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar way
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think
I'm falling in love
With you

</p><p>Don't you know
That you're blowing my mind
What you do to me
I can't describe
Baby, I can't hold back anymore
I just can't conceal it
You're the one I really adore

</p><p>I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar way
I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar way

</p><hr/>

<p>@SONG: All I've Ever Wanted
@LYRICS/MUSIC: M Carey, W Afanasieff

</p><p>If you only knew what I feel for you
If you only lived for me
The way I live for you
I'd be in heaven
My dreams would come true

</p><p>'Cause all I've ever wanted is you
And you alone
And I love you so
More than you could ever know
All I've ever wanted is you

</p><p>If you were my own
To caress and hug
I would shower you with love
And drown within your soul
'Cause I live and breath for you
And I really need you to know

</p><p>That all I've ever wanted is you
And you alone
And I love you so
More than you could ever know
All I've ever wanted is you

</p><p>Everything I do is for you
And you are every part of me
And I don't want to face another day alone
Without your love

</p><p>'Cause all I've ever wanted is you
And you alone
And I love you so
More than you could ever know
All I've ever wanted is you
All I've ever wanted is you
Is you
You

</p><hr/>

<p>@SONG: Everything Fades Away
@LYRICS/MUSIC: M Carey, W Afanasieff

</p><p>Baby, don't tell me you missed me
You loved me
Don't whisper gently that you can't forget me
Tonight, tonight
'Cause I've heard it all before
Just turn away
Don't play that game
Baby, I don't want to anymore

</p><p>Let it all fade away
Don't you know the love is gone
It's too late
Everything fades away
Nothing ever stays the same
Baby, no, no, no

</p><p>Don't tell me you're sorry you hurt me
How many times can I give in
How many battles can you win
Oh, don't beg for mercy
Tonight, tonight
'Cause I can't take anymore
Just turn around
Don't break me down
Baby, I don't love you like before

</p><p>Let it all fade away
Don't you know the love is gone
It's too late
Everything fades away
Nothing ever stays the same
Baby, oh

</p><p>(So hard for me to let you go)
(Don't leave me standing in the cold)
(Oh, baby, give it one more chance)
(I know that we can make it last)
(Just let me love you one more time)
Don't say it
('Cause I don't wanna lose my mind)
Don't say it, baby
(It's so hard for me to let you go)
(So hard for me to let you go)

</p><p>Let it all fade away
The love is gone, baby
It's too late
Everything fades away
Nothing ever stays the same, babe
Nothing ever stays the same

</p><p>Let it all fade away
The love is gone, baby
It's too late
Everything fades away
(Stays the same, baby)

</p><p>(It only fades, it only fades)
(Only fades, it only fades)

</p><p>Baby don't tell me you miss me
(It only fades, it only fades)
You love me
(Only fades, it only fades)

</p><p>Baby don't tell me you miss me
(It only fades, it only fades)
You love me
(Only fades, it only fades)

</p><p>Baby don't tell me you miss me
(It only fades, it only fades)
You love me
(Only fades, it only fades)

</p><p>Baby don't tell me you miss me
