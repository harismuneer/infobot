    <div class="post-body">

      <p align="left" class="VNOGfontlarge"><a href="MakingAlienSong.htm">&lt; Back to Page 1</a></p>
      <p align="left" class="VNOGfontlarge">My first animation 
        with the as yet unnamed Blit (and my second ever, the first being a mediocre
        walk cycle of a duck) was appropriately called &quot;<a href="http://www.s1.hashmirror.com/ftp/pub/movies/alientest.mov" target="_blank">Alien 
          Test</a>&quot;. This was primarily an exercise in acting and timing, and also
        in working with the software and distilling a good skeletal constraint
        setup. I wanted to see if I could put the scene that I saw in my head
        into the computer. In this piece, as in the 2 subsequent pieces, the
        set
        is minimal in order to focus on the animation. I finished it in late
        July of that year, and I believe it was a moderately successful piece,
        though
        I could certainly do it better and faster today. </p>
      <p class="VNOGfontsmall">Next I decided to 
        take what I had learned on &quot;Alien Test&quot; and try something more ambitious.
        I spent some time reworking the constraints and the model, and I built
        a gun for him to use as a prop. My intent for this piece was to give
        the
        character and the gun a sense of weight, and the style of motion and
        camera work was influenced by martial arts films and Japanese animation.
        Thus
        was born &quot;<a href="http://www.s1.hashmirror.com/ftp/pub/movies/aliengun.mov" target="_blank">Alien Gun</a>&quot;,
        which I completed in late November of 1998. I'm pretty satisfied with
        the end
        result, though in retrospect I would tailor the walk more to the point
        of view of the camera. </p>
      <p class="VNOGfontsmall">After more constraint 
        revisions and the addition of a shirt, Blit was ready to move on. I figured
        it was about time I tackled lip-synch so I began to look for interesting
        audio sources. I didn't want to use my own voice because I don't like
        the way my voice sounds in recordings, and I don't think that Blit
        would
        sound like me anyway. I was considering a William Shatner bit or quotes
        from some of my favorite movies when, at my wife's office Christmas
        party,
        the DJ put on Gloria Gaynor's &quot;I Will Survive&quot;. I was immediately struck 
        with the image of Blit emoting on a stool under a blue spotlight. I'm 
        not a big fan of disco, but I thought the song had some interesting emotional 
        transitions and a narrative that would lend itself well to animation. 
        The combination of Blit and &quot;I Will Survive&quot; is incidental. Blit was the 
        only character I had setup and ready to animate, and I thought the song 
        was good for lip-synching in its own right. The line in the song about 
        &quot;outer space&quot; was just a lucky coincidence. There's really no other justification 
        as to why a dorky green alien is singing like a black diva, but I think 
        this absurdity is somehow working in favor of the animation. My only concern 
        is that people might think that Blit's personality is that of a diva, 
        when in actuality I think of him more as he appeared in &quot;Alien Test&quot;:
        goofy and vulnerable.</p>
      <p class="VNOGfontsmall"> I started production 
        on &quot;Alien Song&quot; by creating a dozen or so mouth shapes for Blit so that
        he could enunciate the words. I located a copy of the song on a disco
        compilation CD and digitized it. A musician friend of mine, <a href="http://www.dramaticaudio.com/" target="_blank">Jamey 
          Scott</a>, edited the song down to just the lyrics I wanted and adjusted 
        the tempo to make it an even 120 beats per minute (this made figuring 
        out the timing for 24 frames per second a snap). I imported the audio 
        and bitmap renderings of the mouth shapes into <a href="http://www.thirdwishsoftware.com/magpiepro.html" target="_blank">Magpie 
          Pro</a>, a great little stand-alone ap for figuring out lip-synch and
        making dope sheets. After lots of scrubbing and pushing images around
        between frames I had the basic lip-synch worked out, and I transferred
        that information into A:M. Note: the current version of Animation Master
        now has similar lip-synch features built in. Once in A:M I was able to
        fine tune the lip-synch more and add areas of emphasis. Of course I would
        not be satisfied with Blit simply reciting the lyrics; I had to make
        a
        big production of it! Inspired by 70's variety and music shows like &quot;Solid 
        Gold&quot; I choreographed a hokey stage number complete with colored lights, 
        camera dolly and a dance floor right out of &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;. </p>
      <p class="VNOGfontsmall">I sketched out thumbnails 
        of ideas for &quot;story&quot; poses that would emphasize the key phrases
        in the lyrics in the song.</p>
      <p align="center" class="VNOGfontsmall"><a href="../Media/Resources/MakingAlienSong/Figure09.JPG"><img src="../Media/Resources/MakingAlienSong/Figure09.JPG" alt="" width="320" height="240" /></a></p>
      <p class="VNOGfontsmall"> Compare these with some of the final poses from the animation.</p>
      <p align="center" class="VNOGfontsmall"><a href="../Media/Resources/MakingAlienSong/Figure10.JPG"><img src="../Media/Resources/MakingAlienSong/Figure10.JPG" alt="" width="320" height="240" /></a></p>
      <p class="VNOGfontsmall">From there I would go in and create more poses in-between, as
        well as establish anticipation and follow-through. Occasionally I would
        animate custom constraints, such as a &quot;Translate To&quot; on the Hand Control
        Bone, so that I could dynamically attach his hands to his chest or hips
        without them slipping as his torso twists. </p>
      <p class="VNOGfontsmall">While working on the 
        seated portion of the animation I was also creating a looping <a href="../Media/Movies/Walktest.mov">&quot;strut&quot; cycle</a> that
        would form the foundation for the second half of the sequence. This cycle
        included animation for all parts of his body
        except for the arms, which were custom animated throughout. With the
        strut cycle in place in the Choreography I was able to animate additional
        motion
        on top, as needed. A:M's ability to layer animations or &quot;Actions&quot; onto
        a character was key in the execution of this piece. </p>
      <p class="VNOGfontsmall">The trickiest part 
        of the sequence was probably the transition from sitting to standing.
        I never really got the weight shift or foot placement right, but I
        was
        able to hide this with a little creative framing and camera switching.
        Another &quot;cheat&quot; occurs when Blit points at the camera on &quot;weren't 
        you the one...&quot;. I couldn't get his hand close enough to the camera 
        to get the result I wanted, so for that gesture I scaled his hand up by 
        20% to make it appear more &quot;in your face&quot;.</p>
      <p align="center" class="VNOGfontsmall"><a href="../Media/Resources/MakingAlienSong/Figure12.JPG"><img src="../Media/Resources/MakingAlienSong/Figure12.JPG" alt="" width="320" height="240" /></a></p>
      <p class="VNOGfontsmall">This animation was 
        created both on the Mac and PC, and the final frames were rendered at 
        D1 resolution (720 x 486 with pixel ratio of .9) and sampled down for 
        the web version. I also did plenty of post-processing in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.adobe.com/products/aftereffects/main.html">Adobe 
          After Effects</a> as I always will, given the chance. I softened the images, added some 
        bloom and film grain, made sure the colors were safe for broadcast and 
        created the sparkles on the disco ball with <a href="http://www.redgiantsoftware.com/knolsec2teso.html" target="_blank">Knoll 
          Lens Flare Pro</a>.</p>
      <p align="center" class="VNOGfontsmall"><a href="../Media/Resources/MakingAlienSong/Figure11.JPG"><img src="../Media/Resources/MakingAlienSong/Figure11.JPG" alt="" width="240" height="360" /></a></p>
      <p class="VNOGfontsmall">In total I worked 
        on this piece for about nine months on my spare time, which works out 
        to roughly 250 hours. Because it was a personal piece I allowed myself 
        the luxury of time to tweak it until I was happy with it. I also have 
        a tendency to modify his constraint setup in the middle of animating, 
        which is generally not a good thing to do in production. A lot of people 
        ask me if I had any reference for Blit's motion, and indeed some have 
        gone so far as to accuse me of using motion capture. The truth is, I had 
        neither. The way Blit is moving is just how I thought a diva would move. 
        There were some bits that I had to act out in front of a mirror to figure 
        out the mechanics, but ultimately it's all from my imagination. I must, 
        however, give credit to the members of the <a href="http://www.cgchar-animation.com/forums/index.php" target="_blank">CG 
          Char</a> mailing list for their help. It was thanks to their critiques 
        and advice that I was able to push the animation to what it is today. 
        The version of Alien Song that is floating around the internet today is 
        actually the third version I've posted. The first two (which I shudder 
        to look back upon and will refrain from posting here) were works in progress 
        that I submitted to the list for criticism, and I am indebted to those 
        professionals and novices who offered up their opinions and suggestions. </p>
      <p class="VNOGfontsmall">As for the ending, 
        I didn't want to animate the full three or four minutes of music, and 
        I was looking for a quick way out. As I said before, I'm not a big fan 
        of disco, so this seemed like the perfect opportunity for a little comic 
        irony. Some people have complained about the ending, saying that Blit 
        should get back up and keep singing. I also get a lot of requests from 
        people to do more disco lip synch animations, and I'm very wary of that. 
        I don't want to pigeonhole myself or Blit, and I'm much more interested 
        in moving on to new stories and ideas. </p>
      <p class="VNOGfontsmall">In the meantime I 
        am thrilled at the overwhelming response it has generated! I still receive 
        dozens of emails a week from people of all ages, from all over the world, 
        telling me how much they enjoyed it. Every once in a while it will turn 
        up in an newspaper or on a TV show, though usually no one bothers to ask 
        my permission. Blit and Alien Song have also garnered me many opportunities 
        such as licensing deals, speaking engagements at seminars, and most importantly, 
        a job at Pixar. One French reporter asked me if I distributed this movie 
        on the web as some sort of calculated public relations ploy. I never intended 
        this movie to travel beyond the small group of people I showed it to, 
        much less to achieve such virus-like saturation over the internet. Even 
        if I wanted to I could probably never achieve the same result again. I 
        feel very fortunate that I have received all this attention for a piece 
        that was a simple labor of love. I hope that my next animation will be 
        as well received! </p>
