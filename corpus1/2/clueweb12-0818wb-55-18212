<P>This book (soft-cover; 30.5 x 22 cm), has transcriptions of all the music 
on my Music Beyond Sound CD. The music is from the qin handbook 
<A HREF="../02qnpu/09zysz.htm"><I>Zheyin Shizi Qinpu</I></A> (<1491). 

<P>There are 120 pages of transcriptions, put into Encore, together with the 
original lyrics, by Kevin Mak; I then re-copied the original tablature 
beneath the lyrics. There are also 26 pages of  commentary in English and 
Chinese (translation by Tsui Cheong-Ming).
<P>
As of November 1998 this book was available in a few Hong Kong shops 
(e.g., HK Cultural Center; Harmony Music), but as yet there is no 
general distribution. 

<P>Here is my preface to the book.

<P><B>Commentary on <I>Music Beyond Sound</I></B>

<P>The only surviving copy of the <I>Qin Handbook of Music from the Zhejiang 
(School) Elucidated through Lyrics</I> (<I>Zheyin Shizi Qinpu</I>, 
hereafter <I>Zheyin</I>) was originally found in the <I>Tianyi Ge</I> 
library in Ningbo. Reprinted in <I>Qinqu Jicheng</I>, Vol. 1 (1st and 
2nd series, Zhonghua Bookstore, Beijing 1962 and Shanghai 1981), it has 
two folios and apparently had 42 pieces: double pages 1-4, 15-21 and 
144 (assumed to be the last page) are missing. The title is found at 
the beginning of the second folio, together with a note stating that 
the book was "compiled/explained by Antiquarian Gong Jing from the 
Banze district of Nanchang".

<P><I>Zheyin</I> consists of music thought to have been in the collection 
of Ming prince Zhu Dianpei (1418-1491), grandson of Zhu Quan, who 
published the earliest surviving compilation of qin tablature, 
<I>Shen Qi Mi Pu</I> (1425). Pieces in <I>Zheyin</I> are preceded by 
a poetic and/or historical commentary by Xi Xian (Beyond-Sound Immortal), 
probably the literary name of Zhu Dianpei. Xi Xian refers to Zhu Quan as 
his Royal Ancestor, and Zhu Dianpei succeeded his grandfather as prince 
of Nanchang in 1448. In addition, the official Ming history indicates 
Zhu Dianpei was a poet, so perhaps he wrote or adapted some of the lyrics.

<P>The recording <I>Music Beyond Sound</I> consists of the 12 complete pieces 
from <I>Zheyin</I> not previously occurring in <I>Shen Qi Mi Pu</I>, 
plus one of the two incomplete pieces. The 64 pieces of <I>Shen Qi Mi 
Pu</I> are thought to represent primarily a Song dynasty (960-1280) 
tradition, and the music in <I>Zheyin</I> may well come from the same 
type of source: 28 of its 42 pieces are identical. However, whereas 
<I>Shen Qi Mi Pu</I> had no lyrics, all <I>Zheyin</I> pieces do. The 
Chinese tablature, here hand-copied below the notation and lyrics, is 
paired according to the quite strict formula one character for almost every 
right hand and certain left hand strokes (the latter often paired with non- 
meaning syllables); generally there was no pairing with short runs, slides 
or other ornaments, while a run longer than two notes might be assigned one 
character.

<P>A later handbook, <A HREF="../02qnpu/24cxzc.htm"><B><I>Chongxiu Zhenchuan 
Qinpu</I></B></A> (1585), included 36 of the 42 pieces in <I>Zheyin</I>. 
Usually the lyrics are identical, though the melodies are somewhat, 
or even very, different. In addition, the lyrics (following the formula 
mentioned in the previous paragraph, as do almost all Ming dynasty qin 
pieces with lyrics) fit some pieces in <I>Shen Qi Mi Pu</I> not found in 
<I>Zheyin</I>, perhaps indicating those pieces were once part of a longer 
version of <I>Zheyin</I>. Again, the source of the lyrics is not given, 
though a preface criticizes the way the royal Beyond-Sound Immortal, 
assisted by Antiquarian Gong, paired lyrics and music. If any extended 
lyrics can be traced to pre-Ming dynasty sources, this will have 
significance for dating the accompanying melodies, and/or for understanding 
their method of composition.

<P>As for the missing pages in the surviving <I>Zheyin</I>, their length and 
location indicate the first part probably began with the jiao modal 
prelude, followed by <I>Lingxu Yin</I> then sections 1 to 6 of <I>Liezi 
Yufeng</I>. These three pieces were probably identical to the versions in 
<I>Shen Qi Mi Pu</I>: their lyrics in <I>Chongxiu Zhenchuan Qinpu</I> fit 
perfectly according to the formula mentioned above. <I>Zheyin</I> pages 
15-21 has just the amount of space to have included the remaining sections 
(3-11) of <I>Tiantai Yin</I> (thus the recording could include only the 
first two sections), then sections 1 to 5 of <I>Qiao Ge</I> (so the 
recording omits this entire piece).

<P><I>Zheyin</I> probably once had - or was intended to have - considerably 
more pieces. Besides the matching lyrics of <I>Chongxiu Zhenchuan Qinpu
</I>, the main evidence for this comes from the modes. Modes are of two 
types: those using standard tuning, where the relative tuning of strings 
is Sol, La, do, re, mi, sol, la (also seen as Do, Re, Fa, Sol, La, do, re); 
and those using non-standard tuning, where one or more string is re-tuned 
in relation to the others. Standard modes in <I>Shen Qi Mi Pu</I> are 
<I>gong</I>, <I>shang</I>, <I>jiao</I>, <I>zhi</I>, <I>yu</I>, and 
<I>shangjiao</I>; in addition there are seven modes using non-standard 
tuning. <I>Zheyin</I> includes all <I>Shen Qi Mi Pu</I> pieces in the 
jiao, zhi, yu, and shangjiao modes, but none from gong or shang. It 
includes all the pieces in four of the non-standard tunings, but none in 
the other three (<I>mangong</I>, <I>manshang</I> and <I>manjiao</I>). 
In other words, if <I>Zheyin</I> includes one piece from any mode in 
<I>Shen Qi Mi Pu</I>, it includes all the pieces in that mode (though 
see the next paragraph).

<P>Another oddity worthy of comment: all <I>Zheyin</I> pieces in zhi and yu 
modes (except the modal preludes) are different from their versions in 
<I>Shen Qi Mi Pu</I>, but those in jiao, shangjiao, and the non-standard 
tunings are all identical. Does this indicate that pieces in zhi and yu 
modes were actively played, and so changed? Or did the compiler of 
<I>Zheyin</I> find these pieces in another (fragmentary?) older collection?

<P>The pieces here are not compositions in the sense of music written by one person 
for others to play. Rather they are descriptions of how a qin master actually 
played a piece, using a specific form of shorthand detailing relative tuning, 
finger positions, strokes and ornaments, implying but not directly indicating 
note values. Other than its use of a few archaic descriptions of stroke 
techniques, the tablature in both <I>Shen Qi Mi Pu</I> and <I>Zheyin</I> is 
basically the same as that used today, except in its method of indicating finger 
position. <I>Specific Problems in Transcription</I>, particularly Table V et 
seq. (this is discussed in detail in the article 
<A HREF="../08anal/rhtm.htm"><B>Rhythm in <I>Zheyin Shizi Qinpu</I></B>
</A>), most of which is online).

<P>The most important differences between <I>Shen Qi Mi Pu</I> and <I>Zheyin</I> 
are that the latter is less systematic in its method of indicating finger 
positions, and it also has many obvious errors: unplayable instructions. "Slide 
up from the 9th position to the 10th position" must contain an error, since the 
9th position goes down to the 10th. Because <I>Shen Qi Mi Pu</I> has so few 
obvious mistakes, one might assume there are also few hidden mistakes, and that 
the many obvious mistakes in <I>Zheyin</I> imply many hidden mistakes as well. 
As for correcting the mistakes, in <I>Shen Qi Mi Pu</I> this was helped by the 
fact that most pieces can be found later in identical or closely related form; 
with <I>Zheyin</I> later versions seem related to a common source rather than 
directly to <I>Zheyin</I>, making them less helpful for making corrections. All 
this means that one must be very careful in making conclusions about mode based 
on the music in the recording <I>Music Beyond Sound</I>.

<P>Do the mistakes in <I>Zheyin</I> result from careless transcriptions or careless 
editing of previously accurate transcriptions? Were the pieces of <I>Zheyin</I> 
not included in <I>Shen Qi Mi Pu</I> also in the collection of Zhu Quan, who 
omitted them because there were so many errors? Or is it possible that many of 
the pieces now so clearly presented in <I>Shen Qi Mi Pu</I> once had a similar 
number of errors, so that Zhu Quan's editing was quite extensive? At present 
there are no firm answers to these questions.

<P>The old tablature perhaps at times encouraged a description of positions based 
on subjective observation rather than theoretically correctness. This could be a 
problem if, for example, the bridge on the qin in use was somewhat high, making 
the actual stopped positions somewhat lower, or if the qin studs were not 
accurately placed. A different sort of problem is that some of the tablature 
might have been partially edited by different people at different times: here 
one must consider, in addition to copying errors (particularly as it is not 
certain these pieces were at that time actively played), inconsistent usage 
within a single piece.

<P>This means that, although there is no (or only weak) evidence the tablature was 
intentionally designed to give flexibility to the performer, this is the actual 
result. For the person trying to use the tablature to reconstruct an ancient 
style this makes the task more difficult.

<P>Interpretations here reflect the player's understanding of the modality of qin 
music of that time, based on having already reconstructed all 64 pieces in 
<I>Shen Qi Mi Pu</I> as well as various pieces from other 15th and 16th century 
qin handbooks. Thus the music here should reflect the modality of those other 
books.

<P>These reconstructions focused on the instrumental idiom and its similarity with 
<I>Shen Qi Mi Pu</I>. Attention was paid to the lyrics, but in the absence of a 
Chinese tradition saying these pieces were actually ever sung, as well as a lack 
of praise for the interest and quality of the lyrics, this was made secondary to 
fluid performance. In the final transcriptions, however, some adjustments were 
made to help match the phrasing of the lyrics to that of the music, leading to 
some of the differences between the rhythms in the transcription and in the 
recording. Sung versions would certainly require even more rhythmic changes.

<P>As mentioned, all pieces in <I>Zheyin</I> had lyrics paired to the music, 
perhaps by Zhu Dianpei himself; <I>Shen Qi Mi Pu</I> had none. The pairing 
formula, as also mentioned, was one character for almost every right- and some 
left-hand strokes, but how was this accomplished? China has a long tradition of 
writing poetry to fit predetermined line lengths and patterns, so one must 
consider the possibility that the words were paired by someone who didn't know 
the music, but simply counted the strokes. In some cases the pairing seems to 
show a lack of understanding of the music; in other cases the results are quite 
singable.

<P>The normal strictness of pairing suggests that if lyrics were written (or 
adapted) to match a fixed melody, then when the pairing doesn't fit, the adapter 
either was careless or did not understand the music. If melodies were adapted to 
fit pre-existing lyrics, then when they don't fit the adapter did not want, or 
was unable, to make changes in order to allow strict conformity to the rules of 
pairing. Perhaps there was a combination of the above, originally done orally, 
then written down separately and finally combined.

<P>There are no guidelines to be found telling the intended function of these 
lyrics. Was the pairing done simply because of a theory which said qin music 
should be sung (or singable)? Were they to be sung out loud by the player or 
another person, or by the player silently? Used only as a mnemonic device? 
Recited? Note that Chinese music is traditionally heterophonic 
(see <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterophony">heterophony</A>), so the singer can alter the rhythms somewhat so as not to be following the instrument in 
unison; and through inflections (ornaments) on individual notes the singer can 
fit the tonal structure of the words to the contours of the melody. Of course, 
when accompanied by the lyrics the music would have to be played more slowly 
than can be heard on the recording. 

<P>A number of surviving 16th and 17th century qin handbooks consist of or include 
simple qin melodies with accompanying lyrics. There one can state more 
confidently that the pieces were intended to be sung.

<P>To develop a sung version of the pieces here the following is suggested: (1) 
listen to the recording to get a feeling for the melody; (2) understand the 
meaning of the lyrics; (3) practice singing the melody unaccompanied by qin, 
giving more emphasis to the natural rhythm of the words than can be found in the 
transcriptions or recordings; (4) smooth out the melody by ignoring most octave 
leaps; (5) sing freely, the qin following the voice, not vice versa; (5) sing 
quietly, as though for a late night lullaby, keeping in mind that the singer 
would have been a scholarly amateur (and not bel canto). Note that most passages 
without lyrics are repeats of passages which do have them; perhaps here the 
lyrics should be repeated as well.

<P><B>Concluding Remarks:</B>

<P>When playing qin, one never looks at the tablature: one learns pieces from a 
teacher and the tablature is largely a mnemonic device. But what of ancient 
tablature, where there is no teacher?

<P>Ancient tablature can be divided into two types: collections such as <I>Shen Qi 
Mi Pu</I>, with the stated aim of preserving pieces inherited from antiquity; 
and handbooks which presented the style of a particular qin master. To what 
extent should we consider these descriptive handbooks to be prescriptive?

<P>The Chinese tradition has always been that, though as a student you copy your 
teacher exactly, once you have achieved a certain level you are free to make 
changes: you have become part of a living tradition. Individual and regional 
styles naturally developed because the changes were influenced by environment. 
However, today in China (and not just within qin play) there is a tendency to 
combine once-distinctive regional styles into an "improved" modern system, and 
then to modify local styles accordingly. In spite of the obvious Western 
influence on the modern style, this can be a healthy trend. However, it also has 
had the negative side effect of blurring the distinctive regional styles, 
decreasing the variety. Will this lead to the survival only of one "national" 
style?

<P>Under the belief "variety is best", the aim here is to try to recapture the 
tonal, melodic, rhythmic and coloration parameters within which a lost qin style 
(or styles) might have been played. The descriptions in the old tablature have 
thus been seen as prescriptive to the extent that they might establish that "if 
you wish to play within this style, you should follow these rules." This still 
allows a large scope for creativity, and is also a basic tenet of the early 
music movement in the West: creative re-creation.

<P>The player, having tried to work out the notes as accurately as possible, then 
tried to create from this a consequent rhythmic framework (following rules 
mentioned p. xxiii, #54 below). This resulted in a sort of idealized form, found 
in the notation, which contains somewhat more regular rhythms than will be found 
on the accompanying recording: the transcriptions are of the tablature, not of 
the performance.

<P>Differences between the tablature, notation and recording then resulted (in 
addition to the adjustments mentioned above made for lyrics) from playing from 
memory, not slavishly, but trying to ensure that variations from the written 
tablature and notation are within its style. The differing versions should serve 
as a reminder that more than one interpretation is possible.

<P>(The transcriptions printed in this book were based on hand copies made during 
the reconstruction process. There the real challenge was not figuring out notes 
but working out appropriate note values, something not directly indicated in qin 
tablature. This is largely a matter of searching for structures (again see 
<A HREF="../08anal/rhtm.htm">Rhythm in <I>Zheyin Shizi Qinpu</I></A>).
Thus the layout places more emphasis on revealing musical phrase structure than 
on equal per-line note density.

<P>Barlines follow the lyrical phrasing rather than the music rhythms, hiding the 
regular rhythms in many passages; in performance these rhythms may also be 
hidden by the free interpretation.)

<P><A NAME="f1"><B>1.</B></A> 
Please note that the transcriptions use Western staff notation as though they are the Chinese number notation. In other words, C is not the modern C or the baroque C, but the relative note <I>do</I>, corresponding to the Chinese <I>gong</I> or 1. This is because there is no absolute tuning with the <I>qin</I>: the actual pitch of the strings depends on such variables as the size of the <I>qin</I>, the quality of the strings and the temperature, as well as the taste of the player. There are further comments on this under <A HREF="../08anal/mode.htm#pitch">Modality in Early Ming <I>Qin</I>Tablature</A>.
