<p><strong>QUICK CUTS:   NICHOLAS CAGE OR LIAM NEESON?<br />
Featuring a Panel of <em>Cinema Knife Fighters</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;">#  #</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL ARRUDA:  </strong>Today on <strong>QUICK CUTS</strong> we ask our panel of <strong>Cinema Knife Fighters,</strong> “If you had to choose between <strong>Nicholas Cage or Liam Neeson, </strong>which one would you rather see in a movie?”</p>
<p>We pose this question because both these guys have carved out niches for themselves of late, starring in a string of successful action movies. And because they both make a ton of movies, they each have had their share of misfires.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong> </strong><a href="http://cinemaknifefight.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/nicolas-cage-picture-2.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6092" title="nicolas-cage-picture-2" src="http://cinemaknifefight.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/nicolas-cage-picture-2.jpg?w=450" alt=""   /></a><strong></strong></p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>CHALLENGER # 1 &#8211; NICOLAS CAGE</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, Cage or Neeson?  Does anyone have an opinion on this?</p>
<p><strong>GARRETT COOK</strong>:  Hell yes, I have an opinion on this!</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES</strong>:  I should hope so!  You’re on the flippin panel!</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL ARRUDA</strong>:  We might as well start this one off with a bang.</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES</strong>:  So, what’s your opinion?</p>
<p><strong>GARRETT COOK</strong>:  With the exception of his roles in <strong>DRIVE ANGRY</strong> (2011) and <strong>KICK-ASS</strong> (2010) Nicholas Cage makes me want to bite him until he dies every time he plagues my screen with this vomity acting, slow talking, and stupid, stupid face.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL ARRUDA:  </strong>Wow, I guess you do have an opinion! Is “vomity” even a word?</p>
<p><strong>GARRETT COOK:  </strong>You know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL ARRUDA:  </strong>I certainly do. And I can’t say I disagree with you.</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES</strong>:  Well, I disagree, but I’ll wait a bit before I prove you wrong.</p>
<p><strong>MARK OSNPAUGH</strong>:  Ouch!</p>
<p><strong>GARRETT COOK:  </strong>Liam Neeson is a street-smart man-god, who kills white slavers and was the best character in <strong>GANGS OF NEW YORK</strong> (2002). I forgive him for his involvement in <strong>STAR WARS EPISODE I &#8211; THE PHANTOM MENACE </strong>(1999).</p>
<p>Neeson over Cage.</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES</strong>: Actually, Daniel-Day Lewis was the best thing in <strong>GANGS OF NEW YORK</strong>. In fact, I thought he was the <strong><em>only</em></strong> thing memorable about that movie.</p>
<p><strong>MARK ONSPAUGH</strong>:  My turn.</p>
<p>While I love the goofball eccentricity Cage brings to his roles, I find myself thanking God every day he was <strong><em>not</em></strong> Superman&#8230;</p>
<p>(The panel rises in unison and cheers, except for <strong>L.L. SOARES</strong>, who boos)</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES</strong>: Cage would have made an excellent Superman!</p>
<p><strong>MARK ONSPAUGH</strong>: I’ll pretend you didn’t say that. Also, if the there was a chance to see either one in a kick-ass movie, then I would go with Neeson—his voice is awesome (witness the voice-overs for <strong>Star Wars: The Old Republic</strong> commercials) and he brings a certain gravitas to his serious roles&#8230; Was he not a major bad-ass in <strong>TAKEN</strong> (2008)? And let&#8217;s not forget he was <strong>DARKMAN </strong>(1990), Gawain in <strong>EXCALIBUR</strong> (1981), Kegan in <strong>KRULL</strong> (1983), <strong>ROB ROY</strong> (1995), Zeus in <strong>CLASH OF THE TITANS</strong> (2010)&#8230; <strong><em>AND</em></strong> freaking Ras Al-Ghul in the Nolan <strong>Batman</strong> trilogy&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL ARRUDA</strong>:  While I liked him as <strong>DARKMAN</strong>, I can’t say I was ever too excited by those other roles.</p>
<p><strong>MARK ONSPAUGH</strong>:  Plus, he&#8217;s proved he can have fun in popcorn fare like <strong>THE A-TEAM</strong> (2010). I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s his training or his tragedy (probably both), but I &#8220;buy&#8221; Neeson much more than Cage&#8230; Did I mention he&#8217;s Aslan in <strong>NARNIA</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL ARRUDA:  </strong>Nope, and I wish you hadn’t!</p>

<p><strong>MARK ONSPAUGH:  </strong>Now, the real question—how about the two together as in-laws?</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES:  </strong>Well, for the record<strong>, </strong>I have to admit, I love them both.</p>
<p><strong>MARK ONSPAUGH:  </strong>Hmm, maybe we should be considering Cage, Neeson, and <strong><em>Soares</em> </strong>as in-laws?</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES</strong>:  Huh?  Wait, how many in-laws can a person have?</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL ARRUDA</strong>:  All three of you could be <strong><em>brothers-in-law</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES</strong>:  Too confusing.  Let me just make my points.</p>
<p>When Cage brings his over-the-top lunacy to a movie, it can turn a mediocre film into a campy treat. But there was a time when he was a serious actor. Back when he won the Oscar for <strong>LEAVING LAS VEGAS (1995)</strong>, and had roles in <strong>WILD AT HEART (1990)</strong> and <strong>KISS OF DEATH </strong>(1995).</p>
<p>But by the time he started appearing in action fare like <strong>THE ROCK</strong> (1996) and <strong>CON-AIR </strong>(1997), he had already become a parody of himself. Then something weird happened. He took that parody version of himself and pushed it all the way through to the other side.</p>
<p>Now in stuff like <strong>BAD LIETUENANT: PORT OF CALL NEW ORLEANS </strong>(2009), and <strong>DRIVE ANGRY </strong>(2011), he&#8217;s turned his eccentricities into an art form.</p>
<p><strong>GARRETT COOK</strong>:  Yeah, <strong><em>bad</em></strong> art!</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES</strong>:  Even though I look forward to most movies Cage is in, I won&#8217;t see <strong><em>everything</em></strong>. I still haven&#8217;t seen his <strong>NATIONAL TREASURE</strong> movies, nor do I plan to.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL ARRUDA</strong>:  Smart move. You’re not missing much.</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES</strong>:  I can also live without seeing <strong>FAMILY MAN</strong> (2000) and <strong>THE SORCERER&#8217;S APPRENTICE </strong>(2010). I just have no desire to see Cage in any kind of &#8220;family&#8221; film.</p>
<p>Neeson is the more serious of the two, but even he has had his low points. As Garrett mentioned, he was Qui-Gon Jinn in <strong>STAR WARS EPISODE 1 – THE PHANTOM MENACE</strong>, a character who just did nothing for me. And he was a ho-hum Zeus in the awful <strong>CLASH OF THE TITANS</strong> remake. But even in bad movies and less than stellar roles, he seems to rise above the crap and maintain his dignity. There is an air of authority and gravitas that Neeson brings to every role, so he’s always watchable, at least. His more recent action fare with <strong>TAKEN</strong>, <strong>UNKNOWN </strong>(2011) and <strong>THE GREY </strong>(2012) have been a lot more entertaining than they have any right to be, and I can’t wait to see more of this “new” Liam Neeson.</p>
<div id="attachment_6094" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 460px"><a href="http://cinemaknifefight.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/the-grey-film-poster.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6094" title="The Grey Film Poster" src="http://cinemaknifefight.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/the-grey-film-poster.jpg?w=450&#038;h=694" alt="" width="450" height="694" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Neeson&#039;s latest film is THE GREY.</p></div>
<p>But at this point, I look forward to any new movie either of them puts out. Even if they’re in bad movies, they’re still more entertaining than 90% of the rest of the actors out there.</p>
<p><strong>COLLEEN WANGLUND</strong>:  I&#8217;ve liked Nic Cage in a handful of movies—.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL ARRUDA</strong>:  <strong><em>Nic </em></strong>Cage?</p>
<p><strong>MARK ONSPAUGH:  </strong>I’m adding Colleen to the in-law list with Cage, Neeson, and Soares.</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES</strong>:  Huh?</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL ARRUDA (laughing)</strong>:  Yeah, she’s the sister in-law.</p>
<p><strong>COLLEEN WANGLUND:  </strong>As I was saying, I’ve liked Nic Cage in a handful of movies, like <strong>LEAVING LAS VEGAS</strong> (1995), <strong>WILD AT HEART</strong> (1990), <strong>RAISING ARIZONA</strong> (1987), and <strong>MOONSTRUCK</strong> (1987)—but for the most part I think Cage &#8220;phones it in&#8221;.</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES:  </strong>I don’t think so. I think he hams it up in a fun way, and sometimes people miss that in his performances.</p>
<p><strong>COLLEEN WANGLUND:  </strong>Well, in my opinion, Liam Neeson is just a better actor, regardless of the movie role.</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES:  </strong>I agree Neeson is the better actor, but Cage won an Oscar! That said, they’re both doing their best work in movies that many people might consider beneath them. Well, beneath Neeson at least…</p>
<p><strong>GARRETT COOK</strong>:  We’re talking too much about Cage. Someone hand me a barf bag!</p>
<p><strong>COLLEEN WANGLUND:  </strong>Well, that’s my answer.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL ARRUDA</strong>:  Liam Neeson or Nicholas Cage?</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES:  </strong>Yeah, that’s the question, you dolt. Are you going to answer it or repeat it again?</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL ARRUDA:  </strong>For you, I might just repeat it, but since we have an entire panel here tonight, I’ll let it go. But now it’s my turn.</p>
<p>Up until a few years ago, I wasn’t a fan of either one of these actors.</p>
<p>Way back when, I did like Neeson in his early roles, in films like <strong>SUSPECT</strong>  (1987) and <strong>THE MISSION</strong> (1986), and of course, he was outstanding in <strong>SCHINDLER’S LIST</strong> (1992). But surprisingly he failed to impress me in <strong>LES MISERABLE</strong> (1998), and then came a string of roles that just didn’t wow me, starting with <strong>STAR WARS EPISODE I &#8211; THE PHANTOM MENACE</strong> and including such movies as <strong>BATMAN BEGINS</strong> (2005), the <strong>NARNIA</strong> movies, and <strong>CLASH OF THE TITANS</strong>. Of course, I didn’t see <strong><em>everything</em></strong> Neeson made during these years, but what I <strong><em>was</em></strong> seeing wasn’t doing much for me. I mean, he was fine in these films, but he wasn’t outstanding.</p>
<p>However, I’ve <strong><em>really</em></strong> enjoyed Neeson lately in films like <strong>CHLOE</strong> (2009), <strong>UNKNOWN</strong> and <strong>THE GREY</strong>. He’s been excellent in these movies.</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES</strong>: I liked <strong>CHLOE</strong> a lot, too.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL ARRUDA</strong>: Cage always seems to grate on my nerves.</p>
<p><strong>GARRETT COOK</strong>:  Would you like a barf bag?</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL ARRUDA</strong>:  No thanks. He never made me want to throw up, but he does get under my skin.</p>
<p>Like with Neeson, I did enjoy some of his early movies, like <strong>RAISING ARIZONA</strong> (1987) and <strong>MOONSTRUCK</strong> (1987)</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES</strong>: <strong>MOONSTRUCK</strong>? That’s what you consider to be a good Nicolas Cage movie? Gimme <strong>LEAVING LAS VEGAS</strong> and <strong>WILD AT HEART</strong> over those any day.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL ARRUDA</strong>:  I think he’s pretty darn good in <strong>MOONSTRUCK</strong>, but as his career went on he appeared in movies I either didn’t like or wasn’t interested in seeing. His appearance in <strong>THE ROCK</strong> (1996) began a stretch of action movies I wasn’t crazy about.</p>
<p>Also like Neeson, I’ve enjoyed some recent performances by Cage, in such movies as <strong>SEASON OF THE WITCH</strong> (2011) and <strong>DRIVE ANGRY 3D</strong> (2011). However, the big difference between the two is Neeson’s recent roles have left me wanting to see whatever he’s doing next. I can’t say the same for Cage.</p>

<p>So, Liam Neeson or Nicholas Cage?</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES</strong>:  Are you repeating the question <strong><em>again?</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL ARRUDA:  </strong>That’s my gift to you.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’m going with Neeson.</p>
<p><strong>NICK CATO:  </strong>Here&#8217;s my two cents.</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES</strong>:  Hey, Nick!  You’re here!</p>
<p><strong>NICK CATO:  </strong>Yep, I’m here.</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES</strong>:  You’ve been so quiet, I hadn’t noticed you!</p>
<p><strong>DANIEL KEOHANE:  </strong>I’m here too. Waiting patiently, while you guys continue to dominate the conversation.</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES:  </strong>Quit whining!  We’ll get to you!</p>
<p><strong>DANIEL KEOHANE:  </strong>I’d like to think you’re saving the best for last.</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES:  </strong>You can think that all you want, but it’s not true!  (laughs).</p>
<p><strong>MARK ONSPAUGH</strong>:  I could add you to the “in-laws” list if that would make you feel any better.</p>
<p><strong>GARRETT COOK</strong>:  How about a barf bag?</p>
<p><strong>DANIEL KEOHANE:  </strong>No, no. I’m good. (Feigns a pouty face.)</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL ARRUDA:  </strong>How about your two cents, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>NICK CATO:  </strong>I&#8217;ve been a big Nicolas Cage fan since seeing him in <strong>RAISING ARIZONA</strong> (1987).</p>
<p>While there&#8217;s no denying Liam Neeson is a great (and better) actor —I especially liked him in <strong>KINSEY</strong> (2004) —a lot of roles he chooses simply don&#8217;t interest me. Cage is always over the top, comical, and while a lot of people don&#8217;t care for it, I love his constant neo-Elvis persona (his role as Sailor Ripley in David Lynch&#8217;s <strong>WILD AT HEART</strong> (1990) was priceless). Regardless of who is directing him (be it Lynch, Werner Herzog, or the Coen Brothers), Cage always makes these unique roles his own.</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES:  </strong>I think a lot of people don’t get Nicholas Cage.</p>
<p><strong>GARRETT COOK:  </strong>I get him. He just makes me sick!</p>
<p><strong>DANIEL KEOHANE:  </strong>Is it finally my turn?</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES:  </strong>Yes, it’s finally your turn!</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL ARRUDA:  </strong>Go for it.</p>
<p><strong>DANIEL KEOHANE:  </strong>The way they each approach their roles is completely different. Cage takes on more “Everyman” characters caught in larger-than-life situations. Neeson, though also in predicament-type movies, seems more bent on suspense films vs. Cage&#8217;s science fiction/fantasy/action roles.</p>
<p>And Neeson carries a more—if this makes any sense—<strong><em>literary</em></strong> air about himself.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL ARRUDA:  </strong>Yeah, I know what you mean. There’s an intellectual presence in his roles. He almost carries himself like he’s a college professor</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES:  </strong>Yeah, a college professor who kicks some serious ass!</p>
<p><strong>DANIEL KEOHANE:  </strong>Cage does more of a comic book kind of thing.</p>
<p>Or here’s an even worse metaphor: Neeson is multi-grain to Cage&#8217;s Wonder Bread. I like them both, depending on my appetite.</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL ARRUDA:  </strong>I don’t see Cage as Wonder Bread. He’s more like Beer Bread.</p>
<p><strong>L.L. SOARES:  </strong>What the hell is beer bread?</p>
<p><strong>MICHAEL ARRUDA:  </strong>Bread made with beer. It’s good. But if you eat too much of it, you won’t be feeling too good. Kinda like watching Nicholas Cage.</p>
<p>Well, thanks everyone for taking part in tonight’s <strong>QUICK CUTS </strong>column. For what it’s worth, the voting tonight went <strong>LIAM NEESON – 6, NICHOLAS CAGE – 3, </strong>so this panel clearly favored Neeson.</p>
<p>On behalf of Garrett Cook, Mark Onspaugh, Colleen Wanglund, Nick Cato, Dan Keohane, L.L. Soares and myself, Michael Arruda, thank you all for joining us, and we’ll see you next time!</p>

<p><strong>My Top 6  Movies of 2011<br />
By Garrett Cook</strong></p>
<p><strong>6. Drive Angry</strong></p>
<p>As much as I can&#8217;t stand excessive CGI or Nicholas Cage, this movie was everything Hobo With a Shotgun claimed to be but fell short of. A pure adrenaline rush.</p>
<p><strong>5. Chillerama</strong></p>
<p>Transgressive fun. Giant sperm. An AIP beach movie gone horribly wrong and Hitler plagued by an insubordinate golem. What&#8217;s not to like?</p>
<p style="text-align:center;"><strong><a href="http://cinemaknifefight.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/chillerama_11x17_lo-copy1.jpeg"><img title="Chillerama_11x17_lo copy" src="http://cinemaknifefight.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/chillerama_11x17_lo-copy1.jpeg?w=450&#038;h=695" alt="" width="450" height="695" /></a></strong></p>
<p><strong>4. Super 8</strong></p>
<p>A little bit Stephen King, a little bit Stephen Spielberg. A surprisingly sincere and sweet movie.</p>
<p><strong>3. Rubber<br />
</strong></p>
<p>A movie that makes you root for a psychotic and psychokinetic tire and reexamine how you think of storytelling. An impressive Bizarro feat.</p>
<p><strong>2. The Last Circus</strong></p>
<p>An amazing piece of work. A union of Guillermo del Toro and Todd Browning&#8217;s aesthetics, with a dose of Jodorowsky. An eyepopping and moving struggle for love between two clowns in Fascist Spain. It&#8217;s streaming on Netflix and you should watch it.</p>
<p><a href="http://cinemaknifefight.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/captain_america_the_first_avenger.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5631" title="captain_america_the_first_avenger" src="http://cinemaknifefight.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/captain_america_the_first_avenger.jpg?w=450&#038;h=664" alt="" width="450" height="664" /></a></p>
<p><strong>1. Captain America</strong></p>
<p>Finally, a comic movie that is not ashamed of being a comic book. Full of Marvel history and a balance of action and emotional content, which is a difficult one to pull off. Dieselpunk genius. My favorite Marvel movie hands down. Maybe my favorite superhero movie.</p>

<p><strong>Cinema Knife Fight: DRIVE ANGRY 3D<br />
By L.L. Soares (and Michael Arruda)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://cinemaknifefight.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/drive-angry.jpg"></a><a href="http://cinemaknifefight.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/drive-angry1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3146" title="Drive-Angry" src="http://cinemaknifefight.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/drive-angry1.jpg?w=450&#038;h=667" alt="" width="450" height="667" /></a></p>
<p><strong><em>FADE IN</em></strong></p>
<p>(The scene: A long stretch of highway. LL SOARES is driving a Dodge Charger as fast as it can go, miles of desert on either side of him. Motorhead’s song “Ace of Spades” plays loud over the car stereo)</p>
<p>LS (shouting): Oh there you are. I’m here driving solo, reviewing the new movie <strong>DRIVE ANGRY</strong> that just came out in theaters. My sidekick is bowing out on this one…</p>
<p>(The music stops and MICHAEL ARRUDA’s voice comes on the radio)</p>
<p>MA: Hello? You there?</p>
<p>LS: Hey! I was enjoying that song!</p>
<p>MA: Yeah, well, I just want to set the record straight. I didn’t bow out on this one on purpose. I’m stuck at my house buried under several feet of snow; snow, it seems, that has been falling since January!  I mean, the snow banks around here have gotten so big they’re going to start lending money.</p>
<p>LS (turns off radio):  Like anybody cares. I was enjoying that song. Hopefully, he’s gone now. (Turns on radio. “Ace of Spades” is playing again.)  That’s more like it. So, where was I?  Yeah, <strong>DRIVE ANGRY</strong>.</p>
<p>(MA’s voice returns on the radio.)</p>
<p>MA:  What do you mean?  Nobody cares?  I have readers who would care if I’m stuck in the snow someplace.</p>
<p>(Flash to a little old lady seated in front of a computer, tapping impatiently at the screen rather than the keyboard.)</p>
<p>LITTLE OLD LADY:  Where’s that Michael Arruda?  I haven’t seen his reviews in a while. He writes such sweet things about these movies.</p>
<p>(Scene returns to LS driving in car.)</p>
<p>LS:  Hey, how did you know what I said if I shut the radio off first?</p>
<p>MA:  Actually, you dissed me <strong><em>as</em></strong> you were turning the radio off.</p>
<p>LS (grimaces at camera):  Yeah, I’ll buy that. <strong><em>Sure.</em></strong></p>
<p>MA: So what did you think of <strong>DRIVE ANGRY</strong>?</p>
<p>LS: Actually, the full title is<strong> DRIVE ANGRY 3D</strong>, I guess. Although I’m sure some theaters somewhere were showing it in 2D.</p>
<p>DRIVE ANGRY gives us Nicolas Cage as John Milton (get it?)&#8212;.</p>
<p>MA:  &#8212;That would be a reference to that classic of literature, <strong><em>PARADISE LOST</em></strong> by John Milton.</p>
<p>LS:  Thank you, Professor. But this John Milton is a long-haired, intense guy who just escaped from hell in a souped-up car.</p>
<p>Turns out Hell is just a giant prison, and he’s a breakout artist. The reason he’s come back is to save his baby granddaughter, who has been abducted by Satanists. The baby’s mother – John’s daughter – was part of a cult, but got second thoughts, so the leader, the charismatic Jonah King (Billy Burke), killed her and took her baby, and is planning to use the infant to make a blood sacrifice to Satan. The plan being to open a portal and bring Hell to earth.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a demonic lawman, called only The Accountant (William Fichtner) is hot on Milton’s trail, intent to bringing him back to the land of fire and brimstone. (Most people probably know Fichtner as the crooked federal agent from the TV series <strong>PRISON BREAK.</strong>)</p>
<p>Along the way, Milton picks up feisty blonde firecracker Piper (Amber Heard), at first for her car, and then later the two bond and she agrees to help him get his granddaughter back.</p>
<p>So Jonah King and his men are out to kill Milton. So is The Accountant. And Milton is intent on avoiding The Accountant and killing King and his minions, and saving the baby. Got it so far?</p>
<p>MA: Yep.</p>
<p>(We go back to the LITTLE OLD LADY, who is now getting into a souped-up 1957 Chevy and is gunning the engine)</p>
<p>LITTLE OLD LADY: I’ll teach them to give me a Cinema Knife Fight review without sweet little Michael Arruda! <strong><em>GOSH DARN IT!</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong></p>
<p>(She peels out in a screech of tires)</p>
<p>(Back to LS)</p>
<p>LS: This movie creates its mood right from the get go, letting us know this is going to be an all-out, over-the-top, balls-to-the-wall, live-action loony tune from the very first scene. Nick Cage does his usual hammy overacting (he gives an enjoyable performance here, but it’s getting harder and harder to believe this guy once won an Oscar) as Milton, and Fichtner is damn near perfect as the demonic Accountant (who looks exactly like the FBI man he keeps telling everyone he is – his suit doesn’t get rumpled even once). Hell, the acting is good all around here, including Burke (the dad from the<strong> TWILIGHT </strong>movies – I knew he looked familiar) as the very charismatic Jonah King (you can believe this guy leads a cult) and the hot, tough, and fun-to-watch Heard as Piper. Other good supporting players include David Morse as Milton’s long-time friend, Webster, and Tom Atkins as the chief of police trying to chase everyone else down.</p>
<p>From the trailers, I thought this was just going to be a straight story of a normal guy chasing down the cultists who stole his daughter (is Nick Cage really old enough to play grandfathers now? I guess he is). I didn’t find out about the supernatural elements until a few days before the movie opened, and I didn’t know what to expect from that. All this talk of Hell and demons and vengeance smacks a lot of a previous Cage outing,<strong> GHOST RIDER</strong> (2007), which was flawed at best. But for some reason, it all works better here. John Milton is a man on a mission and Cage gives us enough intensity and his just plain patented goofiness throughout to keep the fans wanting more.</p>
<p>(Cherry red ’57 Chevy roars up behind him and drives up beside him)</p>
<p>LITTLE OLD LADY: Where is Michael Arruda this week, you mean man!</p>
<p>LS: Huh? What are you talking about? I’m trying to do a movie review here, lady.</p>
<p>LITTLE OLD LADY: Damn, smartass kids!</p>
<p>(She pulls out a shotgun and aims it at LS)</p>
<p>LITTLE OLD LADY: I represent “<strong><em>Old Timers For Arruda</em></strong>” and we are not going to tolerate reviews that leave him out.</p>
<p>LS: Lady, he’s stuck in the snow. It’s not my fault.</p>
<p>LITTLE OLD LADY: Not good enough, sonny!</p>
<p>(Before she can shoot, LS rams her car with his, and she goes over the railing, spinning down the hills, bursting into a giant ball of flame)</p>
<p>LS: So long, sucker! (cackles in glee)</p>
<p>Where was I?</p>
<p>MA (voice on the radio): You were wrapping up your review, I think. I have to admit, I’m sad you killed that old lady. She sounded very smart.</p>
<p>LS: Yeah, it is kind of sad to think I might have killed off your only fan.</p>
<p>MA: Get to the review!</p>
<p>LS: The dialogue gets a little absurd at times, but the silliest lines are the ones coming out of Cage’s mouth, and he says them as if they were diamonds. No one makes bad dialogue sound good and funny like Nicolas Cage.</p>
<p>For the most part, the script is pretty good, the acting top-notch, and the direction by Patrick Lussier &#8211; whose remake of <strong>MY BLOODY VALENTINE</strong> (also in 3D) in 2009 was one of the better horror flicks since the new 3D renaissance – keeps things moving at a nice speed throughout. Sure, there are plenty of goofy aspects to the proceedings, but they’re all part of the ride—speaking of which, there are also some very cool cars in this flick, too.</p>
<p>Is the 3D worth it? Well, there are stretches where you kind of don’t notice (as is the case with a lot of 3D movies), and then, suddenly, a bullet will come your way, or part of someone’s skull will hurtle towards you. This movie earns its R rating with plenty of blood and dismemberment, as well plenty of nude girls, so what’s not to love? That said, I’m still not a big fan of the whole 3D thing, and didn’t think it added that much to the movie. I still think the entire 3D craze is a sham created to raise ticket prices and sell new televisions. But when a movie is an entertaining as this one – and most 3D movies <strong><em>aren’t</em></strong> – I’m willing to let it slide. But I bet it would have been just as fun in regular 2D.</p>
<p>MA:  I’m with you on this point. The majority of the new 3D movies haven’t been worth the extra ticket prices.</p>
<p>LS:  So is this movie worth seeing? Hell yeah. After the showing I went to, there were surveys so I filled one out. One question asked “Why did you want to see this movie?” and I checked off “Nicolas Cage” with a giant X next to his name, and smaller x’s for William Fichtner and the fact that it was “Directed by the guy who made <strong>MY BLOODY VALENTINE</strong>.”</p>
<p><strong>DRIVE ANGRY</strong> is a hoot and a holler and a drag race out of hell and back. I give it three and a half knives.</p>
<p>MA:  Sounds like a lot of fun, and I’m sorry I missed it.</p>
<p>(LITTLE OLD LADY’s voice come on the radio)</p>
<p>LITTLE OLD LADY: You better be part of the next review, Michael! I am boiling mad!</p>
<p>(LS turns off the radio. The vast desert on either side of him turns into walls of flame as he takes a right turn into Hell)</p>
<p>LS: Well, I’m home. So long folks! See you next time.</p>
