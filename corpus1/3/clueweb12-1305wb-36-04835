The fundamental concern with the Electoral College is its <em>representational unreliability;</em> i.e., the <em>risk</em> that the electoral vote will contradict the popular vote.

                    <li>At the federal level, significantly increase the the size of the House of Representatives. The corresponding increase in the number of Electors ensures that the Electoral College will be more representative of the general population. <br>

Each state is allowed a number of <em>electors</em> equal to the total number of their Congressional delegation (i.e., House plus Senate representatives). In other words, the size of a state&#8217;s delegation to the Electoral College is equal to the number of its House Representatives <em>plus two</em>. For example, Delaware has <em>one</em> House Representative and <em>two</em> Senators; this entitles them to  <em>three</em> electors.<br>
<br>

In addition to the states&#8217; electors, the District of Columbia (D.C.) is allowed a number of electors equal to that of the <em>smallest</em> state (Delaware) giving them a delegation of three. 
The result is an Electoral College which currently totals 538 people (illustrated in the pie chart to the right).<br>
&nbsp;<br>
Looking at the pie chart to the right, it is easy to see how increasing the size of the House of Representatives results in a larger Electoral College. As explained below, this increase also ensures that the Electoral College will better reflect the popular vote.</p>                  </td><td width="2%" valign="top">&nbsp;</td>

              The larger the Electoral College, the more likely that it will correctly reflect the popular vote. This is the conclusion reached by two California State University mathematicians in an analysis of the 2000 Presidential election (in which Al Gore received a higher percentage of the popular vote, but  George Bush won the majority of the electoral votes).<br>
&nbsp; <br>
The Neubauer-Zeitlin analysis observes that <em>&#8220;the winner of the 2000 presidential election was determined in 1941 when the House size was fixed at 435. Had the House size been set at 500 ... then Gore would have won the 2000 election!&#8221;</em> 
  Focusing on the 2000 Presidential election, the principal observations made by the Neubauer-Zeitlin Analysis are as follows:</p>
              
              <div align="justify">
                  <ul>
                    <li>The larger the Electoral College, the more likely it will reflect the outcome of the popular vote. In the case of the 2000 election, for all House sizes <em>less than</em> 492, the Electoral College goes to Bush. For all House sizes <em>greater than</em> 654, Gore would have been elected President. <br>
&nbsp;                    </li>
                      <li>                      For House sizes between 492 and 654, a troubling scenario is created: the  results fluctuate (seemingly randomly) between Bush, Gore or a tie. <br>
&nbsp;                    </li>
                      <li>The smaller states &#8212; which favored Bush in the 2000 election &#8212; are <em>over-represented</em> in the Electoral College. The 22 smallest states had a total of 98 Electoral votes, though their combined population was roughly equal to that of California which had only 54 Electoral votes. Of their 98 Electoral votes, 37 went for Gore while 61 went for Bush. </li>
                  </ul>
              </div>              
              <p align="justify">Referring to the current composition of the Electoral College, their conclusion is that<em> &#8220;... our present method not only goes against the popular vote in the recent election but this instability further highlights the fact that the election of our president by a supposedly fair and trustworthy method depends capriciously on the choice of the House size. We believe that this is a major flaw in the current method of electing a president.&#8221;</em> <br>
                <br>
              The authors suggested three possible solutions that could ameliorate these problems. The first two proposals (below) would require a Constitutional amendment, which  greatly limits their potentiality. </p>
                <div align="justify">
                  <ol>
                    <li>Replace the Electoral College with the <u>direct&nbsp;election</u> of the President  (with the winner determined by a  plurality of the vote). One concern with this  method is the risk of third-party candidates drawing disproportionately from one candidate. <br>
&nbsp;                    </li>
                      <li>                    <u>Modify&nbsp;the&nbsp;Electoral&nbsp;College</u> so that each state&#8217;s delegation is equal <em>only</em> to its representation in the House (eliminating the additional two delegates). This would substantially eliminate the small state bias. <br>
&nbsp;                      </li>
                      <li>                    <u>Modify&nbsp;the&nbsp;states&#8217;&nbsp;<em>method</em>&nbsp;of&nbsp;allocating&nbsp;its&nbsp;Electors</u> by replacing the <em>winner-take-all</em> model &#8212; currently  used by 48 states &#8212; with the method used by Maine and Nebraska: give an elector to the winner  of each congressional district;  the additional 
      two electors goes to the winner of the plurality of the statewide vote. This  proposal has the advantage of <em>not</em> requiring a constitutional amendment, but rather could be implemented by the state legislatures. </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>Any means which utilizes the Electoral College (as  do the last two suggestions above) will always be at risk of producing unpredictable electoral results <em>as long as the House of Representatives remains undersized</em>.</p>

For example, Wyoming (the smallest state on the far left) enjoys an electoral representation ratio of 3.05, while the ratio for California (the largest state) is 0.84. <br>

              Therefore, maintaining the smaller House district sizes envisioned by our nation&#8217;s founders would substantially reduce the problem of the small states being over-represented  in the Electoral College.

                <p>                  The recommendation here is to replace the <em>winner-takes-all</em> method currently used by 48 states with the <em>proportional method</em> for allocating electoral votes used by Maine and Nebraska. Proportional allocation of Electors works as follows:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li> Award one elector to the winner of the plurality of <em>each congressional district</em>; and, <br>
                  </li>
                  <li>Award the two additional electors to the winner of the plurality of the statewide vote.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>As an example, in the 2000 presidential election Bush would have won 19 of California&rsquo;s 54 electors since he won the plurality of votes in 19 of California&rsquo;s congressional districts. Gore would have won the remaining 35 electors; 33 of those as a result of winning the plurality of votes in congressional districts and two of those for winning the plurality of votes in the state. Under the winner-takes-all method,  all 54 electors were awarded to Gore. <br>
                  <br>
                  The maps below help illustrate this concept. The map  on the left shows the homogenizing effect of consolidating the state-wide popular vote totals, which is how the 2000 election was determined. <br>
                  <br>
                  <em> In contrast</em>, the map on the right is a  mosaic showing the winner <em>by county</em> (i.e.,  the winner of the plurality of the popular vote in each county). <br>

              Americans elect the President and Vice-president through a method of indirect popular election. On November 2, 2004, voters cast their ballots for a presidential candidate. However, votes actually count towards a group of electors who pledge to vote for a specific candidate when the Electoral College meets in December. The &#8220;Electoral College&#8221; is the unofficial term coined in the 1800s for the group of citizens selected by the people to cast votes for President and Vice President.<BR>
              <BR>
              The presidential/vice-presidential pair who wins the popular vote in any given state receives all of the state&#8217;s number of Electoral College votes. (The exceptions are Maine and Nebraska.)<br>
              <br>
              In the end, the winner of the race is the candidate who receives a majority (270) of the 538 Electoral College votes. The results of the 2004 election won&#8217;t be official until the President of the Senate counts the votes out loud at a special joint session of Congress held on January 6, 2005. </p>

  The <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.amendmentxii.html%20" target="_blank">12th&nbsp;Amendment</a> to our Constitution outlines the process for electing the President of the United States. This indirect method of popular election is known as the Electoral College. While some state laws regarding this process differ, the general method for electing the president is listed below.</p>
              <div align="justify">
                  <UL>
                    <LI>Before the November election, political parties in each state create lists of potential electors (generally active members of the party) who pledge to vote for the party&#8217;s candidate in the Electoral College.<BR>
&nbsp;                    
                    <LI>A state&#8217;s number of electoral votes equals the number of the state&#8217;s Congressional delegation [the number of U.S. Senators (always 2) <em>plus</em> the number of U.S. Representatives.] The District of Columbia receives three electoral votes, as determined by the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.amendmentxxiii.html" target="_blank">23rd Amendment</a> to the Constitution. See <A 
href="http://www.vote-smart.org/election_president_electoral_college.php">Electoral College Votes per State</A> for your state&#8217;s number of electoral votes.<BR>
&nbsp;                    
                    <LI>On November 2, 2004, Voters cast their ballots for a block of electors who, in turn, will vote for a certain presidential candidate. The winner of the popular vote in each state receives the state&#8217;s entire number of Electoral College votes. (The exceptions are Maine and Nebraska where a proportional method for allocating votes is used.)<BR>
                    &nbsp;<BR>
                    <em>For example</em>, if a Democratic presidential candidate receives the most votes in Texas, the 34 Democratic electors become the voting block representing the Lone Star state. Therefore, the Democratic presidential candidate receives 34 of the 538 total votes in the Electoral College. The winner of the 2004 Presidential Election is the candidate who collects 270 votes, the majority.<BR>

At this meeting, the electors sign the <em>Certificate of Vote</em>, which is sealed and delivered to the Office of the President of the United States Senate.<BR>

              <li> The Electoral College, in recognizing a role for states in the selection of the president, reminds us of their importance in our federal system. <br>
&nbsp; </li>
              <li>It enhances the status of minority interests.<br>
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li>The Electoral College encourages more person-to-person campaigning by candidates, as they spend time in both the big cities and smaller cities in battleground states. <br>
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li>In close, contested elections, recounts will usually be confined to a state or two, rather than an across-the-country recount that might be required if we had direct election of the president. <br>
&nbsp;              </li>
              <li> The Electoral College, with its typical winner-take-all allocation of votes, often turns a small percentage margin of victory into one that appears much larger, thus making the victory seem more conclusive and adding to the winner&#8217;s perceived legitimacy. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
              <li> Finally, the electoral college system has worked. No election in this century has been decided in the House of Representatives. There is uncertainty over whether any other method would be an improvement and that an effort to change the system could lead to the dismantling of the federal system.</li>
