<H2>Starting Our Sixth Year On The Net</H2>
<P align="left">&nbsp;</P>
<P align="left">It is with a great deal of admitted self-serving pleasure that 
  we celebrate the beginning of our sixth year as the first and number one pioneering 
  Sheet Music Cover - MIDI site on the Internet. From very humble beginnings in 
  1997 to today's acclaimed and much imitated site, we have weathered over five 
  years in an environment where much has come and gone. We've never missed an 
  issue, never been late with an issue and have published nearly 1,000 sheet music 
  covers with accompanying music. Almost two million visitors have seen our work 
  and each month, the number increases. </P>
<P align="left">We've established a number of firsts in our five years;</P>
<ul>
  <li>We were the first site to accompany sheet music covers with MIDI music.</li>
  <li>We were the first site to include composer biographies and historic information 
    about individual songs along with the images and music.</li>
  <li>We were the first site to establish a monthly magazine format.</li>
  <li>We were the first site to provide a score view (Sibelius Scorch) of our 
    music (and still the only).</li>
  <li>We were the first site to include essays on relevant subjects related to 
    American popular music and sheet music.</li>
  <li>We are the most comprehensive and still offer the largest selection of songs 
    of any site that has followed us.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, our innovative site has spawned a multitude of imitator sites 
  that humble us with that sincerest form of complement. Our site has been linked 
  to by a number of academic institutions, the Library of Congress and some of 
  the major academic sheet music archive sites on the net. We are proud to have 
  been cited as an academic resource and to have some of our essays mentioned 
  as scholarly work. Several of our issues and essays are included in College 
  and University curricula related to music and American popular music. This recognition 
  is perhaps our greatest satisfaction as we set out to rise above the clutter 
  of the amateur midi sites and to establish a higher benchmark for American popular 
  music related sites. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, we're bragging and yes, we are quite proud of our accomplishments. Our 
  objective has always been to expand the knowledge base on the net for American 
  popular music and to provide information as well as entertainment. To celebrate 
  our five year anniversary and the beginning of our sixth year, this month we 
  offer you a retrospective of some of our most popular issues and some of our 
  own personal favorites. For this issue we have updated most of the music and 
  added lyrics and scorch versions for the songs that predated that format. We 
  hope you enjoy this little celebration and we hope for some of you, it helps 
  you discover areas of ParlorSongs you have not yet seen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come with us now in celebration of some of our most popular issues. If you 
  are new to ParlorSongs, we hope you find something to interest you. For our 
  loyal and long time fans, thank you for making us successful and we hope this 
  issue refreshes your memories of issues past.</p>

      Selected Song: <EM><b>Dear Heart</b></EM><b> </b>(1919)<br>
      Music by: W.C. Polla &amp; Willard Goldsmith<BR>
      Lyrics by: Jean LeFavre<BR>
      Cover artist: unknown<br>
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <P>Though not really one of our more popular issues, not even one of our 
        favorites, we must include our first <EM>surviving</EM> issue in this 
        special edition. In fact, this is not really the first edition. The first 
        edition was published in June of 1997 as a &quot;hobby&quot; page on <a href="http://www.geocities.com/TheTropics/4133/" target="_blank">Rick's 
        personal website</a>. He continued to publish monthly pages till Robert 
        joined him and we moved the site to its own domain and server. With Robert 
        adding much improved design and layout, (a process he has continued over 
        the last three years) the site was established as &quot;ParlorSongs.com&quot; 
        in 1998. Unfortunately, in the conversion process, the files for the real 
        first issues, from June - September were lost so we begin our documented 
        history and &quot;birthday&quot; with this issue.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><a href="/issues/1997-10/oct97feature.php" target="_blank">If you visit 
        this issue</a>, you can see just how far ParlorSongs has progressed over 
        the years. From a pretty amateurish and naive site, I've learned and together 
        we have progressed to what we are today. On that &quot;first&quot; issue 
        I introduced only five new songs (now we add 10-15 songs per month) and 
        included what was a regular feature till 2000, the &quot;gallery,&quot; 
        an un-narrated list of songs from prior months or with related themes. 
        The first few issues were not well developed as far as research or commentary 
        but early on I established the idea of &quot;themes&quot; for each issue 
        to focus on the unique aspects of American popular music. In some respects, 
        we're a little embarrassed by the rather humble beginnings of the early 
        issues but still retain them as an important part of the continuum of 
        our development and the information they bring to our overall site.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>The November, 1997 issue introduced the song <EM>Dear Heart</EM> as well 
        as 1892's <a href="/content/r/romping.mid"><EM>Romping Galop</EM></a>, 
        <a href="/content/b/bluejean.mid"><EM>Blue Jeans</EM></a> from 1920, <a href="/content/c/caromamy.mid"><EM>Carolina 
        Mammy</EM></a> from 1922 and <EM>Under The Moon</EM>, a 1927 novelty song. 
        Eight songs from the prior issues (lost) were included in the gallery. 
        (All links are MIDI versions, the 1927 song has been deleted due to copyright 
        concerns). This song sheet cover is in my opinion one of the most striking 
        portraits of a woman to be found anywhere, much less on music. The colors 
        are incredible and her eyes and face just captivate me. It has always 
        been my favorite and one that I believe epitomizes the artistry of sheet 
        music.</P>

      <H3>November, 1998</H3>
      <H3>&nbsp;</H3>
      <p>Selected Song: <EM><b>Alexander's Ragtime Band</b></EM> (1911)<br>
        Music by: Irving Berlin<BR>
        Lyrics by: Berlin<BR>
        Cover artist: unknown</p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>Of course Irving Berlin was one of America's greatest songwriters and 
        an icon of American popular music. Little did we know that in <a href="/issues/1998-11/nov98feature.php" target="_blank">November 
        of 1998</a> that our short and actually rather superficial biography and 
        feature on Berlin would become one of our most linked to and viewed features 
        of all time. Since it has become so popular, I've often intended to go 
        back and rewrite it, expand it and bring it up to current standards but 
        the pressure of monthly publishing continues to relegate the issue to 
        my &quot;round tuit&quot; list. 
      <p>&nbsp;
      <p>The selected feature song, <EM>Alexander's Ragtime Band</EM> was one 
        of Berlin's earliest and was the one song that propelled him to fame and 
        fortune. It's popularity was huge and it has remained popular ever since. 
        It is amazing that a song can endure for 100 years and still have relevance. 
        Many of Berlin's songs have remained in the public consciousness for decades 
        and that may well be why he ranks near the top (some the the very top) 
        of the American composer list. <a href="/issues/1998-11/nov98feature.php" target="_blank">Revisit 
        our Berlin feature page</a> to read a little more about him and experience 
        a few other of his songs. Of course we have featured scores of songs by 
        Berlin over the years and there will be more to come; he wrote hundreds.

      <h3>December, 1999</h3>
      <br>
      Selected Song: <EM><b>My Own Iona</b></EM><b> </b>(1916)<br>
      Music by: Anatol Friedland &amp; Carey Morgan<br>
      Lyrics by: L. Wolfe Gilbert<br>
      Cover artist: unknown 
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p> This issue is not necessarily one of <EM>your</EM> favorites, but is 
        one of Robert's and mine. We actually offered up two Hawaiian issues; 
        one in <a href="/issues/1998-12/dec98feature.php" target="_blank">December, 
        1998</a> and the one that included <EM>Iona</EM> in <a href="/issues/1999-12/dec99feature.php" target="_blank">December, 
        1999</a>. Robert has a great affinity for Hawaiian music, particularly 
        the Hawaiian guitar and ukulele. He has studied it's origins and has studied 
        its influence on and links to popular music, jazz and guitar playing technique. 
        Regardless, back in '98, I was searching for a theme for December (trying 
        to avoid the obvious and ennui inducing &quot;Christmas&quot; theme) and 
        Robert suggested Hawaiian music as Hawaii is a traditional destination 
        for travelers in December trying to escape both the weather and the rush 
        of that month. Voila, a salute to Hawaii. Though the '98 issue was pretty 
        OK, Robert came back the next year to write us a great issue that explored 
        the aspects of Hawaiian themed music to a greater extent. 
      <p>&nbsp;
      <p>Both of our Hawaiian issues have been quite popular and are linked to 
        by a number of Hawaiian guitar and music sites. This song happens to be 
        one of Robert's favorite &quot;Hawaiian&quot; songs, in his own words 
        from that issue: 
      <blockquote> <font size="-1">Now we come to my favorite song of the group. 
        <EM>My Own Iona</EM> (moi - one - ione) Billed on the cover as Hawaii's 
        favorite love song. Whether or not it was ever heard in Hawaii is up to 
        conjecture but it is a beautiful piece of music that evokes much of what 
        we expect to hear in Hawaiian music. I drove Rick crazy with this one. 
        The way I play it on the guitar, it sounds very vintage Hawaiian. The 
        way it is written sounds more like a march. Rick sequenced it as written, 
        which is our general procedure, I hated it. He did it again, I hated it. 
        He revoiced it, changed the tempo, transposed the melody by an octave, 
        finally he basically rewrote the entire piece. It sounds really good, 
        not what I hear when I read the sheet but good. This of course is part 
        of the big question about Hawaiian music. What is it really, do these 
        songs sound Hawaiian because they reflect the real music of Hawaii. Or 
        did Hawaiian music of the period evolve to meet the expectations of the 
        West. And is Hawaiian music the true progenitor of Modern Country Western 
        music, the Delta Blues and hence Rock and Roll? </font> </blockquote>

      <H3> January, 2000</H3>
      <BR>
      Selected Song: <EM><b>The Vagrants</b></EM> (1876)<br>
      Music by: Frank Van Duzer<BR>
      Cover artist: unknown<br>
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <P>By 2000, we had developed our format so that it was easier to navigate, 
        more pleasing visually and by then we also had much more to say. At the 
        same time, the &quot;gallery&quot; idea seemed to really add nothing except 
        more midi files and had seemed to have outlived its usefulness and relevance. 
        Given our objective of educating while entertaining, we dropped the gallery 
        as a feature and started to add what we called essays that were somehow 
        associated with the feature of the month. Our first feature-essay issue 
        in <a href="/issues/2000-1/2000-1.php" target="_blank">January of 2000</a> 
        was an immediate success and as Robert said in a follow-on addendum to 
        the essay:</P>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font size="-1">This months issue of Parlor Songs has already generated 
          more in depth reader feedback than any of our previous publications. 
          At first this surprised me considering that it is about one of the more 
          boring periods in American Popular Music and features some of our plainest 
          covers. But then I recalled that my initial response to Rick when he 
          mentioned the “Dead Zone” was to fire off a two thousand word stream 
          of conscious essay. Imagine my surprise when he included it as part 
          of this issue (mercifully removed before publication). However this 
          months theme has sparked such a strong chord with both us here at Parlor 
          Songs and with our visitors that we have decided to expand it into an 
          ongoing feature.</font> </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <P>The feature for January 2000 marked a major change on our direction and 
        offered some really interesting music from the early history of American 
        popular music before <a href="/insearch/tinpanalley/tinpanalley.php" target="_blank">Tin 
        Pan Alley</a> (another popular essay that is used in many academic settings 
        as a resource). This issue introduced our &quot;<a href="/insearch/insearch.php" target="_blank">In 
        search of&quot; series of special articles</a> that have since grown into 
        an acclaimed resource for many Universities and Colleges. This song, <EM>The 
        Vagrants</EM> was one of the more popular ones from the feature and continues 
        to be one of my personal favorites.</P>

        Selected Song: <b><EM>Red Wing </EM></b>(1907)<br>
        Music by: Kerry Mills<br>

      <p>By April of 2000, our feature and essay combination was going strong. 
        At the same time, the size of our issues was growing and the work required 
        to produce the monthly issues was almost becoming a full-time job. In 
        <a href="/issues/2000-4/2000-4.php" target="_blank">April, 2000</a> we 
        published an issue related to the stereotypes related to Native Americans 
        and music and coupled it with an essay that explored the realities of 
        <a href="/insearch/amerindian/amerindian0.php" target="_blank">Native 
        American music</a>. Again, we managed to find a combination of subject 
        matter and music that resonated with our readers and it has become one 
        of our most visited issue/essays. The following month, in May of 2000 
        we followed the essay up with one that explored the origins of &quot;<a href="/insearch/cowboys/cowboys.php" target="_blank">Cowboy 
        music</a>&quot; and had yet another popular issue on our hands. 
      <p>&nbsp;
      <p>The song <EM>Red Wing</EM> is one of our most popular published songs 
        and one we receive many comments on. The music is good, not great, but 
        it is the story and the cover that really sell this song. Again, we have 
        a cover that is absolutely stunning in it's use of color and subject. 
        The song seems to have played a big part in many people's lives and memories 
        and we still get many comments about it in our e-mail. Enjoy it again 
        now in the scorch format and see the lyrics with the link below.

        Selected Song: <b><EM>A Perfect Day</EM></b> (1910)<br>
        Music by: Carrie Jacobs-Bond<BR>

      <p>&nbsp; 
      <P>With our June, 2000 issue, we introduced a comprehensive composer biography 
        along with a feature about the composer's music. For those of you who 
        have followed ParlorSongs, you know that my (Rick) favorite composer of 
        all time is Carrie Jacobs-Bond. As I've said time and again, her music 
        and her spirit both speak to and captivate my soul. My wife dismisses 
        her as &quot;your dead girlfriend&quot; but I can't dump her that easily. 
        I've been consumed by her music and have collected a large number of her 
        original works. We've published many of her works but our <a href="/issues/2000-6/2000-6.php" target="_blank">feature 
        in June of 2000</a> and the accompanying in-depth<a href="/bios/cjbond/cjbond.php" target="_blank"> 
        biography of Carrie Jacobs-Bond </a>proved that I was not the only one 
        who loves her music. The issue continues to be one of the most visited 
        and I continually get e-mail feedback about the issue and other people's 
        love of her music. Her story is inspirational and her music is uplifting. 
      <P>&nbsp; 
      <P>The selected song, <EM>A Perfect Day</EM>, was Bond's personal greatest 
        hit. It sold millions and made Bond the first million selling female composer 
        in America. It is our best selling <a href="/storefront/shopping.php#scores" target="_blank">score 
        reprint</a> and is a song that is firmly embedded in the mind of our elder 
        generations. It is a beautiful yet simple song that shows Bond's mastery 
        of music and her lyrics' ability to speak to the heart.

      Selected Song: <b><EM>Over There</EM></b> (1918)<br>
      Music by: George M. Cohan<BR>
      Lyrics by: Cohan<BR>
      Cover artist: Norman Rockwell, <br>
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <P>In November of 2000, we began our biggest project of features and essays 
        with a three part series on Music in World War One that covered the periods 
        before, during and after the war. The series extended from November, 2000 
        with &quot;<a href="/issues/2000-11/2000-11.php" target="_blank">A Call 
        To Arms, Going to War</a>&quot;, then in December we presented <a href="/issues/2000-12/2000-12.php" target="_blank">part 
        2, &quot;Over There, Death, Destruction &amp; Ooo-La-La&quot;</a> and 
        the series ended in January, 2001 with <a href="/issues/2001-1/thismonth/feature.php" target="_blank">part 
        3, Coming Home</a>. 
      <P>&nbsp;
      <P>Each month had an accompanying essay beginning with &quot;<a href="/insearch/worldwar1/ww1no1.php" target="_blank">World 
        War One As Illustrated On Sheet Music&quot; </a>, moved on to &quot;<a href="/insearch/worldwar1-2/ww1no2.php" target="_blank">World 
        War One As Illustrated On Sheet Music, Part Two</a>&quot; and culminated 
        in the final essay with the original title, &quot;<a href="/insearch/worldwar1-3/ww1no3.php" target="_blank">World 
        War One As Illustrated On Sheet Music, Part Three</a>.&quot; If you are 
        a fan of war music or are interested in reading about some of the musical 
        aspects of the War, be sure to take the time to fully explore this series. 
      <P>&nbsp;
      <P>The selected song, <EM>Over There</EM> is one of the greatest wartime 
        songs ever written and one of the most recognized. The recently aquired 
        Rockwell cover is my most prized sheet music cover as Rockwell's work 
        only graced a handful of sheets. As such it represents a rare find as 
        well as true bit of American art and music combined. Of course the song 
        was published with a number of different covers and you can see a second 
        one in our collection when you &quot;mouse over&quot; the cover image 
        above.

      <P>The year 2000 was a busy one for us and one that resultd in a string 
        of popular issues and &quot;In Search Of&quot; articles. Early in the 
        year, in March, 2001 we published an issue that featured <a href="/issues/2001-3/thismonth/feature.php" target="_blank">songs 
        about boats and the sea</a> and coupled it with an <a href="/insearch/seasongs/shanties.php" target="_blank">article 
        about Sea Shanties</a> (Chantys, Chanties, Shantys, take your pick, all 
        seem to apply). While our main feature looked at songs related to boats 
        and the sea, our &quot;in search of&quot; article looked into the distant 
        past and the origins of work songs of the sea. The article has proved 
        to be a long term popular one and we had fun researching the subject and 
        creating the music.
      <P>&nbsp;
      <P>Our selected song is one of the many traditional shanties from the late 
        18th century - early 19th century period when sea shanties were quite 
        popular. It has a nice tune and humorous words, with was quite common 
        for these work songs. Making light of the difficulties of life at sea 
        helped cope with the privations and misery the tall ship sailors often 
        faced daily.
