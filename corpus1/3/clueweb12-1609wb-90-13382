					<p class="date"><span class="byline">Mar 8 2010 in <a href="http://pettradeworld.com/category/blog/" title="View all posts in News" rel="category tag">News</a> <em>by <a href="http://naidre" title="Visit naidre&#8217;s website" rel="external">naidre</a></em></span></p>

							<p>Voters in Switzerland have rejected a proposal to introduce a nationwide system of state-funded lawyers to represent animals in court.</p>
<p>Animal rights groups had proposed the move, saying that without lawyers to argue the animals&#8217; case, many instances of cruelty were going unpunished. </p>
<p>But the measure was rejected by around 70% of voters in a referendum. </p>
<p>Opponents had argued that Switzerland did not need more legislation. The government had opposed the idea.  Voters were almost certainly swayed by worries about how much such a system might cost taxpayers, and by objections from Switzerland&#8217;s farmers already struggling with reduced subsidies and falling milk prices. </p>
<p>Switzerland already has some of the strictest animal welfare legislation in the world. Pigs, budgies, goldfish and other social animals cannot be kept alone; horses and cows must have regular exercise outside in summer and winter; and dog owners have to take training courses to learn how to care for their pets. </p>

							<p>Dog lover, James Hewitt is planning to raise money for his local Dogs Trust rehoming centre by going for the ultimate walkies next month. In just 12 hours he will take a minimum of 100 resident rescue dogs for a one-on-one walk around the rehoming centre’s fields, covering a distance of at least 50km in just one day. </p>
<p>James, who works as a Canine Carer at Dogs Trust Darlington, will undertake the challenge on 13th April and is appealing for fellow dog lovers to sponsor him via his Justgiving page www.justgiving.com/James-Hewitt </p>
<p>James explains: “I’ve set myself this challenge for several reasons. I’m obviously a big dog lover and want to raise money for our canine residents, but I also want to highlight the fact that Dogs Trust Darlington has lots of volunteering opportunities, including dog walking. We would never ask people to cover 50km or walk 100 dogs in one day though!</p>
<p>My work at the centre is quite physical and I’m already responsible for walking around 20 dogs a day, but I’ve started training for the event and am stocking up on plasters for the big day.”</p>
<p>Dogs Trust Darlington cares for around 120 dogs at any one time. For more information on Dogs Trust, James’ challenge or if you are interested in volunteering please contact the centre at Hill House Farm, Sadberge, Co Durham, DL2 1SL or call 01325 333 114.</p>

							<p><strong>SafePets UK, founded by Debbie Connolly, has introduced a series of in store training sessions for pet shop staff.  </strong></p>
<p>Many pet owners use their local pet shops as a source of advice.  This advice can often be very good, but sometimes it isn’t and could be potentially dangerous. The <strong>SafePets UK</strong> training courses are designed to enable your staff to advise and help your customers safely. It is NOT a replacement for professional behaviour advice and assessments nor is it going to give staff the idea they are behaviourists.  It will pull together the mix of good, bad and old wives tales out there and offer something more uniform and professional that will add value to your business.</p>
<p>There are three levels of training &#8211; Bronze, Silver and Gold, which give everyone a chance to develop. The courses cover topics such as:<br />
•	Does food affect behaviour?<br />
•	What&#8217;s the best housetraining route?<br />
•	Is a headcollar or harness better?<br />
•	What&#8217;s the best toy to stop chewing?<br />
•	Can I stop spraying?<br />
•	What&#8217;s the difference in anti bark collars?<br />
In addition, some bespoke tailoring can be built into the courses around your best selling products or to promote poor selling lines.</p>
<p>Staff passing the course will each receive a certificate of their success and will be expected to sign and adhere to a Code of Conduct.</p>
<p><strong>Debbie Connolly</strong> is a well known animal behaviourist.  She is an Associate Member of the British Institute of Professional Dog Trainers and is the behaviour consultant for Zep the Dep Rottweiler Rescue and Bengal Cat Rescue. Training will therefore focus on dogs and cats and some livestock where appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Course Prices: </strong><br />
A day in store is £200 for the first staff member, £100 each for any additional staff trained on the same day.</p>
<p>A residential option is available which costs £250 for a day of training and an overnight stay.  For any additional member of staff added to the same course, the cost would be £100 each. </p>
<p>You will be asked to carry promotional literature in store to support the training courses and help your customers understand what you are offering. </p>
<p>You will need the permission of your store owner or manager if you wish to book a place on a course. For more details on the courses available telephone <strong>08712 317415</strong>, email <strong><a href="mailto:training@safepets.co.uk">training@safepets.co.uk</a> </strong> or visit <strong><a href="http://www.safepets.co.uk">www.safepets.co.uk</a></strong></p>

							<p>Dog-loving celebrities and sports personalities are giving their support to Puppy Farm Awareness Day which takes place this year on 19th September 2009. </p>
<p>This special day will help to educate the millions of people in the UK who are considering buying a puppy but are unsure who to contact and what to do next about purchasing one. </p>
<p>Located in remote areas of our British countryside, Puppy Farms mass-produce puppies which are usually removed from their mothers too early, transported around the country to dealers, and then sold from the internet, pet shops, free newspapers or even motorway service stations.</p>
<p>As a result these poor puppies are bought lacking socializing skills and commonly suffer from fatal health problems which can include pneumonia, parvovirus, as well as dangerous infestations of fleas and worms, often requiring hundreds of pounds of veterinary or behavioural treatment to fix. Breeding bitches are usually kept in cages or small pens, rarely see daylight or touch grass, and are mated on every heat; just fed enough to keep them producing pups, with little or no veterinary care at all.</p>
<p>The World’s Biggest Puppy Party invites all puppy owners to take part in a fun event whilst raising national awareness about such an important and serious animal welfare issue. This unique day will also feature a funky doggy shopping area, Scruffts cross-breed heats, assistance dog displays as well as an all-day celebrity-judged fun dog show open to dogs of all ages, with Ex-World Champion boxer Michael Watson MBE judging ‘Best Boxer Dog’!</p>
<p>The World’s Biggest Puppy Party is a non-profit dog-show held at Brighton Racecourse, Freshfield Road, Brighton, on 19th September 2009. Admission is a donation to be split between three charities: Hope Rescue, Sussex Pet Rescue and Pro Dogs Direct who rescue and rehabilitate ex-breeding bitches and stud-dogs. </p>

							<p>A rabies outbreak involving 10 human cases, has prompted authorities in China&#8217;s northwest Shaanxi Province to order a cull that has already seen as many as 30,000 dogs brutally slaughtered on the streets of Hanzhong and surrounding areas. This is one in 10 of the city&#8217;s dogs and numbers are rising. The authorities have blindly continued with the cull, despite receiving solid advice from International and Chinese experts that culls do nothing to eradicate rabies.</p>
<p>Despite best efforts, the dogs are still being brutally hunted down by gangs of men and women wielding bloody sticks, metal hooks and ropes, then heartlessly clubbed to death. Some of the killers are local men, ordered by the authorities to help in the slaughter. Others are taking part willingly, even laughing as they brutalise the dogs. Some are cherished family pets, while others are strays that have already suffered enough in their cruel, short lives on the streets.</p>
<p>The gutters are running with blood, rotting carcasses scatter streets and waterways, but it’s the hands of the Hanzhong authorities that are stained. The slaughtered dogs were on the streets only because these people still refuse to act on the evidence before their eyes – that the only way to manage stray-dog populations (and therefore rabies and other diseases) is to implement broad vaccination and trap, neuter, release (TNR) programmes.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, families have sobbed and fallen to their knees as their beloved dogs were snatched from their arms, roughly collared with rope and beaten to death before their eyes. Often the dogs wag their tails once or twice and look up pathetically between careless heavy blows to the face, head and spine. The dogs’ cries are spine-chilling.</p>
<p>Some animal lovers have formed an organisation to lobby their local authorities to adopt stray-dog management measures. Other municipalities are listening. Just last month, Animals Asia – along with other animal-welfare groups – was able to convince officials in Hehei, Heilongjiang Province to abandon a similar cull.</p>
<p>Dawn Hawkins of Scissal commented: “Animal Asia continue to do wonderful work in China and are passionate about what they are trying to achieve with the animals and people they are trying to help. Scissal has supported Animal Asia in the past and feel this is such a dire situation that needs urgent help to assist their vital TNR programmes”.</p>
<p>Dawn went onto say: “Animal Asia urgently need funds to equip local groups with the materials and information they need to convince their local governments to work with them to continue the Trap, Neuter, Release (TNR) programmes and I implore the worldwide pet trade to help in whatever way they can”. </p>

							<p>Now there’s a funny thing. Wouldn’t you just think that all companies would be falling over themselves for FREE publicity? Wrong. It never ceases to amaze us here at Pet Trade World, the number of companies who are conveniently unable to speak to a member of our editorial team! Let’s be honest here, whether we’re ringing for editorial help and advice or &#8211; heaven forbid &#8211; advertising, we are still offering to help promote a company in some way.</p>
<p>Remember that old adage &#8211; ALL publicity is good publicity? Perhaps some companies should bear it in mind when one of their products has been mentioned in a way they wouldn’t have chosen themselves, despite our numerous unanswered requests to them prior to publication!</p>
<p>And speaking of advertising &#8211; companies should also be aware that when they are placing their hard-earned advertising budget into the hands of large Advertising Agencies &#8211; that they are not necessarily paying commission for their expertise. At times, it is highly unlikely that a ‘Planner’ will be aware of ALL titles in the market, unless the titles have been around for at least 4 years and/or have an ABC (meaning that they are members of the Audit Bureau of Circulation). Many smaller ‘niche’ titles will probably never bother.  This invariably means that a ‘Planner’ may not actually be planning the most effective campaign at all. </p>
<p>If anyone is unsure about how to plan a campaign then anyone here will be pleased to help. After all, there is over 40 years publishing experience in our Publisher and Editor alone&#8230;&#8230;..that’s probably more than some agency planning departments employing 10 times that many! </p>

							<p>Only 18 months after its launch, Pet Trade World has announced a record distribution of 12,000 copies a month.</p>
<p>Pet Trade World was already the only digital magazine in the international pet trade and the new circulation increase now makes it the highest circulating title as well.</p>
<p>The magazines 12,000 circulation includes retailers, manufacturers, vets, kennels and catteries, garden centres, equine and aquatic related outlets and pet related organisations throughout the UK and the rest of the world. New requests for subscriptions continue to be received each month so the circulation is likely to continue growing for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The staff behind the digital magazine have had many years publishing experience across both consumer and Business to Business titles. Naidre Werner, Publishing Director of Pet Trade World, said: “Obviously we are delighted to have this level of circulation after only 18 months, but always knew it could be achievable with digital media. Digital magazines have been growing steadily for a number of years whereas everyone has been aware of falling circulations in printed consumer and business to business magazines for a long time. We decided to launch in a purely digital format mainly because the magazine would be available to a much wider international audience without the cost restrictions linked with using a printed magazine.”</p>
<p>She then went onto add: “This also enables us to keep our advertising costs low. In fact it gives us a cost per 1,000 lower than any other magazine in the market&#8230;&#8230;.even though we’re reaching a much larger audience!”</p>
<p>Claire Barks, Editor of Pet Trade World commented: “We may now be the highest circulating publication in the pet trade market but that doesn’t mean we’ll be resting on our laurels. Our aim was always to produce an innovative and informative title packed with up to the minute news and products and we will most certainly continue to do that. Because we have only been around for a relatively short period of time, there are also relationships to strengthen and build within the trade and that can only help improve our magazine product in the coming months.”</p>
<p>Pet Trade World is circulated monthly by personalised email to 32 countries throughout the world. Being a digital magazine allows PTW to use video and audio inserts and have live web and email links throughout &#8211; making it the only publication to offer readers an immediate call to action with any editorial coverage or advertising promotion.</p>
<p>Recent stats show that around half of the readers each month spend 20 minutes or more reading [on average] over 80% of the issue, and that the News and New Product sections are two of the most popular. Pet Trade World is of course the only truly environmentally friendly publication as it doesn’t use paper! Anyone within the pet trade interested in receiving a copy should email <a href="mailto:editor@pettradeworld.com">editor@pettradeworld.com</a> or  go to the ‘Subscribe’ section.</p>
