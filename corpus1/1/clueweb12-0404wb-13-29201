					<br>The tax reconciliation bill being negotiated between the House and Senate is reported to include the elimination of income limitations on Roth IRA contributions and the elimination of income limitations on Roth IRA conversions.   Under current law, the income limits to Roth IRA contributions are $4,000/$8,000 in 2006 and $5,000/$10,000 in 2010 for individuals and couples, respectively.  The proposal would also allow taxpayers to roll over traditional IRAs into Roth IRAs in 2010 regardless of their incomes and pay the tax in two installments in 2011 and 2012.  Under current law, taxpayers can only elect to convert their IRAs if their incomes are under $100,000, and there is no option to defer paying tax.   Taxpayers benefit from rolling over and paying tax now because all future gains are completely exempt from tax.  This table shows the distribution of benefits by income percentile for these provisions in 2006.
