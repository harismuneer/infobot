<br />
The first time we saw George, our beloved Great Dane, he was no more than a tiny, cowering ball of fuzzy fur.<br />
<br />
As my wife Christie opened the door of the crate he&#8217;d travelled in, he teetered to a standing position and looked out at us, moving his head slowly from side to side, taking in the wonder of it all.<br />
<br />
Finally, as if weighing us up and deciding we were acceptable, he tentatively pushed his little nose forward and gave Christie her first lick.<br />

<br />
<br />
Though it didn&#8217;t really register, George&#8217;s paws were comically large even then. But all we saw was this cute puppy.<br />
<br />
We certainly never dreamed he would one day become the biggest dog in the world, standing nearly 4ft high at the shoulder, 7ft long and weighing nearly 18 stone. Right now, he just looked bewildered.<br />
<br />
He came into our lives in January 2006, just a few months after we had married and set up home in Arizona. We both had busy jobs, Christie selling medical equipment while I was a property developer, but she had always planned that, once she had a house of her own, she would also have a dog. <br />
