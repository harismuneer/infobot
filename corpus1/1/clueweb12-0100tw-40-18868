In fact, according to the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (JACC), after diabetic patients drank specially formulated high-flavonoids cocoa for one month, blood vessel function went from severely impaired to normal.<br />

Good vascular function (how well blood vessels relax) helps prevent heart disease, high blood pressure and artery clogging. Chocolate's antioxidants (called procyanidins) relax vessels by increasing the chemical nitric oxide, according to new studies at the University of California, Davis.<br />

In my estimation, this opportunity is as close to perfection as one can imagine, with unique and exciting products that practically sell themselves to a huge &quot;chocoholic&quot; market. This product really works. People who take it regularly are having spectacular improvements in their health. Some of the benefits include better sleep, more energy, healthier and stronger teeth and gums, a decrease in the urge to overeat (thus managing weight), and the natural lowering of vascular hypertension.</p>

My blood sugar would drop so bad before I started on healthy chocolate, that I felt weak and needed to lie down all the time. Also chest pain has ceased! I can truly say that healthy chocolate products saved my life. Give it a try!</p>

I volunteer at a Family History Center as a Consultant were we have a candy dish for patrons and guests of which I have partaken many times.  To be honest, I would take 5 or more pieces at a time starting as soon as I would sign in.  Throughout my 5 hour shift, I would return to the dish for a refill about every hour&mdash;sometimes more often.</p>

                          <p class="style48">The candy dish isn't &quot;calling for me&quot; any more. I'm proud to say that in the last month I only had 5 pieces (not hands full) of candy. Even chocolate isn't a temptation.  A fellow worker gave me one of my favorite kinds of  candy bars.  I thanked him for it and put it in my backpack. A week later, while waiting for transportation at the airport, I remembered the chocolate left in my back pack. It didn't taste as &quot;good&quot; as I remembered it. I love my healthy chocolate.</p>

All I want to eat is dark chocolate.  I've been eating less (by cutting out the useless foods) and replacing it with chocolate.  Therefore, I don't crave the other foods like I used to.</p>

                            <p class="style48">When my husband and I started consuming the chocolate, my thoughts were simply, &quot;This stuff is delicious. If I can eat it three times a day and have no one fuss at me for eating too much chocolate, that's good enough for me.&quot;  Within days, my husband had his blood pressure checked. After being high for over 25 years (even with medication), it was down to normal and has remained so for this entire year. Within about a month, my husband, after replacing his regular breakfast with the healthy chocolate protein bar and eating a nugget before meals, noticed he was having to tighten his belt quite a bit.  He has lost about 35-40 pounds. </p>

                          <p class="style48">For myself, I did not notice any immediate results and I didn't expect it to help me in any way. After about a month, I noticed that my hair and skin looked better and I hadn't had a cold sore. This was saying something for me, considering I was used to having at least two or three a month. Now cold sores are rare and quick to leave. After about three months, I noticed I just felt &quot;good&quot; in general. I had been taking some form of an anti-depressant for about five years. I had researched dark chocolate and antioxidants and knew that there were some studies that said chocolate could also be a mood elevator, having anti-depressant properties.  I was able to reduce my level of medication and gradually stop taking it all together.  To this day I feel no need for any drugs to keep me from being depressed and it has been about 10 months since I stopped the medicine completely. </p>
                          <p class="style48">But the subtle benefits are sometimes the most impressive.  Adding the healthy chocolate to my diet has caused me not to crave as much junk food.  Instead I want more fruits and salads and choose yogurt for a snack rather than the fat- and sugar-laden chocolate pudding I would have chosen before. This chocolate satisfies my craving like no other chocolate can, and causes me to be more satisfied in all my food cravings.  And the longer I consume the chocolate the more I no longer notice a formerly tender joint. I am now convinced that the chocolate will only continue to improve my health and my life for as long as I continue to consume it.</p>

                            <p class="style48">I was diagnosed with diabetes a year and a half ago in February of 2006. I was 30 years old, mostly healthy, and was average weight with very little genetic history of the disease in my family, so the diagnosis came as a surprise. My original treatment regime consisted of 60 units of insulin in the morning and 1000 mg. of Metformin pills 2 times a day. Through my own personal diet I was able to reduce the insulin on my own to 30 units, but started to gain weight. In April of this year my weight was above 160 pounds, which was overweight for my 5' 8&quot; height. This was the month I was introduced to the healthy dark chocolate.</p>
                          <p class="style48">Within one week of starting it, I was able to cut my insulin down to 15 units. After one month I was able to reduce my Metformin to one pill per day and had started losing weight. After two months I was able to completely stop taking the Metformin and now, August 1, 2007, I have lost almost 20 pounds and am close to reaching my ideal weight! I feel better than I have felt in the last year and a half and I am excited to continue this path and beat this disease. I have also noticed a significant increase in energy, which I attribute also to my weight loss. My irritable bowel syndrome is gone, and, as long us my blood sugar levels are stable, my mood swings have also significantly reduced and I am not battling the depression issues I have in the past.</p>

                          <p class="style48">My husband, CJ, is also benefiting from eating the dark chocolate. He has lost close to 30 pounds. He has gone from taking up to 10 migraine medicines a day to 2. He has gone from not being able to be physically active at all (since before he had brain surgery three and a half years ago) to playing basketball twice a week, softball once a week, and jogging on his off days! My mom has benefited by her hot flashes being gone. My dad&rsquo;s high blood pressure dropped so low that he stopped eating the chocolate for a short time until he could speak with his doctor who has now suggested he keep eating the chocolate and reduce the amount of medication he is taking. The doctor is now looking in to purchasing the chocolate! </p>

                        <p align="justify" class="style17">Another new powerful antioxidant that can be blended in with  chocolate is the <strong>A&ccedil;ai berry</strong> from the Amazon. A&ccedil;ai has been touted as one of the superfoods of the world. It contains many phytonutrients. In fact New York Times best selling author <strong>Dr Perricone</strong> listed it on the <strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong> Show  as the <strong>number one superfood</strong> in the world. </p>

                        <p align="center" class="style17"><img src="images/perriconeacai.gif" width="327" height="202" /></p>
                        <p align="center" class="style194">Harvested from a special Amazon palm tree, A&ccedil;ai berries contain higher amounts of antioxidants than any other fruit.</p>
                        <p align="justify" class="style17"> A&ccedil;ai is a great source of anthocyanins, which again <strong>help protect the heart, prevent blood clots, relax the blood vessels, and has antiviral and antiallergenic properties. </strong>It has more than 30 times the amount of anthocyanins than red wine.</p>

                        <p align="justify" class="style17">The essential fatty acids in this berry (essential fatty acids are the ones required by our bodies to function that have to be provided by diet) include oleic acid (a monounsaturated omega-9 acid) and linoleic acid (polyunsaturated omega-6). <strong>These fatty acids help lower the (bad) LDL cholesterol oxidation, and maintain the (good) HDL cholesterol levels.</strong> </p>

  
                        <p align="justify" class="style17">This berry also has a protein profile like eggs (it contains all of the same amino acids) and is high in fiber, both of which are important for maintaining our health. It also <strong>has COX-2 inhibition and can limit generalized inflammation in the body</strong>. </p>

  
                      <p align="justify" class="style17">The berry is loaded with minerals like calcium, iron, magnesium and many trace minerals like chromium and copper. The a&ccedil;ai also contains naturally occurring B-vitamins, vitamin E, and vitamin C. It is related to saw palmetto, a natural remedy for prostate enlargement, and may also have the same action. The benefits of this berry are just starting to be realized.</p>

Fortunately, when eating unprocessed cocoa that uses low glycemic sugar, it takes very little chocolate to<strong> feel satisfied and obtain extremely high antioxidant levels. </strong></p>

As a coal miner who works 10-hour days, I have always been worried about my diet and overall health. I typically would eat snack cakes, cheese crackers and all types of candy just to get me through the day. Now I have a sandwich and healthy dark chocolate nuggets and don't crave the other, unhealthy foods anymore. I am thrilled about these products for my health.</p>

At the time, I had no idea what healthy chocolate was, or what it could do for our bodies.  I had a high heart rate for several years&mdash;95 to 115 beats per minute.  My wife would watch my pulse in my temple and tell me that my heart was going to explode someday.  We were visiting with my mother in June of 2007, and when my mother was checking her blood pressure and heart rate my wife asked me to check mine (I had not checked my heart rate since I had been on the chocolate). We checked my heart rate and it was 63.  We thought we did something wrong, so we checked it again.  It was 64 the second time we checked it. The only thing I have done is start taking healthy chocolate daily.  Still unsure, we checked my heart rate again when visiting with my mom a month later, it was 68.  My wife and I are excited.  We now have a product that we can depend on to help maintain our health.  Thanks for this wonderful product.</p>

Due to the bp and cholesterol meds I have to visit the doctor every 6 months and it just so happens I will see him in Oct so if this keeps up I&rsquo;m going to ask him to lower my dosage from 40mg to 20mg and let&rsquo;s see what happens. </p>

                  <p align="justify" class="style17">&ldquo;Patients with type 2 diabetes can certainly find ways to fit chocolate into a healthy lifestyle.  Research focuses on what&rsquo;s at the true heart of the discussion on &ldquo;healthy chocolate&rdquo;&mdash;it&rsquo;s about cocoa flavonoids, the naturally occurring compounds in cocoa,&rdquo; Dr. Kelm said. &ldquo;While more research is needed, our results demonstrate that dietary flavonoids might have an important impact as part of a healthy diet in the prevention of cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients.&rdquo; </p>

                  <p align="justify" class="style17">Umberto Campia, M.D., who co-wrote an editorial about the new study in the same issue of JACC, noted that diabetics are an ideal population in which to study the effects of flavonoids on arterial function, because high blood sugar damages the endothelium and because these patients have a high risk of cardiovascular disease. </p>

                                <p class="style48">Being an insulin-dependent diabetic has made it challenging to control my blood sugar even though I have an insulin infusion pump that continuously administers insulin. I am also allergic to chocolate... or so I thought until I tried a healthy chocolate beverage with acai! I am happy to say that I am NOT allergic to the pure cocoa used in this beverage, and I am enjoying it daily with taste and health benefits I never thought possible.</p>

                              <p class="style48">Today I am using less insulin with incredible blood sugar control, even when I eat the chocolate with acai nuggets as opposed to drinking the beverage. When I am feeling stressed, overtired or hungry between meals, I have a nugget or a one-ounce serving of the chocolate acai beverage. Literally within a few minutes I feel more relaxed with sharper focus and better concentration to handle the task at hand. The swings of high and low blood sugars cause poor concentration and focus, which sometimes makes it extremely difficult to read or complete tasks. These swings can also cause aches and pains and poor circulation. As long as I take at least three ounces of the chocolate and acai beverage each day, I do not experience the aches and pains that were waking me in the middle of the night.</p>

                              <p class="style48">I am looking forward to a lifetime of great health with deliciously healthy chocolate in spite of the fact that I am a diabetic! My husband also enjoys healthy chocolate with acai at least three times a day. He has replaced glucosamine and other antioxidant products he was using for aching legs and knees and has discovered incredible results of his own. We are indeed headed for a happy retirement while sharing this product with others so that they may experience great health of their own.</p>

We feel better and are not as depressed or aggravated as we were.  Not only did we gain more energy, but we have been loosing weight which we thought would never come off.

A couple years back I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia; I received various treatments for many years. My muscles didn't work like they were supposed to, and I had blinding headaches four times a week. Pain medication did help, but that brought on its own set of problems. Chronic pain takes it toll, and at times it was unbearable. I found out how easy it would be to become addicted to pain medication, and at times I probably would have done anything to make the pain go away for just ten minutes. Thankfully, I was never tempted by more than what I could stand. I also have arthritic joints. They aren't terrible but painful enough that I climb the stairs slowly and have to make sure that I have a tight grip before I pick something up.</p>

                              <p class="style48">Ever since I started to take a wonderful chocolate drink with acai, I noticed a real change. Then the real surprise came. After three weeks I didn't have any more headaches. I would wake up each morning and expect the usual wave of pain that I would experience when I moved my head each morning. When it did not happen, I almost cried tears of gratitude. Yes, I still do have the occasional headache. But with all that I have been through, I can deal with that. And believe it or not, I now run up and down the stairs without pain. All this is possible with just three ounces of this ultimate antioxidant beverage each day.</p>

                                <p class="style48">I suffered with chronic pain in my right knee for two years prior to taking an antioxidant beverage with chocolate and acai. There were times that I would have to wear a knee brace because it was really painful and miserable. Within three hours of taking the chocolate beverage, the pain in my knee vanished. The inflammation was also gone within a three-hour period. I had never experienced anything like this before with any of the other products or companies that I had been with. I was impressed.</p>

                              <p class="style48">Chocolate is probably the most complex perfect food on earth. It has extremely high antioxidant value and works synergistically with other antioxidants. The combination of ingredients found in this beverage is the best we can get.</p>

                                <p class="style48">In October 2005 I was at work when I fell to the ground and lost my speech. I was rushed to ER, where staff did an MRI, a CT scan, and a spinal tap.  Blood gushed out of the spinal tap so I was immediately taken to UC Davis Medical Center.  I was diagnosed with an inoperable aneurysm in my brain, plus a VAD that caused severe stabbing pain.  Brain fog has been a problem since that incident.  I returned to work, struggled with my memory, and in June 2006 I underwent lower back surgery due to a blown disk.  The medical doctors told me I have permanent nerve damage, but when I started with the chocolate a month ago, my brain fog lifted, my bladder improved, I sleep all night long now, and my right leg is not as numb anymore.  The high quality of antioxidants in healthy chocolate have helped to restore the nerves in my leg and I feel hope again.   I have also lost 11 pounds and my complexion has improved.  Knowing that the chocolate is helping me, gives me incredible confidence as I enthusiastically recommend it to everyone!</p>

Just six short months ago, I would have never guessed my flexibility would have returned.  I have an auto immune disorder which in the past meant achy, inflamed joints and cranky emotions.  I was a mess.  I tried to block the pain, and the exhaustion of pretending to feel good was wearing on me and those who live with me.   I used only things from nature to block the pain, which was helpful, but the remedies did not address the inflammation.   I was always feverish and not too much fun to be around.<br />
                                    <br />

                                  I do not go far without my healthy chocolate drink.  If I go just one day without it, my symptoms present themselves again.  Thank GARSH it is chocolate and it tastes wonderful! Chocolate Cheers,</p>

My doctor said that I can either learn to live with the pain or take pain pills.  Since you can't drive a truck and take pain meds, I learned to live with it until the weekend.  A friend of mine had me take a small healthy chocolate nugget.  He told me it may help my shoulder pain.  About three hours after taking this, my shoulder stopped hurting.  I ran out of the chocolate after two days and my shoulder started hurting again the next day.  I did this three times on and off, on and off, on and off.  I am off all my pain meds now.  I will not be off this healthy chocolate again.  By the way, I have lost 40 pounds since Feb 26, 2007.  This chocolate gives you so much energy you do not get tired. </p>

I decided to give the chocolate a try so I started drinking a healthy chocolate drink twice a day and a healthy chocolate nugget or bar in between, depending on my needs or mood.  It not only worked, but I completely went off of the medications when I started eating the chocolate and I feel fantastic.  I ran out of the healthy chocolate drink and found the inflammation and pain coming back, so I immediately ordered more.  Now I find that as long as I use the chocolate regularly I have none of the problems associated with RA. Wow, what a relief. </p>

Unfortunately, on the way to a workout I was hit by a car while riding my motorcycle.  That accident crushed my right foot and laid me up for about six months. </p>

                              <p class="style48">At the time of the accident I weighed about 160 lbs.  By the time I rolled out of bed six months later I was at 265 lbs and extremely depressed.  I have struggled with my weight and depression ever since.  The trauma to my foot was such that I was incapable of exercise.  Any sustained pressure or activity would cause my foot to swell to twice its normal size.  I lived on ibuprofen to control the pain and swelling and started the diet process to control my weight. </p>

                              <p class="style48">I have lost over 1200 lbs. dieting over the past 20 years, unfortunately due to the &ldquo;yo-yo&rdquo; effect I gained over 1400 lbs. during the same time period.  I finally maxed out at 375 lbs and I quit trying. </p>

                              <p class="style48">When I was introduced to Healthy Chocolate I was very skeptical.  I only started taking it on a challenge from a friend.  My results were dramatic.  In my first week of Healthy Chocolate 20 years of chronic pain in my foot seemed to melt away.  I have not taken an ibuprofen in almost a year now.  In addition to the pain being gone I lost 38 lbs in my first month.  My sense of well being was such that I found myself wanting to live again.  I now exercise regularly, I find I crave healthy foods as opposed to the junk I used to &ldquo;live&rdquo; on and I have lost 85 lbs. to date.  I still have a long way to go, but it is wonderful having a product that gives me the ability to make it there.  I am eternally grateful to my friend and their persistence in getting me to try Healthy Chocolate!</p>

I stained my back fence by hand two weeks ago-20 panels-and it is exciting to be able to DO so much more, and enjoy the sense of well-being besides. Let's hear it for healthy chocolate!</p>

                                <p class="style48">When I was 16 I went on a horseback trip in the Uintah mountains. The horse got spooked and I was bucked off and landed on a rock, shattering portions of my vertebra. We were 26 miles in with no chance to get other help, so the other members of the group made a travois and drug me out on it. It took three days. I haven't slept a full night through since then, and that was ten years ago. I started taking five ounces daily of a chocolate antioxidant beverage with acai and within four days slept the whole night through! In fact, I was late to work for my first time in five years. I don't have an alarm because I always wake up long before it is time to leave because I can't sleep. I have since had to buy an alarm, because I sleep every night, all night.</p>

                                <p class="style48">I have suffered from severe allergies for 14 years. In fact, I tried immunotherapy (allergy shots once a week for five years) with limited results. I was taking multiple allergy pills a day and the side effects were debilitating (drowsiness and dryness). It was a daily balancing act that I hated.</p>

                              <p class="style48">I have had four corneal transplants and more than a dozen subsequent reparative eye surgeries over the last 10 years due to complications with a corneal disease. Having severe allergies and an eye disease definitely do not mix. My allergies attack the weakest parts of my body: my eyes. If you have had corneal transplants, rubbing your eyes is not a good idea because of the sutures that still remain. The pain and discomfort is torture. The steroids I put in my eyes several times daily do not necessarily help control the symptoms. The only real solution was complete avoidance of the elements.</p>

                              <p class="style48">Since I started drinking healthy dark chocolate with acai, I have not taken an allergy pill or had an allergy attack. I can breathe and function normally most days. My eyes are not suffering, and for some unexplained reason my vision is getting better. I do not have joint pain like I used to. The only thing I have done differently is consume these potent antioxidants.</p>

                                <p class="style48">Since childhood I have been allergic to most green things that grow in the ground. For me, breathing through my nose feels like I'm forcing the air through a mass of wet concrete. I fight for every molecule of air. With this comes frequent sinus headaches. Allergy shots did nothing. Pills mostly alleviate my symptoms but have side effects that are often worse than the original problem. Even moving to the dry desert didn't help. My story was featured in a 1999 Associated Press article about allergies in the Tucson Desert. I learned to live with the chronic congestion and pain of sinus cavities that are 15 percent open at best.</p>

                              <p class="style48">All of this changed after I started drinking a chocolate antioxidant beverage for a couple of weeks. One day I noticed that I could breathe in through my nose deeply, without a struggle. The congestion was virtually gone. My sinuses felt light and open. To make sure this wasn't my imagination, I stopped drinking the beverage for about four days. Sure enough, back came the &quot;concrete-filled&quot; feeling. So I went back to drinking healthy chocolate with acai. I no longer need to pop decongestants to breathe and painkillers to deal with my frequent sinus headaches.</p>

When I got to Utah I had a miserable time dealing with allergies; red and itchy eyes, execema, stuffed sinus etc. I went and saw a local allergy specialist who told me I was allergic to every tree type, grass type and pollen type in Utah. He put me on allergy shots at $25.00 per week and my allergies got a little better. It wasn't until I started taking healthy chocolate that I noticed a real difference and within 2 weeks I stopped my allergy shots. These healthy chocolate products have allowed me to enjoy Utah without having anymore allergy problems.</p>
