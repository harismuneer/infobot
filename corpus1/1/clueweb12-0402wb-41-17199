	<h1>						Income tax, then and now			</h1>
<p>
<p class="textitalic"><i>By Michael Cadesky  +  Peter Weissman<br />Illustration: Blair Kelly</i></p><p><b>A quick review of the past four decades of the tax system proves it’s a complex Canadian tax world</b></p><p class="text"><img alt="" src="http://www.camagazine.com/images/2011/june/camagazine49981.jpg" style=" float: left;" />It has been almost 40 years since Canada overhauled its tax system, eliminating estate duties and bringing in capital gains tax. Since 1972, we have seen no less than 49 editions of the Income Tax Act.<br /><br />Its length has increased enormously and the complexity exponentially. Changes in technology have aided the Canada Revenue Agency in the selection and audit of taxpayers. Ever-changing legislation, powerful audit tools, information exchange agreements and antiavoidance rules have made tax planning harder, tax compliance more challenging and tax enforcement easier with key changes over the past 40 years and challenges presented to the accounting profession.</p><p><b>Personal tax rates</b><br />In 1972, the top personal tax rate was close to 70%, when taxable income reached $60,000. Today, the combined top personal tax rate is between 39% and 48% (depending on the province) when taxable income reaches about $128,000. While the top personal tax rate has decreased noticeably, the expansion of the tax brackets has been far below inflation.<br /><br />The first meaningful reduction in tax rates occurred with the 1981 federal budget. The objective was to broaden the tax base and lower personal tax rates. In 1987 tax rates were again lowered and the tax base was broadened further, along with the conversion of tax deductions to tax credits. We moved from higher rates and a smaller tax base to lower rates and a broader tax base.</p><p><b>Corporate tax rates</b><br />Corporate tax rates have changed just as dramatically as personal tax rates. In 1972 the top corporate tax rate was about 52%. When the latest reductions come into effect in January 2012, Canada will have a combined federal and provincial corporate tax rate of about 25% (depending on the province) and will no longer be seen as a high-tax place to do business. Canada’s corporate tax rates are now lower than those in the US. With corporate rates this low, CAs will have to revise decades-old strategies.</p><p><b>Small business</b><br />Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPC) have always enjoyed a preferred tax rate on active business income. The differential between the high corporate tax rate and the small business rate in 1972 was about 25%. Today it is only 10%. Compensating for this is the dramatic increase in the annual income eligible for the small business rate. Originally $50,000, it is now $500,000.</p><p><b>Dividends and capital gains</b><br />The preference for dividends or capital gains has gone back and forth over the past 40 years. We have seen capital gains lose ground to dividends as the capital gains inclusion rate increased to 662/3% from 50% in 1988, and then in 1990 to 75%. When reduced to a 50% inclusion rate in 2000, capital gains regained favour. Even with the eligible dividend system that evolved out of the income trust era, capital gains are still preferred in most provinces.<br /><br />This issue has far-reaching consequences, extending even to post-mortem planning strategies.</p><p><b>Capital gains exemption</b><br />It is hard to think of a change in the past 40 years with more impact on small business tax planning than the capital gains exemption. Now at $750,000 per individual, the capital gains exemption is worth about $170,000 of tax savings. Ensuring clients can access this significant benefit has resulted in CAs having to turn simple CCPC structures into more complicated but optimal structures that need to be closely monitored.</p><p><b>Owner-manager remuneration</b><br />Until recently, three guiding principles governed the basic philosophy of owner-manager remuneration in Canada. <br /><br />Pay salary and bonus to eliminate high-rate income, leave low-rate income in the corporation (to defer tax) and, if additional personal funds are required, pay dividends.<br /><br />With the dramatic reduction in corporate tax rates and the eligible dividend system, it is becoming more common to retain high-rate income in a corporation as an alternative to bonuses. This dramatic shift in philosophy for owner-managed business, previously unthinkable, is caused by the stark differential between the top personal tax rate and the general corporate tax rate. If the tax rates do not drop as expected, we will be revisiting this issue.</p><p><b>Scientific research and experimental development program</b><br />The SR&amp;ED tax credit program is a cornerstone of the Canadian tax system and one of the best incentive programs in the world, but it is somewhat unpredictable. Issues regarding the program’s administration are under review and hopefully this incentive remains an element to drive innovation in Canada.<br /><br /><b>Tax deferrals<br /></b>There is an old adage that tax deferred is tax saved. This has not escaped the watchful eye of the government, and many changes have been enacted to prevent tax deferral.<br /><br />For CAs advising owner-managed businesses, the first attack on tax deferral came with amendments to the rules on unpaid remuneration. In the past, it was permissible to accrue a bonus at year-end and pay the bonus one year later, so deferring personal tax. This advantage was eliminated in 1986, resulting in the current rule that remuneration be paid within 180 days of year-end, failing which it is not deductible until paid. Because 180 days is less than six months, the due date always falls before the date for filing the corporate tax return.<br /><br />The next change occurred in 1995 and affected not only clients but also CAs. It provided that a partnership with an individual (or a professional corporation) as a partner report income on a calendar-year basis. The March 2011 federal budget proposed to eliminate the deferral from all partnership structures. Even though the budget was defeated, it is expected these particular proposals will ultimately become law as proposed.<br /><br />Other changes have been more subtle. The government of Canada records its tax revenue on a cash basis when preparing the accounts of the nation. Its year-end is March 31. In a move designed to create a one-time increase in tax revenues, the date for remittance of personal tax instalments was changed from month-end to the 15th. This gave enough time to bank the March tax instalment before the government’s year-end.</p><p><b>Antiavoidance rules<br /></b>A striking feature of today’s Income Tax Act is the number of antiavoidance provisions, many adapted from other jurisdictions, most notably the US. Most stem from a tax plan that became popular, and ultimately too popular.<br /><br />Antiavoidance rules target tax shelters, restrict capital cost allowance, bring about at-risk and limited recourse financing restrictions and deny donations. We have seen antiavoidance rules directed at income splitting, first with a general cleanup of the rules in 1985 and, more recently, the kiddie tax that applies to interest and dividends in respect of closely held companies. The March 2011 federal budget proposes to extend these rules to certain capital gains.<br /><br />If one had to pick the most significant tax case of the past 40 years, arguably it would be the Stubart Investments Ltd. (1984 DTC 6305) case where the Supreme Court held that there is no requirement under the Income Tax Act for a transaction to have a business purpose. Provided the transaction is legally effective, its form will govern, absent specific legislation to the contrary. The afterglow of Stubart was short-lived, with the implementation of the general antiavoidance rule (GAAR) in 1988. We advised clients, anxiously, for 17 years until the Supreme Court clarified how GAAR was to be interpreted. We now practise in a world where tax avoidance is permissible provided it is not abusive. The CRA has not enjoyed the success it had hoped for in applying GAAR, particularly where international tax treaties are involved.<br /><br />Now GAAR must be addressed in tax planning even when all technical tax provisions have been complied with.</p><p><b>International area<br /></b>We have witnessed an explosion of legislation in the international area, which began in earnest when CRA lost the Canada Trustco case in 1995. This case opened the door to structuring active businesses offshore and stuffing them with investment income earned tax free. This opportunity was closed down rapidly with amendments to the foreign accrual property income rules, forming the basis of what we have today. We are faced with lingering uncertainty in international planning. Proposed amendments to the tax rules for foreign affiliates and nonresident trusts have been out there for a decade but have not become law. The rules are so complicated that the Senate exercised its seldom-used authority to refer the proposals back to Parliament for reconsideration.<br /><br />If successful, the recent Garron and Antle decisions will modify the law regarding the residence of trusts, which has been accepted since the Thibodeau Trust case in 1978.</p><p><b>Tax litigation<br /></b>The past four decades have seen a dramatic increase in tax litigation due to various factors including taxpayers becoming more litigious and/or more aggressive; the CRA becoming more unreasonable and/or refusing to settle cases; and the increasing complexity of the Income Tax Act. Whatever the reason, it is clear that tax litigation is a blossoming business. Lawyers handling tax litigation cases place heavy reliance on a support team that often includes CAs who know a client’s history intimately.</p><p><b>Compliance explosion<br /></b>In 1972 the corporate income tax return was relatively simple. It had to be: it was prepared by hand. The starting point was the corporation’s audited financial statements. Today, the corporate tax return is a voluminous series of schedules, condensed into a barcode or filed electronically. Changes have been significant, but the most monumental is the starting point. Fixed format (or GIFI) financial statements are now used based on the corporation’s internally generated figures, instead of external financial statements produced by CAs. Recently proposed aggressive tax planning rules will require that the CRA be informed of tax plans that meet certain criteria. Preparer penalties now exist that can penalize advisers in certain circumstances.<br /><br />In the international area, much additional reporting is necessary. Foreign reporting forms disclose information concerning foreign affiliates, the T106 discloses transactions with foreign related parties, and there is a requirement for contemporaneous transfer pricing documentation. This contributes greatly to the cost and complexity of tax compliance and places responsibility on CAs to ensure the necessary information and filings are done.<br /><br /><b>Tax administration<br /></b>The CRA’s audit actions have increased steadily over the past four decades. The increased compliance requirements noted above resulted in even more taxpayer information going to the CRA. With computer technology, electronically filed personal and corporate tax returns and better taxpayer identification processes, the CRA is able to run larger and broader special projects. Decisions of Canadian courts, including the Supreme Court, have confirmed the CRA’s broad authority to require organizations to provide information related to unnamed third parties. For example, eBay, Amex Bank, The Redeemer Foundation and the Montreal Real Estate Board were all required to provide the CRA with information regarding their members.<br /><br />Electronic searches are greatly aiding the CRA, which has been known to demand access to e-mails and other virtual in-formation. Analyzing ratios based on electronically filed GIFI information to identify audit targets has started at the CRA. Expect the trend for more international cooperation, information sharing and even joint auditing among tax authorities to continue.<br /><br />This combination of access to large amounts of information and computer sorting techniques has resulted in a proliferation of special projects. Gone are the 1990s-style special projects such as audits of car expenses, hairdressers, restaurants or interest expense. Now projects range from the kiddie tax project of 2008 to complex and costly mass audits such as those of trusts and high-net-worth individuals.<br /><br />Taxpayers now have the taxpayer relief measures and certain declared taxpayers’ rights that can assist in dealing with the CRA.</p><p><b>What’s next<br /></b>In charting a course for the future, one would be misadvised to use the signposts of the past as a guide. It is unlikely that corporate tax rates will fall further, and it is equally unlikely that personal income tax rates will drop by much. Capital gains will most likely continue to be 50% taxable, and dividends from Canadian corporations will still enjoy preferential treatment. It seems the capital gains exemption is here to stay.<br /><br />Entrepreneurial business will continue to enjoy tax advantages, given its importance to the Canadian economy.<br /><br />Tax avoidance will be dealt with harshly and swiftly by legislation and aggressive audit activity by the CRA. CAs will have to be careful to avoid assuming clients’ tax liabilities as a result of preparer penalties, the aggressive tax planning rules and poor documentation or advice, leading to litigation by clients.<br /><br />What is as sure as death and taxes is that the income tax world will continue to become more complex and that scrutiny by the CRA will increase. CAs must continue to invest in education to update their tax knowledge. Those practising in the tax advisory area will continue to live in challenging and exciting times.</p><hr /><p class="text"><i>Michael Cadesky, FCA, FTIHK, TEP, and Peter Weissman, CA, TEP, are partners with Cadesky and Associates LLP in Toronto<br /><br />Technical editor: Jay Hutchison, tax managing partner, Canada, E&amp;Y</i></p>
