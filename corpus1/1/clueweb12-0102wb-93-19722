						<p><strong>by Greg Petty<br />
July 2009</strong></p>
<p>We are fortunate to live in a state  that played a critical role in many of our nation’s defining events.  North Carolina always could be counted on to come to the aid of her  sister state Virginia, the home of Washington, Jefferson, Madison,  Monroe and Robert E. Lee. North Carolina’s official state account of the  service rendered to the Confederate States of America <em>Tar Heels: Five Points in the Record of North Carolina</em> claimed and proved her troops were &#8220;First at Bethel, farthest to the  front at Gettysburg and Chickamauga, and last an Appomattox.&#8221;</p>
<p>North Carolina contributed 128,191 troops to the war and  accounted for one-ninth of all troops. Because her troops were  well-respected and proven fighters, North Carolinians participated in  almost all of the war’s definitive battles. As a result she suffered  40,635 casualties (dead or wounded) and more than one-quarter of all the  CSA battlefield deaths.</p>

<p>The Civil War is the definitive period of American history and  the following tour takes advantage of our location to visit battle sites  in both states crucial to the war and its ending. America lost 620,000  lives — more than almost all our other war casualties combined. The war  has so shaped our national consciousness, economic, political, racial  and social life that it has entered the realm of mythology. Its legacies  are many including the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments, the elevation of  Lincoln to one of our greatest Presidents and a legend, and sadly, the  delay caused by Reconstruction to uphold the principles for which so  much precious blood was shed.</p>
<p>This driving tour close to home is designed to take the traveler  to Civil War sites in southern and central Virginia that end up in  Durham. Along the way we will visit important museums, battlefield sites  crucial to the conclusion of the war and visits to Madison and  Jefferson’s homes. There are also a few pleasant diversions along the  way so all you non-Civil War buffs take heart and come along for the  ride. I did this trip in three days but that is because I have  previously visited some of the battlefield sites along the way. To take  advantage of a full tour I would plan on about five or six days.</p>
<p>Our first stop is just south of Petersburg, VA so take I-85 north  to exit 63A just south of Petersburg to the Pamplin Historical Park. It  is home to The National Museum of the Civil War Soldier. It is built on  422 acres that belonged to the founder Robert B. Pamplin ancestors  during the Civil War. Mr. Pamplin’s foundation is responsible for saving  the site of Grant’s breakthrough of Lee’s defensive line at Petersburg  that caused him to flee westward and for Richmond to be vacated by  Jefferson Davis and his cabinet.</p>

<p>In addition to the battlefield, the Pamplin offers two museums,  antebellum homes, a slave life exhibit, costumed living history  demonstrations, educational programs and the Civil War Adventure Camp  where you can spend a daytime or overnight living the authentic life of a  soldier. What a great way to make the war come alive for you and your  grandchildren. Don’t miss the live firing demonstration. The  presenter/actors are all authentically dressed and explain in detail the  process of their battle tactics which were shaped by the loading,  firing and accuracy of the rifles in their possession. I also recommend  seeing the interactive exhibit Duty Called Me Here: The Common Soldier’s  Experience in the Civil War. You select a soldier (Of course I chose a  Tar Heel) and follow him throughout the exhibit. At the end you learn  the fate of your soldier. Other recommended exhibits are the Slave House  and accompanying film, and the photography exhibit at the Battlefield  Center. For directions and more info visit <a href="http://www.pamplinpark.org/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.pamplinpark.org']);" target="_blank">pamplinpark.org</a> or call 877.726.7546.</p>
<p>If you have not visited the Crater Battlefield at Petersburg make  that your next destination. If you have, head into Richmond to the  American Civil War Center at Historic Tredegar. This museum is on the  site of the Tredegar Gun Foundry and  does a superb job of incorporating  state of the art interactive displays, timelines, artifacts and maps  from the beginning to the end of the war. It is arranged by years and  its special mission is to tell the whole story of each side in an  even-handed way but also incorporates the African-American perspective.  Its moniker is In The Cause of Liberty and it is very instructive.  Speaking of instructive, the museum has an active calendar of events and  hosts many school groups to provide them information and understanding  of the war’s impact on our society. The museum is located at 500  Tredegar St. Go to the site at <a href="http://www.tredegar.org/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.tredegar.org']);" target="_blank">tredegar.org</a> or call 804.780.1865. While you are here, go next door to the National  Park Service Visitor Center at Tredegar to learn about the foundry,  Richmond’s pivotal role in the war and area battlefields.</p>
<p>Other Richmond sites are the Museum of the Confederacy containing  the largest collection of Civil War artifacts in the world, Monument  Avenue and the Virginia Capital designed by Jefferson. If you are ready  for some outdoor activity, go a short way north on I-95 to the  Mechanicsville Pike and head toward Cold Harbor. Lee’s army came here  after Spotsylvania to keep Grant from crossing the James River and  preventing a siege (which later took place at Petersburg). They beat the  Union forces there and assumed commanding positions. The resultant  disastrous Union assault proved as costly as the horrific charge at  Marye’s Hill in Fredericksburg.</p>

<p>Continue north on 1-95 to Fredericksburg, VA. It played a crucial  role in the war as it was halfway between Washington and Richmond. It  was also a prize because it had the Rappahannock River and the railroad,  both crucial to supplying any army trying to either protect or capture  Richmond. The battles fought within 20 miles of its borders claimed  100,000 casualties (killed or wounded), making it the bloodiest  landscape in America.Many thanks to Karen Hedelt at The Department of  Tourism, City of Fredericksburg for getting me organized to make the  most of my time in the area. The good folks at Homewood Suites just off  Carl Silver Parkway provided me gracious accommodations because  Fredericksburg would be the center of sightseeing for the next two or  three days. Homewood Suites at 1040 Hospitality Lane is a great location  because it is close to Hwy 3 that will be your conduit to both downtown  Fredericksburg and The Wilderness to the west.</p>
<p>Fredericksburg is famous on its own for the disastrous Union  assault by Burnside on Marye’s Heights, the Sunken Road and  street-to-street fighting in December of 1862. It was only supposed to  be a diversionary attack but cost 8,000 Union troops. Other battlefields  to visit here are Chancellorsville, The Wilderness and Spotsylvania.</p>
<p>Head to downtown and go to the Visitors Center at 706 Caroline  Street. Pick up the walking tour pamphlets and get the Handbook of  Historic Fredericksburg. The tour will take you through the battle and  all of the historic structures in the town. You can easily spend the  entire day between the tour and the Visitor Center at Fredericksburg  National Cemetery and Battlefield. Be sure to see the movie and take the  tour of the Sunken Road and Wall below Marye’s Heights. If you arrive  early as I did, tour the cemetery and the monuments there.</p>
<p>If someone in your family needs a break from the war sites they  can easily stay downtown and go to the delightful antique stores, art  galleries and boutiques. Have them keep the Handbook so they can read  about all the historic buildings they will pass. If you want a quick  lunch and a cold beer about midday stop into The Rec Center at 213  William St. It is a lively local restaurant, pool and music hall. If you  stay until the evening and desire an exceptional meal, I suggest La  Petite Auberge at 311 William St. The Renault family at La Petite serves  French cuisine and cocktails in a delightful environment. The food,  where possible, is locally grown and the service is excellent.</p>
<p>The next part of the trip includes visits to The Wilderness and  Spotsylvania. 1864 was the year that spelled the demise of the  Confederacy, and it was for a couple of main reasons. The Union had  changed its battle tactics with Sherman’s objective being the  destruction of the South’s ability to support a war machine and Grant’s  single-minded determination to keep Meade on Lee’s trail everywhere he  went to reduce his army and rob it from re-supplying itself — And of  course, the North’s capacity to produce and provision war materiel to  its army. The battles of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania were really the  last great efforts of Lee’s army to keep itself from being besieged and  its movements restricted.</p>
<p>Head west on Highway 3 to Hwy 20 (The Constitution Highway) and  follow the signs to the Wilderness Battlefield Exhibit Shelter. Pick up  the brochure and take the tour. The battle here at Saunders Field shows  you the confusion, lack of communication and chaos a battle can cause  resulting in horrible casualties. Follow the numbered battle signs in  your car and stop to read each marker. The last stop leaves you at Brock  Road (Hwy 613), turn right and follow it a little over six miles to  Spotsylvania. Stop at the Exhibit Shelter to get the map and go to the  third stop, the Bloody Angle. The tour guide will explain the terrific  battle and heroics that took place here, and you do need the guide to  understand how the battle evolved.</p>
<p>The next to the last battle site on the tour will be Appomattox;  take the Constitution Highway (Hwy 20) straight south down the Piedmont  of Virginia. It is a breathtaking drive and is among some of the most  scenic places I have visited in America.</p>
<p>Along the way are Montpelier and Monticello, homes of friends  James Madison and Thomas Jefferson respectively. I recommend the tour of  both properties and you can intersperse it with a tour of some of  Virginia’s finest vineyards. Before you leave on this trip visit monticellowinetrail.com/sections/winetrails.html and plan out your own itinerary. Monticello is impressive for both the  home and grounds itself but also the newly completed Visitors Center and  Smith Education Center. For more info go to <a href="http://www.montpelier.org" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.montpelier.org']);" target="_blank">montpelier.org</a> and <a href="http://www.monticello.org/" onclick="javascript:_gaq.push(['_trackEvent','outbound-article','http://www.monticello.org']);" target="_blank">monticello.org.</a></p>
<p>Take Highway 24 south to Appomattox. After the siege breakthrough  at Petersburg Lee was forced to take his remaining army (about 25,00  men) west and south to try to meet up with Joe Johnston’s troops here in  North Carolina facing Sherman. He became trapped and realized that he  was facing over 100,000 Union troops and had few provisions or food left  to fight them with. On April 9, 1865 he surrendered to Grant at the  McLean House at Appomattox Courthouse. The Park Service has done a  superb job of reconstructing the Village so take your time to see the  site. The first act of Grant was to send for food provisions to feed the  Confederates and to instruct his troops not to cheer as these men were  now our countrymen again.</p>
<p>Take Hwy 47 to its intersection with I-85 and head home to  Durham. The last stop will be Bennett Place the site of Joseph E.  Johnston’s surrender to Sherman, nchistoricsites.org/bennett. After the  defeat at Bentonville, Johnston made his headquarters in Greensboro and  conferred there with Jefferson Davis. Johnston’s troops skirmished with  Sherman all the way from Raleigh across Cary (then named Jones),  Morrisville and Carpenter at Petty Farm Road and to Moringsville where  the road to Hillsborough crossed New Hope Creek.</p>
<p>After hearing the news of Lee’s surrender and Lincoln’s  assassination, Johnston knew he could not hold out against a determined  Union army under Sherman. After three meetings he surrendered his 89,270  troops on April 26, 1865. This was the largest Confederate surrender  but not the last. The final surrender would come at New Orleans on May  26, 1865. Johnston later honored his nemesis Sherman by being an  honorary pallbearer at his funeral at the age of 82. When warned by a  friend to wear a hat because of the extreme New York City cold, he  refused as it would be a sign of disrespect. He died of pneumonia ten  days later.</p>
<p>I hope you too will consider taking this beautiful and  informative trip through American history and enjoy all of these  national treasures in our midst.</p>
