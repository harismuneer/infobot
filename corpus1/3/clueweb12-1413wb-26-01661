Nice, that is, until it's time to fill out your federal income tax return. At that point, you may be left scratching your head. Just how do you report your investments and how are they taxed?</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Is it ordinary income or a capital gain?</span></strong></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">To determine how an investment vehicle is taxed in a given year, first ask yourself what went on with the investment that year. Did it generate income, such as interest? If so, the income is probably considered ordinary. Did you sell the investment? If so, a capital gain or loss is probably involved. (Certain investments can generate both ordinary income and capital gain income, but we won't get into that here.)</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">If you receive dividend income, it may be taxed either as ordinary income or capital gain income. Under the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 and the Tax Increase Prevention and Reconciliation Act of 2005, dividends paid to an individual shareholder from a domestic corporation or qualified foreign corporation are generally taxed at the same rates that apply to long-term capital gains. These rates are 15 percent for an individual in a marginal tax rate bracket that is greater than 15 percent or 0 percent (in 2008-2010) for an individual in the 10 or 15 percent marginal tax rate bracket. But special rules and exclusions apply, and some dividends (such as those from money market mutual funds) continue to be treated as ordinary income.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The distinction between ordinary income and capital gain income is important because different tax rates may apply and different reporting procedures may be involved. Here are some of the things you need to know.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Categorizing your ordinary income</span></strong></div><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Investments often produce ordinary income. Examples of ordinary income include interest and rent. Many investments--including savings accounts, certificates of deposit, money market accounts, annuities, bonds, and some preferred stock--can generate ordinary income. Ordinary income is taxed at ordinary (as opposed to capital gains) tax rates.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">But not all ordinary income is taxable--and even if it is taxable, it may not be taxed immediately. If you receive ordinary income, you must categorize it as taxable, tax exempt, or tax deferred.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><span>&middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Taxable income: This is income that's not tax exempt or tax deferred. If you receive ordinary taxable income from your investments, you'll report it on your federal income tax return. In some cases, you may have to detail your investments and income on Schedule B.</span></p><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><span>&middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Tax-exempt income: This is income that's free from federal and/or state income tax, depending on the type of investment vehicle and the state of issue. Municipal bonds and U.S. securities are typical examples of investments that generate tax-exempt income.</span></p><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><span>&middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Tax-deferred income: This is income whose taxation is postponed until the future. For example, with a 401(k) retirement plan, earnings are reinvested and taxed only when you take money out of the plan. The income earned in the 401(k) plan is tax deferred.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">A quick word about ordinary losses: It's possible for an investment to generate an ordinary loss, rather than ordinary income. In general, ordinary losses reduce ordinary income.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Understanding what basis means</span></strong></div><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Let's move on to what happens when you sell an investment vehicle. Before getting into capital gains and losses, though, you need to understand an important term--basis. Generally speaking, basis refers to the amount of your investment in an asset. To calculate the capital gain or loss when you sell or exchange an asset, you must know how to determine both your initial basis and adjusted basis in the asset.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">First, initial basis. Usually, your initial basis equals your cost--what you paid for the asset. For example, if you purchased one share of stock for $10,000, your initial basis in the stock is $10,000. However, your initial basis can differ from the cost if you did not purchase an asset but rather received it as a gift or inheritance, or in a tax-free exchange.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Next, adjusted basis. Your initial basis in an asset can increase or decrease over time in certain circumstances. For example, if you buy a house for $100,000, your initial basis in the house will be $100,000. If you later improve your home by installing a $5,000 deck, your adjusted basis in the house may be $105,000. You should be aware of which items increase the basis of your asset, and which items decrease the basis of your asset. See IRS Publication 551 for details.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><div><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Calculating your capital gain or loss</span></strong></div><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">If you sell stocks, bonds, or other capital assets, you'll end up with a capital gain or loss. Special capital gains tax rates may apply. These rates may be lower than ordinary income tax rates.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Basically, capital gain (or loss) equals the amount that you realize on the sale of your asset (i.e., the amount of cash and/or the value of any property you receive) less your adjusted basis in the asset. If you sell an asset for more than your adjusted basis in the asset, you'll have a capital gain. For example, assume you had an adjusted basis in stock of $10,000. If you sell the stock for $15,000, your capital gain will be $5,000. If you sell an asset for less than your adjusted basis in the asset, you'll have a capital loss. For example, assume you had an adjusted basis in stock of $10,000. If you sell the stock for $8,000, your capital loss will be $2,000.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Schedule D of your income tax return is where you'll calculate your short-term and long-term capital gains and losses, and figure the tax due, if any. You'll need to know not only your adjusted basis and the amount realized from each sale, but also your holding period, your marginal income tax bracket, and the type of asset(s) involved. See IRS Publication 544 for details.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><span>&middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Holding period: Generally, the holding period refers to how long you owned an asset. A capital gain is classified as short term if the asset was held for a year or less, and long term if the asset was held for more than one year. The tax rates applied to long-term capital gain income are generally lower than those applied to short-term capital gain income. Short-term capital gains are taxed at the same rate as your ordinary income.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><span>&middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Marginal income tax bracket: Marginal income tax brackets are expressed by their marginal tax rate (e.g., 15 percent, 25 percent). Your marginal tax bracket depends on your filing status and the level of your taxable income. When you sell an asset, the capital gains tax rate that applies to the gain will depend on your marginal income tax bracket. Generally, a 0 percent long-term capital gains tax rate applies to individuals in the 10 or 15 percent tax bracket (in 2008-2010), while the long-term capital gains of individuals in the other tax brackets are subject to a 15 percent rate.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p style="MARGIN-LEFT: 0.5in; TEXT-INDENT: -0.25in"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt"><span>&middot;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Type of asset: The type of asset that you sell will dictate the capital gain rate that applies, and possibly the steps that you should take to calculate the capital gain (or loss). For instance, the sale of an antique is taxed at the maximum tax rate of 28 percent even if you held the antique for more than 12 months.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Using capital losses to reduce your tax liability</span></strong></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">You can use capital losses from one investment to reduce the capital gains from other investments. You can also use a capital loss against up to $3,000 of ordinary income this year ($1,500 for married persons filing separately). Losses not used this year can offset future capital gains. Schedule D of your federal income tax return can lead you through this process.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><div><strong>&nbsp;</strong></div><p><strong><span style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt">Getting help when things get too complicated</span></strong></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">The sale of some assets are more difficult to calculate and report than others, so you may need to consult an IRS publication or other tax references to properly calculate your capital gain or loss. Also, remember that you can always seek the assistance of an accountant or other tax professional.</span></p><div>&nbsp;</div><p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt">Neither Forefield Inc. nor Forefield Advisor provides legal, taxation, or investment advice.
