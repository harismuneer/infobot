before the English arrived. They established a fort in 1562, as did the Spanish

arrived in the colony of Carolina in 1670 and established a town at Albemarle 
Point on the west bank of the Ashley River. The settlement, named Charles Town 
in honor of King Charles II of England, was subsequently moved a few miles away 
to a peninsula between the Ashley and Cooper rivers. Charles Town (renamed 
Charleston in 1783) was the political, social, and economic center of South 
Carolina throughout the colonial and antebellum periods, and it served as the 
state capital until 1790. Charleston District was formed in 1769, but portions 
were later split off to form Colleton (1800) and Berkeley (1882) counties. 
Present day Charleston County includes the old parishes of St. Philip, St. 
Michael, Christ Church, St. Andrew, St. John Colleton, and part of St. James 
Santee. English and French Huguenot settlers and their African slaves built 
indigo, rice, and cotton plantations along the area's rivers and on its sea 
islands, while merchants of many nationalities made Charleston one of the 
busiest ports on the Atlantic. During the Revolutionary War the American forces 
defeated the attacking British fleet at Charleston in June 1776; a palmetto log

Spanish explorers are believed to have visited this coastal area in 1526, but no 
permanent settlement was established. English planters and their African slaves 
moved into the region in the early eighteenth century, building large rice and 
indigo plantations. The town of Georgetown, which was established around 1730, 
was a busy port serving the surrounding plantations. Georgetown District was 
first named in 1769, encompassing the parishes of Prince George, All Saints, and 
Prince Frederick. In 1785 the district was divided into four counties: Liberty 
(which became Marion District in 1800), Kingston (which became Horry District in 
1801), Williamsburg (which became a separate district in 1804), and Winyah 
(which was renamed Georgetown in 1800). During the Revolutionary War the troops

Swiss, and Scotch-Irish immigrants moved into the area and established small

growth of Columbia across the Congaree led to Granby's decline, and the county 
seat was moved to the town of Lexington in 1818. Several Revolutionary War
