<!--ZOOMRESTART--> <h2>Summary</h2>  <p>Supporters of the dividend and capital gains tax cuts, which were enacted    in 2003 and are slated to expire at the end of 2008, have started a full-court    press extolling the virtues of these provisions.&nbsp; This effort is aimed at    building support for proposals Congress is expected to consider in coming    months to extend these provisions, most likely without offsetting their costs.&nbsp;    Proponents of these tax cuts have pointed in particular to recent    developments, including the findings of several studies and the decision by    Microsoft to initiate dividends, that they claim provide evidence that the    dividend tax cut is having a major impact on corporate dividend policies and    will lead to substantial economic gains.&nbsp; In this vein, the President&rsquo;s    Council on Economic Advisers contends that the response to this tax cut &ldquo;has    been unprecedented in the recent history of tax changes.&rdquo;</p>  <p>A closer review of the available evidence, however, indicates that the    supporters of the dividend and capital gains tax cuts tend to overstate the    positive effects of these tax cuts and ignore their negative effects.</p>  <ul>      <li>Although current research shows that some companies initiated or      increased dividends following enactment of the dividend tax cut, the      findings also indicate that some corporate dividend policies may be      ineffective at achieving the economic and corporate governance improvements      that the tax cut&rsquo;s supporters assert will result from increased dividend      payouts.</li>      <li>The high cost of the dividend and capital gains tax cuts    continues to add to the deficit, and the resulting increase in deficits has    negative long-term economic consequences.&nbsp; Economists at the Congressional    Research Service and the Brookings Institution, for example, have concluded    that the adverse effects of the increased deficits cancels out, and may even    outweigh, any positive effects from these tax cuts themselves.</li>      <li>Further, while there may be open questions about the economic    impact of the dividend and capital gains tax cuts, there is no question that    the benefits of these tax cuts flow overwhelmingly to those with the highest    incomes.&nbsp; The   <st1:place xmlns:st1="urn:x-prefix:st1"><st1:placename>Urban</st1:placename><st1:placename>Institute-Brookings</st1:placename><st1:placename>Institution</st1:placename><st1:personname><st1:placename>Tax</st1:placename></st1:personname><st1:placename>Policy</st1:placename><st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place> estimates that more than half &mdash;      53 percent &mdash; of the benefits of these tax cuts in 2005 will go to the 0.2    percent of households with incomes over $1 million.&nbsp; More than three-quarters of    the benefits in 2005 will go to the 3.3 percent of households making more than    $200,000.</li>  </ul>  <h3>Corporate Dividend Policies After the Tax Cut Not Always Consistent With Objective of Improved Corporate Governance and Economic Efficiency</h3>  <p>Supporters of the tax cut on dividend income maintain that the tax cut is    needed to address economic distortions that arise from the &ldquo;double taxation&rdquo;    of dividend income, which can be taxed at both the corporate and shareholder    levels.&nbsp; While the extent of such &ldquo;double taxation&rdquo; is often overstated by    tax-cut supporters, the theory is that reducing &ldquo;double taxation&rdquo; of dividends    will reduce distortions that can deter investment in the corporate sector,    cause corporations to rely too heavily on debt financing and to become saddled    with high interest payments, and encourage firms to maintain high cash balance    levels that may be put to poor uses such as perks for company executives.&nbsp;    Reducing such distortions could yield gains for the economy, although by most    estimates, the gains would be fairly modest.&nbsp; In theory, a tax cut that    resulted in a sustained increase in dividend payments would be a sign that    some of these distortions in the economy were being addressed.</p>  <p>Aggregate    data on the level of dividend payments in the one-year period after the    dividend and capital gains tax cuts were enacted in 2003 yield few insights    into what effect these tax cuts actually are having on corporate dividend    payments.&nbsp; To study this question, researchers have had to parse the data more    finely.&nbsp; Several studies have concluded that some companies have increased    dividends or started to pay new dividends in response to the tax cut.&nbsp; There    is some evidence that factors other than the tax cut also may have influenced    the extent of the changes.&nbsp; But at least three findings imply that the impact    of these changes may be smaller than tax-cut supporters acknowledge.</p>  <ul>      <li>Not all of the new dividends are in the form of ordinary    dividends paid on a regular basis.&nbsp; Rather, a portion of the dividend payouts    are coming in the form of one-time, special dividends.<a href="#_ftn2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>&nbsp;    Unlike a regular dividend that commits the company to future payouts, these    one-time payouts give no indication of a company&rsquo;s future plans.&nbsp; The one-time    nature of special dividends mitigates the positive effects that regular    dividends are believed to yield in terms of improved corporate governance and    economic efficiency over the long run.</li>      <li>Questions have been raised as to whether companies that have introduced or    increased dividends actually are increasing their total payout to    shareholders.&nbsp; The concern is that companies may be substituting dividend    payments for share repurchases, an alternative method of payout that boosts    the price of the company&rsquo;s stock for shareholders (see box on page 8).&nbsp;    Without a total increase in payout, the economic gains from increasing    dividends are diminished.&nbsp; The extent to which companies are substituting    dividends for repurchases is not clear, because the data are difficult to    interpret.&nbsp; According to a study by economists from the National Bureau of    Economic Research and the Federal Reserve Bank, for instance, about half of    the companies that have introduced or increased dividends have <em>not</em>    increased their total payout to shareholders.<a href="#_ftn3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a>&nbsp;    Another NBER study, however, did not find evidence of such substitution, but    could not rule out the possibility that some may have occurred.<a href="#_ftn4" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a></li>      <li>Finally, several studies found that the companies mostly likely    to respond to the tax cut by initiating or increasing dividends are those in    which top executives hold substantial shares in the company and thus stand to    benefit personally from the change in dividend policy.<a href="#_ftn5" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a>&nbsp;    Corporate managers should change dividend policies consistent with the best    interest of the company and its shareholders.&nbsp; When managers act out of    self-interest, there is no guarantee that the actions will be aligned with the    broader interests of the company or the shareholders.&nbsp; Whether a firm    initiates dividends should be a function of what is most productive for the    firm, not the size of the shareholdings of the firm&rsquo;s top executives.</li>  </ul>  <div class="textBox">  <h4>Using the Budget          &ldquo;Reconciliation&rdquo; Process to Extend Tax Cuts</h4>  <p>The Administration&rsquo;s          budget calls for making permanent most of the tax cuts enacted during          its first term that are slated to expire by the end of 2010, including          the capital gains and dividend tax cuts that expire at the end of 2008.&nbsp;          The budget resolutions currently being considered in the House and          Senate also assume that these expiring tax cuts are extended.&nbsp; The House          budget assumes tax cuts totaling $106 billion between 2006 and 2010,          while the Senate resolution would reduce revenues by $70 billion over          this five-year period.</p>  <p>Moreover, these          budget resolutions include special &ldquo;reconciliation&rdquo; instructions to the          tax writing committees &mdash; the House Ways and Means Committee and the          Senate Finance Committee.&nbsp; Reconciliation is a fast-track process for          considering legislation that is protected from a filibuster in the          Senate. &nbsp;In the Senate, these instructions cover all of the tax cuts          assumed in the resolution, while in the House they cover $45 billion of          the tax-cut total.&nbsp; The resolutions and the reconciliation instructions          in the House and Senate measure would accommodate the $23 billion cost          between 2006 and 2010 of extending the capital gains and dividend tax          cuts.</p>  <p>The reconciliation          process was originally designed as a way to provide procedural          protections to deficit-reduction measures in order to facilitate their          passage, given the difficulties that legislation cutting spending or          raising taxes can face.&nbsp; In 2001 and 2003, however, reconciliation was          used to <em>cut </em>taxes.&nbsp; For this year&rsquo;s budget, Congressional leaders          again appear determined to use the procedural protections that the          reconciliation process provides to aid the passage of tax cuts that          increase, rather than decrease, the deficit &mdash; a complete reversal of the          way that reconciliation was originally used.&nbsp; Further, these tax cuts          are being pursued in the context of budget that seeks significant          reductions in domestic spending in the name of deficit reduction.&nbsp; While          these program cuts will affect millions of Americans, the benefits of          the tax cuts &mdash; and particularly the capital gains and dividends tax cuts          &mdash; will flow primarily to those with the highest incomes.</p>  </div>  <p>Supporters of the dividend tax cut will likely argue that any shortcomings in    the nature of the response to the tax cut is a reflection of the fact that the    tax cut is set to expire in 2008, and that companies would respond differently    if it were made permanent.&nbsp; That seems improbable, however.&nbsp; Typically, the    response to a tax cut perceived as temporary would be stronger, not weaker, as    taxpayers rush to take advantage of the tax cut before it expires.&nbsp; Further,    arguments that corporations have avoided initiating or increasing dividends    because they may be forced to reverse this change if the tax cut expires seem    unfounded.&nbsp; Although corporations that reduce dividends typically fear they    will be penalized by investors, who may perceive the change as a sign of    financial weakness, it is hard to believe that investors would react    negatively if a company reduced dividend payments in response to the    expiration of the tax cut.</p>  <p>Over the    long run, factors besides the tax cut are likely to be more influential than    the dividend tax rate in shaping corporate dividend policies.&nbsp; Economic    research has generally found that the tax rate a company&rsquo;s shareholders face    when they receive a dividend payment is not the most important determinant of    a company&rsquo;s decision about whether to pay dividends.&nbsp; Studies indicate that    the tax rates that shareholders pay on dividend income ranks well below other    factors that executives consider, such as the stability of the company&rsquo;s    future earnings, when making dividend decisions.&nbsp; A recent study based on a    survey of corporate executives concluded that &ldquo;increases in dividends are    considered only after investment and liquidity needs are met&rdquo; and that &ldquo;tax    considerations are not a dominant factor in their decision about whether to    pay dividends, to increase dividends, or in their choice between payout in the    form of [share] repurchases or dividends.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn6" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a></p>  <h3>The Tax Cut&rsquo;s High Cost Will Mitigate Any Positive Effects on the Economy Over the Long Run</h3>  <p>Even if    the dividend and capital gains tax cuts were to generate meaningful economic    benefits, such effects would be mitigated as long as the high cost of this tax    policy adds significantly to the deficit.&nbsp; As the federal government borrows    to finance the deficit, it shrinks the pool of saving available for    investment, ultimately leading to lower future incomes for Americans (see box    on page 10).&nbsp; As a result, analyses by economists at the Congressional    Research Service and the Brookings Institution have concluded that the    dividend and capital gains tax cuts, which are being financed by increased    borrowing, are unlikely to boost the economy in the long run.&nbsp;</p>  <ul>      <li>The Joint Committee on   <st1:personname xmlns:st1="urn:x-prefix:st1">Tax</st1:personname>ation estimates that the dividend and    capital gains tax cuts, which are scheduled to be in effect through 2008, will    cost $148 billion.&nbsp; Making these tax cuts permanent would reduce revenues by    an additional $148 billion through 2015, according to Congressional   <st1:personname xmlns:st1="urn:x-prefix:st1">Budget</st1:personname> Office estimates.&nbsp; Because this      lost revenue increases the deficit, an additional $110 billion in costs will      be incurred through 2015 for higher interest payments on the debt.&nbsp; In      total, these tax cuts, if extended, thus would add $405 billion to the debt      from the time they were enacted in 2003 through 2015.</li>      <li>The large cost of these tax cuts is crucial for understanding    their impact on the economy.&nbsp; Supporters of the tax cuts often refer to    Treasury Department estimates generated for a 1992 report that examined    options to cut dividend taxes.&nbsp; In that report, the Treasury estimated that    these options &mdash; all of which cut dividend taxes more substantially than the    2003 change &mdash; could generate slightly higher economic growth.<a href="#_ftn7" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a>&nbsp;   <em>But all of these Treasury estimates assumed that the tax cuts would be    fully offset and would not increase the deficit.</em></li>      <li>The Congressional Research Service analyzed the 2003 tax cut    under a number of assumptions and concluded that, if made permanent, it &ldquo;would    harm long-run growth as long as it is based on deficit finance.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn8" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a>&nbsp;    Similarly, Brookings Institution economists   <st1:personname xmlns:st1="urn:x-prefix:st1">William Gale</st1:personname> and   <st1:personname xmlns:st1="urn:x-prefix:st1">Peter Orszag</st1:personname> concluded that even if the more    optimistic assumptions about the positive effects of the dividend and capital    gains tax cuts on the economy proved accurate, as long as these tax cuts    continued adding to the deficit, &ldquo;the net effects would be roughly a zero    effect on long-term growth.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn9" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a></li>  </ul>  <h3><strong>Benefits of the Tax Cuts Skewed to High-Income Households</strong></h3>  <p>While the    effect of these tax cuts on corporate dividend policies may be subject to    different interpretations, what is clear is that the benefits of these tax    cuts flow overwhelmingly to households with the highest incomes.</p>  <ul>      <li>In 2005, some 53 percent of the benefits of the dividend and capital gains tax    cuts will flow to the 0.2 percent of households with incomes of over $1    million, according to an analysis by the   <st1:place xmlns:st1="urn:x-prefix:st1"><st1:placename>Urban</st1:placename><st1:placename>Institute-Brookings</st1:placename><st1:placename>Institution</st1:placename><st1:placename><st1:personname>Tax</st1:personname></st1:placename><st1:placename>Policy</st1:placename><st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>.&nbsp; These households will    receive an average tax cut of $37,962 in 2005.&nbsp; These tax-cut benefits are in    addition to the generous benefits such high-income households are receiving    from the other tax cuts enacted since 2001.</li>      <li>Households with incomes over $200,000 will receive      more than three-quarters of the dividend and capital gains tax-cut benefits; those with    incomes above $100,000 will receive 90 percent of the benefits.&nbsp; Only 10    percent of the benefits of the dividend and capital gains tax cuts will flow    to the 86 percent of households with income under $100,000 in 2005.</li>      <li>Supporters of the tax cuts may try to argue that the benefits    are more widespread, pointing to the growing number of families that own    stocks.&nbsp; Despite this growth, however, stock ownership remains highly    concentrated at the top of the income spectrum.&nbsp; Moreover, high-income    households are much more likely to hold stocks in<em> taxable </em>accounts than    middle-income families, who hold a larger share of their savings in retirement    accounts that are not subject to tax.&nbsp; Data from the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s      2001 Survey    of Consumer Finance show that households in the top five percent of the income    spectrum own about half of all stocks and nearly 60 percent of all stocks held    in taxable accounts.&nbsp; Only stocks owned in taxable accounts receive a direct    benefit from these tax cuts.</li>  </ul>  <p align="center"><span class="imgWrapperLeft" style=" width:354px;"><img  class="frame"  border="0" src="http://www.cbpp.org/images/cms/3-10-05tax-f1.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="269" /><span class="small"></span></span></p>  <p>The remainder of    this analysis is divided into three sections.&nbsp; The first section reviews the    economic issues raised by the dividend and capital gains tax cuts.&nbsp; The second    section reviews the academic research undertaken to assess the impact of the    tax cut on corporate dividend policies.&nbsp; The final section examines which    households benefit from the dividend and capital gains tax cuts.</p>  <h2>Economic Issues Surrounding the Dividend and    Capital Gains Tax Cuts</h2>  <p>Supporters of the    dividend and capital gains tax cuts enacted in 2003 argue that these tax cuts    address problems with the taxation of corporate earnings and thus can have a    positive impact on the economy, particularly if they are made permanent.&nbsp; Such    claims, however, typically ignore the adverse economic effects these tax cuts    will have over the long term if they lead to higher deficits.&nbsp; Taking into    account the negative impact of budget deficits on future national income is    crucial to understanding the long-term effects of tax cuts financed by    borrowing.</p>  <h3>Taxation of Corporate Earnings</h3>  <p>Supporters of the    dividend and capital gains tax cuts maintain that this tax relief is needed    because the earnings of public corporations are taxed twice.&nbsp; This so-called    &ldquo;double taxation&rdquo; occurs because, in theory, corporate earnings are first    subject to the corporate income tax, and these after-tax earnings are then    taxed again at the individual level when the company&rsquo;s shareholders receive a    dividend payment or sell shares that have appreciated in value.&nbsp; Prior to the    enactment of the dividend and capital gains rate cuts in 2003, the extent of    this &ldquo;double taxation&rdquo; was greater for dividends than for long-term capital    gains; dividends faced individual marginal rates of up to 38.6 percent, while    capital gains faced a top rate of 20 percent.<a href="#_ftn10" id="_ftnref10">[10]</a>&nbsp;    The 2003 tax cut lowered the top rate for both dividends and long-term capital    gains to 15 percent, substantially reducing the tax on this type of income at    the individual level.</p>  <p>Those who support    these tax cuts maintain that &ldquo;double taxation&rdquo; results in higher tax rates for    corporations and therefore may distort investment decisions in the economy.&nbsp;    When promoting the President&rsquo;s dividend tax cut proposal in 2003, the    President&rsquo;s Council of Economic Advisers maintained that double taxation of    corporate income can affect economic decisions in ways that &ldquo;may reduce    corporate investment, encourage artificially high debt-to-equity ratios,    discourage the payment of dividends, and favor noncorporate organizational    forms.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn11" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a></p>  <p>The CEA    contends, for instance, that a high tax burden on dividends deters firms from    paying dividends to shareholders and that this has the effect of favoring    investments in those established businesses that generate a steady cash flow    and are able to retain earnings to fund future investments.&nbsp; Distributing    these earnings through dividend payments, in contrast, would create the    opportunity for the funds to be invested in other firms that may have the    potential to grow faster, which would be more beneficial for the general    economy.&nbsp; The CEA also argued that the payment of dividends can improve    corporate governance by offering investors clear signals about a company&rsquo;s    future financial health and by imposing discipline on corporate managers.</p>  <div class="textBox">  <h4>The Impact of Dividends          and Share Prices on Shareholder Wealth</h4>  <p>Profitable corporations can either retain          their after-tax earnings to use for future investments, or they can pay          out these earnings to shareholders.&nbsp; Payouts generally take two forms;          corporations buy back shares from shareholders, or firms pay a dividend          to shareholders.&nbsp; From the shareholder perspective, retained earnings          and share repurchases push up the company&rsquo;s share prices.&nbsp; With a          dividend, shareholders receive a cash payment, rather than a higher          share price.&nbsp; Thus in all cases, the shareholder&rsquo;s wealth &mdash; as reflected          by the combination of the share price and dividend payments &mdash; increases          as the company becomes more profitable.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Some people mistakenly view dividend          payments as if they were &ldquo;bonus payments,&rdquo; or funds received by          shareholders above and beyond the value of the shares.&nbsp; From this          perspective, dividends would be a bit like &ldquo;manna from heaven.&rdquo;&nbsp; But          this is not the case.&nbsp; When earnings are used to pay out dividends, the          funds cannot be used in other ways that increase shareholder wealth.&nbsp; As          Microsoft explained to its shareholders before making its one-time $3          per share special dividend payment:&nbsp; &ldquo;Mathematically, after a company          makes a large one-time distribution, the overall value of the company          declines by the amount of the distribution, which in turn reduces the          stock prices by a similar amount.&rdquo;*</p>  <p>To elaborate, when a corporation has          retained earnings, they are included in the assessment of the firm&rsquo;s net          worth; these funds are essentially &ldquo;money in the bank&rdquo; that can be used          by managers for future investments.&nbsp; By adding to the company&rsquo;s net          worth, retained earnings push its share price higher than it would be if          these funds were not held by the firm.&nbsp; So when a firm pays out these          funds to shareholders, either through share repurchases or dividends,          then the company&rsquo;s net worth falls &mdash; the money that was at the company&rsquo;s          disposal has been transferred out of the company to the shareholders.&nbsp; A          lower net worth results in a lower share price.&nbsp; With a dividend, the          shareholder receives a cash payment, which compensates for the lower          share price.&nbsp; With share repurchases, the company buys back shares,          reducing the total number of shares outstanding; this has the effect of          making the remaining outstanding shares more valuable, so their price          rises.</p>  <p>Retained earnings, share repurchases, and          dividends all have their advantages and disadvantages from the          perspective of the firm&rsquo;s management and its shareholders.&nbsp; There is an          extensive literature examining these preferences.&nbsp; From the tax          perspective of the shareholder, rising share prices implies higher          capital gains taxes, while dividend increases mean higher dividend          taxes.&nbsp; Some shareholders prefer capital gains taxes, because they have          to be paid only when the shares are sold.&nbsp; Because shareholders can          control when they will sell shares, they can potentially defer capital          gains taxes for many years.&nbsp; Some shareholders favor dividends, even          though they lack the advantages associated with deferral, preferring the          flexibility that comes with cash dividend payments.&nbsp; This liquidity          allows investors to more easily manage their financial affairs,          re-directing funds to new investments or to meet other needs.&nbsp; Further,          some prefer dividends believing that they offer important means to judge          the firm&rsquo;s financial health and future prospects.</p>  <p><font size="1">*&ldquo;Microsoft          Outlines Quarterly Dividend, Four-Year Stock Buyback Plan, and Special          Dividend to Shareholders,&rdquo; Microsoft Press Release, July 20, 2004.</font></p>  </div>  <p>But other    economists and analysts have responded that &ldquo;double taxation&rdquo; is not as severe    a problem as it often is presented as being, because more than half of    dividend payments do <em>not </em>face double taxation.&nbsp; These dividend payments    are made to entities &mdash; such as pension funds, 401(k) plans, and non-profit    institutions &mdash; that are not subject to income tax.&nbsp; Further, a significant    portion of corporate earnings manage to escape taxation at the corporate    level, as firms make use of available tax breaks and other tax-avoidance    schemes to lower or eliminate their tax bills.&nbsp; Brookings Institution    economist   <st1:personname xmlns:st1="urn:x-prefix:st1">William Gale</st1:personname> has found that &ldquo;[a]bout one    quarter of corporate income is taxed at the individual level, but not the    corporate level; one quarter is taxed at the corporate level, but not the    individual level; and one quarter appears never to be taxed.&nbsp; <em>While the    emphasis and public discussion has been on the so-called double taxation of    corporate income, the non-taxation of corporate income is probably even bigger</em>    (emphasis added)&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn12" id="_ftnref12">[12]</a></p>  <p>Not only is the extent of double taxation exaggerated, but it is    inappropriately presented as a fairness issue, implying that dividends are    being treated unfairly if they are taxed twice.&nbsp; But wages are also taxed    twice, being subject to both income and payroll taxes.&nbsp; In general, the number    of times income is taxed is not the relevant equity issue.&nbsp; Equity, in the    context of taxes, is about how the burden of taxes is borne by different    income groups and whether taxpayers in similar circumstance pay similar    amounts of tax.&nbsp; The appropriate fairness issue, therefore, is whether the tax    cut for dividend and capital gains income shifts the burden of raising revenue    on to wages and away from income generated by stocks and whether it weakens    the progressivity of the tax code by giving a substantial tax break to those    high-income households that own the lion&rsquo;s share of equities (see discussion    of distribution issues starting on page 15).</p>  <h3>Long-Term Economic Impact of the Tax Cut</h3>  <p>The most detailed study of the effect of reducing the impact of    the so-called double taxation of corporate income was conducted by the    Treasury Department in 1992.<a href="#_ftn13" id="_ftnref13">[13]</a>&nbsp;    The analysis looked at a number of options, which involved more substantial    tax reductions than those enacted in 2003, and concluded that all of the    options would have a positive impact on the economy.&nbsp; It concluded such a tax    change &ldquo;will encourage capital to shift into the corporate sector&rdquo; and    &ldquo;stimulate improvements in overall economic well-being.&rdquo;&nbsp; Treasury reached    these conclusions in large part because it assumed that the cost of the tax    cuts would have <em>no</em> impact on the deficit.&nbsp; As explained in the box on    the next page, to the extent that the cost of tax cuts increases the deficit,    the tax cuts will reduce national saving and thereby lower investment and    reduce long-term growth.</p>  <p>More recently, a study published in the <em>National </em><st1:personname xmlns:st1="urn:x-prefix:st1"><em>Tax</em></st1:personname><em> Journal </em>showed that the    type of dividend tax cut enacted in 2003 would result in lower marginal    effective tax rates on corporate investments, which could be expected to have    some positive effect on the economy.<a href="#_ftn14" id="_ftnref14">[14]</a>&nbsp;    But this study, as well, assumed that the cost of the tax cut would be fully    offset.&nbsp; It noted that its &ldquo;calculations overstate any implied benefits to the    economy&rdquo; from the tax cut if the lost revenues resulted in higher deficits.</p>  <div class="textBox">  <h4>Impact of Lower          National Saving on Long-Term Growth</h4>  <p>National saving is a key determinate of          long-term economic growth, because saving is needed to fund new          investment without borrowing from abroad.&nbsp; Investment by businesses in          factories and equipment ultimately leads to growth in the economy.&nbsp;          Economic growth is desirable, as it generally raises the standard of          living of Americans.&nbsp;</p>  <p>A fundamental issue          with tax cuts is whether they have been &ldquo;paid for.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the revenue          losses associated with tax cuts are not offset, the tax cuts increase          the budget deficit.&nbsp; This has the effect of reducing national saving,          which is the combination of saving by the private sector and the          positive or negative saving (i.e., surplus or deficit) by government.&nbsp;          As the government borrows to finance the deficit, it shrinks the pool of          saving available for investment.&nbsp; Increases in the deficit and declines          in national saving can reduce the future incomes of Americans in one of          two ways:</p>  <ul>      <li>The decline in            national saving can lead to a decline in domestic investment.*&nbsp; If            this occurs, long-term economic growth will be reduced.&nbsp; Slower            economic growth will result in a lower standard of living for            Americans in the future.</li>      <li>Alternatively,            the effects of increased government borrowing on national saving can            be offset by an inflow of foreign capital.&nbsp; In this case, investment            does not decline and economic growth does not fall, but the extent to            which Americans benefit from this growth in the economy is            diminished.&nbsp; The reliance on foreign capital to fund investment means            that the returns on these investments flow back to the foreign            investors rather than to Americans.</li>  </ul>  <p>Thus, tax cuts that          increase the deficit and reduce national saving will lower the incomes          of Americans in the future, regardless of whether the decline in          national saving leads to lower investment, an inflow of foreign capital,          or some combination of both.**</p>  <p><font size="1">* Typically,          this decline in domestic investment is facilitated by higher interest          rates.&nbsp; Interest rates are, in essence, the &ldquo;price&rdquo; that businesses must          pay to borrow funds for investment purposes.&nbsp; As saving declines and          funds available for investment become scarcer, their price (in the form          of interest rates) rises.</font></p>  <p><font size="1">**          For a detailed discussion of this topic, see William Gale and Peter          Orszag, &ldquo;Budget Deficits, National Savings, and Interest Rates,&rdquo; Tax          Policy Center, October 2004.</font></p>  </div>  <p>It is therefore essential when examining the dividend and capital    gains tax cuts to take into account its impact on the deficit.&nbsp; If extended    past its 2008 expiration date and ultimately made permanent without offsets,    the dividend and capital gains tax cuts will add $405 billion to the debt by    2015, reflecting the $148 billion cost of the enacted tax cuts before they are    slated to expire at the end of 2008, another $148 billion for the cost of    extending the tax cuts, and $110billion in additional interest    payments associated with the higher level of debt caused by the tax cuts.&nbsp;    Analyses that take these deficit effects into account find that if the tax cut    is made permanent, it is likely to have little if any positive impact on    long-term growth.&nbsp;</p>  <ul>      <li>The Congressional Research Service examined a number of    scenarios, using different assumptions about the response to the dividend and    capital gains tax cuts, and found that under <em>all </em>of the cases, the    effect of the tax cuts on private saving was not large enough to offset the    negative effects caused by higher deficits.&nbsp; The study concluded that &ldquo;the    dividend relief proposal would harm long-term growth as long as it is based on    deficit finance.&rdquo;<a href="#_ftn15" id="_ftnref15">[15]</a></li>      <li>Brookings Institution economists   <st1:personname xmlns:st1="urn:x-prefix:st1">William Gale</st1:personname> and   <st1:personname xmlns:st1="urn:x-prefix:st1">Peter Orszag</st1:personname> found that the dividend and    capital gains tax cuts &ldquo;could help to reduce biases in the allocation of    capital by reducing the generally higher tax imposed on capital invested in    the corporate sector.&rdquo;&nbsp; Gale and Orszag concluded, however, that as long as    the tax cuts continue to add to the deficit, &ldquo;the net effects would be roughly    a zero effect on long-term growth&rdquo; under optimistic assumptions about the    effects of the tax cuts on capital allocation.<a href="#_ftn16" id="_ftnref16">[16]</a>&nbsp;      Under less optimistic assumptions, the effects on long-term growth could be      negative.</li>  </ul>  <h2>Recent Evidence on the    Dividend Tax Cut</h2>  <p>Since the tax cuts were enacted, there has been a    flurry of research investigating the impact of the tax cuts on corporate    behavior, with emphasis on whether the tax cuts are encouraging companies to    pay out dividends.&nbsp; So far, researchers have learned little from    aggregate data on the level of dividends.&nbsp; Because there has not been a    dramatic shift in the total amount of dividends being paid, these data have    not provided sufficient information to determine the extent to which corporate    dividend policies have changed as a result of the tax cuts.</p>  <p>The aggregate data on dividends are hard to interpret in large    part because the level of dividends paid by corporations has, since the 1980s,    been increasingly dominated by a relatively small number of large    corporations.<a href="#_ftn17" id="_ftnref17">[17]</a>&nbsp;    Although there is a general belief that dividends have declined precipitously    over the past two decades, this has more to do with the number of firms paying    dividends than the amounts being paid out.&nbsp; While the number of firms paying    dividends has declined by 50 percent over the past two decades, the total    amount of dividends paid grew slightly in real terms over this period.&nbsp; The    result has been a concentration of dividends among the largest dividend    payers.&nbsp; Small actions by these large companies can overwhelm actions by    smaller companies.&nbsp; As a result, a decision by several smaller companies to    increase dividends can be offset in the aggregate data by the decision of one    large company to lower its dividend.&nbsp; Such concentration makes it difficult    not only to detect shifts in dividend policies, but to explain with precision    why these shifts are occurring.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Indeed, the    Congressional Research Service could not detect any noticeable surge in the    aggregate dividend data, released by the Bureau of Economic Affairs, for the    period through the middle of 2004.&nbsp; (The BEA data show a big jump at the end    of 2004, when Microsoft made a massive $32 billion one-time payment.<a href="#_ftn18" id="_ftnref18">[18]</a>)&nbsp;    To overcome these problems, researchers have looked at subsets of firms to try    to isolate the effects of the tax cut on dividend policy.&nbsp; Although the    studies generally find that the tax cut has influenced corporate decisions to    initiate or increase dividend payments, some evidence indicates that the    dividends were not always well-suited to achieve desired improvements in    corporate governance or economic efficiency, weakening their potential to    yield long-term economic gains.</p>  <h3>Executives With Large Stockholdings in Companies React to Tax Cut</h3>  <p>Several    studies have found that the most important factor influencing firms&rsquo; decisions    to start paying dividends or to increase existing dividends is the composition    of the stock holdings of company executives.&nbsp; In companies where top    executives hold company shares and thus would directly benefit from the    dividend tax cut, there has been a much greater likelihood of the company    initiating or increasing dividends in the aftermath of the 2003 tax cut.&nbsp; A    study byNBER and Federal Reserve economists found that about half of    the increase in the number of firms initiating or increasing dividend payments    could be attributed to the influence of executive stock ownership.<a href="#_ftn19" id="_ftnref19">[19]</a></p>  <p>The dividend tax cut offered significant benefits to corporate executives    that owned company shares.&nbsp; Assuming these executives are in the 35    percent bracket, the tax cut boosts the after-tax value of dividend payments    by 31 percent, as $100 of dividends is now worth $85 after taxes rather than    $65.&nbsp; This is a larger increase than shareholders who are in lower tax    brackets would receive, particularly those shareholders who receive no benefit    from the tax cut because they hold their shares in nontaxable retirement    accounts.&nbsp; Moreover, by increasing dividend payouts, executives are able    to overcome constraints they typically face on their ability to sell shares in    their company, either in terms of contractual restrictions or implicit    restrictions imposed by the market which may view insider selling negatively.&nbsp;    Receiving a payout in the form of a dividend gives executives with large    holdings of company stock a way to diversify their portfolios.</p>  <p>Given the    outsized benefits that executives with sizeable holdings of their companies&rsquo;    shares would receive from increased dividends, it is probably not surprising    that they have reacted favorably to the tax cut.<a href="#_ftn20" id="_ftnref20">[20]</a>&nbsp;    While these actions come at a high price to the Treasury, it is unclear    whether they are consistently in the best interest of the firms and the    shareholders.&nbsp; Executive compensation packages should in theory be    designed to align the executive&rsquo;s self-interest with the best interest of the    firm and its shareholders, but this goal is not always achieved, as recent    corporate scandals indicate.</p>  <h3>Some Dividends Are One-Time, Or Substitutes for Share Repurchases</h3>  <p>The studies to date indicate that the number of firms paying dividends has    grown since the tax cut, although the total number of companies paying regular    dividends is still below the levels seen in the 1980s and the 1990s.&nbsp; But    not all of the dividends paid out in response to the tax cut have been regular    dividends; some have come in the form of one-time, special dividends.&nbsp;    Unlike a regular dividend, a special dividend indicates that a company has not    committed itself to any future dividend payouts, mitigating some of the    important effects that an ongoing, regular dividend payment can have,    particularly in terms of corporate governance.&nbsp; To meet the demands of    regular dividend payments, managers in theory become more accountable to    shareholder interests.</p>  <p>Among the    one-time payouts, Microsoft&rsquo;s $32 billion special dividend has received the    most attention, but special dividends are also being utilized by smaller,    closely held companies.<a href="#_ftn21" id="_ftnref21">[21]</a>&nbsp;    The Council of Economic Advisers writes that &ldquo;nearly 150 firms started paying    dividends after the tax cut, adding more than $1.5 billion to total quarterly    dividends,&rdquo; but about 40 percent of this dollar total represents one-time,    special dividends.<a href="#_ftn22" id="_ftnref22">[22]</a>&nbsp;    Only the regular dividends will continue to be paid out in the future; there    are no guarantees that special dividend payments will be repeated.</p>  <p>The studies have also raised the issue about the extent to which firms that    increased or initiated dividends used these dividend payments to replace share    repurchases, which is the other approach that firms use to pay out their    earnings to shareholders (<strong>see box on page 8</strong>).&nbsp; Failure to increase    total payout undermines one of the stated goals of the dividend tax cut, which    is to reduce the proportion of earnings that are retained by the corporations.&nbsp;    These goals can be achieved only if total payout &mdash; repurchases and dividends    combined &mdash; increases.</p>  <p>The study    byNBER and Federal Reserve economists shows that firms that increased    or initiated dividends did not increase their total payout about half the    time.<a href="#_ftn23" id="_ftnref23">[23]</a>&nbsp;    The effect was particularly strong for companies that were paying dividends    for the first time.&nbsp; The authors estimate that the observed reduction in    repurchases offset nearly three-quarters of the newly paid dividends,    significantly lowering the increase in total payout.&nbsp; Another NBER study by    economists from the   <st1:place xmlns:st1="urn:x-prefix:st1"><st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype> of   <st1:placename>California</st1:placename></st1:place>,   <st1:city xmlns:st1="urn:x-prefix:st1"><st1:place>Berkeley</st1:place></st1:city>, however, could not detect among    firms initiating dividends a reduction in the level of repurchases relative to    the period prior to the tax cut, and thus concluded that substitution of    dividends for repurchases had not occurred.<a href="#_ftn24" id="_ftnref24">[24]</a>&nbsp;    But, given the limitations of the data, the study could not rule out the    possibility that some substitution may have occurred.</p>  <h3>Other Factors Affecting Dividend Payments</h3>  <p>Studies    have clearly found that the dividend tax cut prompted some firms to increase    or initiate dividends, particularly those where the top executives had large    amounts of company stock.&nbsp; Researchers have asked whether other factors may    also have influenced these decisions and the size of the reaction to the tax    cut.&nbsp; For instance, the NBER study by the economists from the   <st1:place xmlns:st1="urn:x-prefix:st1"><st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype> of   <st1:placename>California</st1:placename></st1:place>,   <st1:city xmlns:st1="urn:x-prefix:st1"><st1:place>Berkeley</st1:place></st1:city>, found that the reaction to the    1986 tax reform, which also set the tax rates for dividend and capital gains    income at the same level, was noticeably different.&nbsp; Firms responded to    the 1986 reforms with one-time, special dividends to a much greater extent    than has been the case after the 2003 tax cut.&nbsp; While the different    responses may have had to do with the type of tax changes enacted in 1986, the    study suggests that it may also have been due to the particular circumstances    facing firms in 2003.</p>  <ul>      <li>For instance, firms may have increased regular (as opposed to    one-time) dividends more after the 2003 tax cut because firms had unusually    high levels of cash on hand prior to enactment of that tax cut, giving them    the resources needed to begin paying out dividends.&nbsp; Indeed, BEA data reported    by the Congressional   <st1:personname xmlns:st1="urn:x-prefix:st1">Budget</st1:personname> Office show that corporate retained      earnings jumped significantly during 2003; as a share of the economy, they      reached levels not seen since the 1960s.</li>      <li>The study also notes that firms in 2003 may have been influenced by the      well-publicized corporate scandals, which created an environment where      corporations were feeling pressure to reassure shareholders.&nbsp; Companies      may have turned to dividends as a way to send a positive signal to      shareholders about the financial integrity of the companies following the      tax cut.</li>  </ul>  <p>Another    study suggests that the increase in dividend payers may reflect the growing    number of &ldquo;mature&rdquo; firms.&nbsp; Companies that first became public corporations in    the 1980s and 1990s have matured and thus tend to have more stable cash flows    and to be better positioned to pay dividends.<a href="#_ftn25" id="_ftnref25">[25]</a>    &nbsp;Microsoft, which reportedly was not influenced by the 2003 tax cut when    making its decision to initiate regular dividends, is an example of such a    firm. &nbsp;The authors of this study found that &ldquo;some portion of the increase in    dividend payouts by US firms is due to young firms maturing and moving into    this new stage in their life.&rdquo;</p>  <p>In summary, a range of factors likely helped create an environment    conducive to increases in dividend payments following enactment of the tax    cut, affecting the extent to which firms responded to the tax change.&nbsp; A    key question is the extent to which these and other factors, rather than the    tax cut, will influence corporate decisions on dividend payouts in the future.</p>  <h2>Distribution Effects of the Capital Gains and    Dividend Tax Cuts</h2>  <p>Supporters of the    dividend and capital gains tax cuts often argue that the benefits associated    with these tax cuts flow to large numbers of households.<a href="#_ftn26" id="_ftnref26">[26]</a>&nbsp;    They point out that about half of American households now own stock and that a    majority of these stock holders have incomes below $100,000.&nbsp; What this    story leaves out is the fact that while large numbers of households own small    amounts of stock, a relative small percentage of households own the bulk of    equities.</p>  <ul>      <li>The Survey of Consumer Finance (SCF), conducted by the Federal    Reserve, shows that the top one percent of households owns about 23 percent of    all stock, and the top 5 percent of households owns half.&nbsp; In contrast, the    bottom 60 percent of households owns only 10 percent of all stock.</li>      <li>Furthermore, high-income households are more likely to hold    these shares in taxable accounts than middle-income families, who are more    likely to save through retirement accounts that are not taxable (such as    401(k)s and Individual Retirement Accounts).&nbsp; Only securities held in taxable    accounts benefit from the capital gains and dividend tax cuts.&nbsp; According to    the SCF data, households in the top one percent of the income spectrum hold 79      percent of their stocks in taxable accounts, compared with about half of the      stock that middle-income families own.</li>  </ul>  <p>Given the    distribution of stock ownership and the fact that those with the highest    incomes received the largest dividend tax cut, with the tax rate they pay on    dividend income reduced from 35 percent to 15 percent, it is not surprising    that the   <st1:place xmlns:st1="urn:x-prefix:st1"><st1:placename><st1:personname>Tax</st1:personname></st1:placename><st1:placename>Policy</st1:placename><st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place> found the following:</p>  <ul>      <li>More than half &mdash; 53 percent &mdash; of the      benefits of the capital gains and dividend tax cuts in 2005 will flow to the      top 0.2 percent of households, those with incomes over $1 million.&nbsp;      These households will receive an average tax cut from these provisions of      $37,962 in 2005.</li>      <li>Households with income over $200,000 will receive      more than three-quarters    of the tax-cut benefits.&nbsp; And those with incomes over $100,000 will receive      90    percent of the benefits.&nbsp; Only 10 percent of the benefits of the dividend and    capital gains tax cuts will flow to the 86 percent of households with incomes    under $100,000.</li>      <li>While the dividend and capital gains tax cuts would boost the    after-tax income of those with income over $1 million by 1.9 percent in 2005,    it would raise the after-tax income of households with incomes under $75,000    by 0.1 percent or less.</li>  </ul>  <p>Finally, it has    been argued that anyone who owns shares in a company that either initiates a    dividend or increases an existing dividend will benefit from this change, even    if the shares are held in a non-taxable retirement account.&nbsp; The implication    is that this new or higher dividend payment is a type of &ldquo;bonus payment&rdquo; that    will benefit all shareholders, regardless of whether they receive a tax break    (see box on page 8).&nbsp; But this logic misses a key point, which is that the    price of a share of stock in a company that makes a dividend payment is lower    than the share price would be if the earnings were retained, with the result    that the overall value of owning the stock &mdash; which reflects the combination of    the dividend payment and the share price&mdash; is essentially unchanged by the    dividend payment.&nbsp; Thus, only those shareholders who hold these shares in    taxable accounts benefit from the tax cut.</p>  <h2>Conclusion</h2>  <p>The findings to    date indicate that some companies have increased or started to pay dividends    in response to the tax cut.&nbsp; Other factors (including high levels of cash on    hand and post-Enron pressures to reassure stockholders) may also have    influenced these corporate decisions and the magnitude of the reaction to the    tax cut.&nbsp; Further, some companies have undertaken dividend policies &mdash; such as    using one-time, special dividends, or substituting dividends for share    buybacks &mdash; that may dilute the extent to which the policy change will lead to    long-term benefits for the economy.&nbsp;</p>  <p>When it    comes to the cost of these tax cuts and who benefits from them, the evidence    is unequivocal.&nbsp; Official cost estimates indicate that if these tax cuts are    extended and their costs are not offset, they will add $405 billion to the    debt from the time of their enactment to 2015.&nbsp; This high cost is crucial for    understanding the full impact of the tax cuts on the economy.&nbsp; Higher debt    reduces national savings, leading to lower national income in the future.&nbsp;    When these negative effects are taken into account, the net economic impact of    the tax cuts is near zero or negative.&nbsp;</p>  <p>Further,    the flip side of the large revenue loss is the large tax-cut benefit that    flows disproportionately to high-income households, who are the largest    holders of stocks.&nbsp; The   <st1:place xmlns:st1="urn:x-prefix:st1"><st1:placename><st1:personname>Tax</st1:personname></st1:placename><st1:placename>Policy</st1:placename><st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place> estimates that the 0.2    percent of households with incomes over $1 million will receive nearly half of    the benefits of these tax cuts in 2005, amounting to an average annual tax cut    of $35,500 for these households.</p>  <div id="endNotes">  <p><b>End Notes:</b></p>  <p><a href="#_ftnref1" id="_ftn1">[1]</a>        The author appreciates helpful assistance and comments on earlier drafts        from Jason Furman, Bill Gale, Bob Greenstein, David Kamin, Cheng Lee, and        Isaac Shapiro.</p>  <p><a href="#_ftnref2" id="_ftn2">[2]</a>Raj        Chetty and Emmanuel Saez, &ldquo;Dividend Taxes and Corporate Behavior:&nbsp;
