1: Non-Tax Issues of a Farm Transfer Components of Change in a Farm Transfer</h3><p>A 
change in farm ownership is often a significant transition, with two significant 
components. One is the &quot;procedural&quot; dimension dealing with the how, 
when and what to transfer. This could include tax implications, credit arrangements, 
business organization, operating agreements, insurance, wills and legal documentation. 
</p><p>The second is the &quot;psychological&quot; dimension. This involves the 
family and relationship dynamics that often determine the ultimate success of 
a family farm business transfer. Components include the meshing of personal and 
business goals, the willingness to let go of ownership, the selection and training 
of a successor(s) and communication among family members.</p><h4>Transition Manager 
and Team Work</h4><p>A farm transfer and succession plan can be complex. Given 
the multitude of components an advisory team is essential. A business management 
advisor can help the family: </p><ul> <li>clarify goals</li><li>identify alternatives<br> 
</li><li>assist with business and financial planning</li><li>understand the potential 
tax and legal ramifications</li></ul><p>The accounting and legal advisors can 
fine tune the alternatives and implement the decisions made by the family.</p><p>The 
most successful farm business transfers usually reveal a strong transition manager 
who acts like a team captain. Ideally the farm business owner would fill this 
role, providing the leadership, attitude and patience needed for a successful 
transition. </p><h4>Important Considerations</h4><h5>Clarifying Goals</h5><p>Before 
formulating any meaningful transfer plans, it is crucial to clearly identify family 
and business goals and communicate these to all farm family members. Some farm 
families find this easy, others benefit from professional advice. A current business 
advisor may be able to help with this step or direct you to another professional. 
</p><h5>Farm Business Viability</h5><p>Since the business must be profitable - 
or have profit potential - for a farm transfer to occur, determine the financial 
condition of the business early in the transfer planning process.</p><h5>Financial 
Needs of Parents</h5><p>If parents have other assets or sources of income they 
could be more generous in both a transfer price and credit terms. However, this 
would not be the case if the parents have considerable cash needs. </p><h5>Successor 
Training </h5><p>A successful farm business transition is more likely where the 
successor(s) have management experience. This is often obtained through owning 
assets, revenue-sharing arrangements, or where progressive management responsibility 
is given over time. <br> </p><h3><a name="sect2"></a>Section 2 - Methods of Transferring 
Farm Business Assets</h3><p> There are several methods of transferring farm business 
assets. </p><ol> <li> <strong>Bequest</strong> </li></ol><p>Farming and other 
assets can be transferred by bequest through an individual's will. If certain 
criteria are met, most farm assets can transfer from parent to child upon death 
free of immediate tax. In the absence of a transfer plan the will can be a &quot;contingency&quot; 
plan. Unfortunately some families use the will as their primary transfer vehicle, 
creating uncertainty for the farming children. It also prevents farming children 
from developing their own succession plans with their children. </p><ol start="2"> 
<li><strong>Gifts<sup>1</sup></strong></li></ol><p>While farming children would 
prefer this method, not all farmers can afford to make such a gift. Many farmers 
do partially gift their farms by selling to their children at below fair market 
value or by gifting certain assets. In either case there is no tax on a gift of 
farming assets. The gift of a non-farming asset to a child however may be taxable. 
Placing a child on title to a property is also a considered a gift to the child 
and a disposition or transfer of the property for the parent. </p><p>One exception 
is the gifting of inventory, which is fully taxable in the year it is transferred. 
</p><p>Gifts to minor children or spouses can result in property income from the 
asset being attributed back to the giver. These rules are covered in Section</p><ol start="3"> 
<li><strong>Sale</strong></li></ol><p>The sale of farm assets to family members 
at fair market value (FMV) is the same as selling to a non-family member. Normal 
tax calculations are made. Good planning is essential to create the desired tax 
results. </p><ol start="4"> <li><strong>Combination - Bequest, Gift, Sale</strong><b> 
</b></li></ol><p>Most transfers involve a combination of bequest, gift and sale. 
Parents often desire to sell farm assets at the lowest price they can afford in 
order to defer the maximum amount of tax. A bequest can then be used to distribute 
other assets to non-farming children on the parents' death. </p><h3><a name="sect3"></a>Section 
3 - Income Tax Rollovers and Deferrals</h3><p>The Income Tax Act allows farmers 
to defer tax on the transfer of farming assets to a spouse or child. This is called 
a &quot;rollover&quot;. Spouses can also receive non-farming assets by way of 
rollovers. On a rollover of farming assets to a child any price between zero and 
fair market value can be chosen, although for tax calculation purposes the tax 
cost is used as the lowest value. The rollover provides significant flexibility 
in choosing appropriate transfer values. Even though the $750,000 capital gains 
exemption may be available, it is desirable to maintain the eligibility for the 
rollover. <br> </p><p>The term &quot;child&quot; has an extended meaning and includes 
a daughter, son, grandchild, great grandchild, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, adopted 
child, step child or their spouses who are resident in Canada. In addition a person 
who, at any time before aged 19, was wholly dependent on the taxpayer for support 
and of whom the taxpayer had, at that time, in law or in fact, the custody and 
control is considered a child.<sup>2</sup></p><p>Rollovers of property to a child 
must meet the requirements outlined below. </p><h4> Requirements for Tax Deferral 
Rollovers from Parent to Child</h4><p>To qualify for the rollover to a child the 
eligible property must, before the transfer, be principally used in a farming 
business in which the individual, their spouse, common-law partner or their child 
or parent, was actively involved on a regular and continuous basis.<sup>3</sup> 
In 2006 the words &quot;immediately before&quot; were inserted into Section 70 
of the Act that made the provision more difficult to meet. However Canada Revenue 
Agency (CRA) has indicated they intend to revert to the phrase &quot;before the 
transfer&quot;.</p><p>According to the CRA &quot;principally used&quot; means 
the property must have been farmed for more than 50 per cent of the time of ownership 
by the transferor. See OMAFRA Factsheet Taxation on the Sale of Farm Assets, Order 
No. 08-047 for a more detailed explanation of the term &quot;principally used&quot;. 
</p><h5>Other Considerations</h5><ul> <li>The eligible property may be owned either 
solely or jointly</li><li>The transfer may take place while the taxpayer is alive, 
or at the time of death</li><li>Rollovers are allowed on successive transfers 
such as a rollover of property to a spouse and then to a child while alive or 
upon death. The assets eligible for a rollover could also pass to a spousal trust 
and then to a named child</li><li>Eligible property transferred from an estate 
must vest indefeasibly with a child, which means it must transfer to the beneficiary 
within 36 months of death with no strings attached. A longer period may be granted 
if special circumstances warrant it</li><li>On the death of a child an election 
is allowed to transfer the property to a parent on a rollover basis.<sup>4</sup> 
</li></ul><h5>&nbsp;</h5><h5>Pitfalls that could negate rollovers </h5><ul> <li>Rental 
of assets to persons other than children or spouses for more than 50 per cent 
of the ownership period negates rollover and deferral. </li><li>A &quot;tainted&quot; 
spousal trust can negate a rollover. This can occur if the spousal trust breaks 
certain rules. For example if a spousal trust makes payments to someone other 
than the spouse it would no longer be a valid spousal trust.</li><li>An obvious 
beneficiary of a spousal trust must be named. For example, a will that leaves 
land to a named beneficiary if they outlive the spouse, but to a different beneficiary 
if the first beneficiary should pre-decease the spouse, can negate a rollover. 
</li></ul><h3><a name="sect4"></a>Section 4 - Capital Gains</h3><h4>Taxation of 
Capital Gains</h4><p>Fifty per cent of a capital gain is tax free. The other half 
is subject to regular tax. This portion, called the taxable capital gain, is added 
to all other income in the year the gain occurs. Any allowable capital losses 
can be deducted from the taxable capital gain. If the capital gain occurs on a 
corporately owned asset, 50 per cent of the gain is tax free and is allocated 
to the Capital Dividend Account. Dividends from this account are received tax 
free by the shareholder. The other half of the gain is taxable in the corporation. 
</p><p>Some tax credits may be affected in the current year and/or the year after 
reporting a capital gain, even though the capital gains exemption is used. This 
is because the taxable capital gain is reported on your tax return and affects 
the calculations of tax credits even though the exemption is used to reduce the 
tax paid. The increased net income may result in the claw back of some benefits 
such as the Old Age Security and Child Tax Benefits in the current year and may 
also reduce them in the year following the capital gain. </p><h4>$750,000 Capital 
Gains Exemption<sup>5</sup></h4><p>In 2007, the Capital Gains Exemption was increased 
to $750,000 from $500,000 for dispositions occurring after March 18, 2007. The 
$750,000 Capital Gains Exemption is available to individuals on the sale of qualified 
farm property. Anyone who used the entire $100,000 general exemption when it was 
eliminated in 1994 has $650,000 remaining. The exemption is also available to 
partners in a partnership, since capital gains in a partnership flows directly 
to the partners who can then use the exemption. The capital gains exemption is 
not available to corporations; however, the shares of a family farm corporation 
are eligible for the exemption. <br> </p><p>Qualified farm property<sup>6</sup> 
includes:</p><ul> <li>farm land and buildings</li><li>shares in a family farm 
corporation</li><li>an interest in a family farm partnership </li><li>quota</li></ul><p>Equipment 
and machinery are not eligible for the capital gains exemption. However, in a 
partnership or corporation, the value of equipment and inventory is included in 
the corporate shares or partnership interest. </p><p>Qualified farm property must 
meet the following definitions:<sup>7</sup> </p><ul> <li>Property must be principally 
used in farming by one of the following qualified users: </li><li>the individual 
</li><li>the spouse, child or parent of the individual</li><li>or by a family 
farm partnership or corporation of the individual, spouse, child or parent <br> 
</li></ul><p>and</p><ul> <li>Property purchased prior to June 18, 1987: <ul> <li>must 
be used in principally farming in the year of sale or</li><li>have been principally 
used in farming for any 5 years during its ownership </li></ul></li><li>Property 
purchased after June 17, 1987: <ul> <li> must be owned for 24 months prior to 
the sale </li></ul></li></ul><p>and</p><ul> <li> in at least two years, the gross 
farm revenue of one of the qualified users who is actively engaged in farming 
the property must exceed income from all other sources </li></ul><p>or</p><ul> 
<li>the property was principally used by a family farm partnership or corporation 
in a two-year period, during which time the individual, spouse, child, parent 
or partnership of which they are a member, was actively involved in the farming 
business.<br> </li></ul><p>In all cases, the qualifying individuals - whether 
farming as a sole proprietorship, a partnership or corporation - must be actively 
engaged in management and/or the day-to-day activities of the business.<br> </p><h5>Definition 
of &quot;Principally Used&quot;</h5><p>Similar to the requirements under the rollover 
provision, the CRA defines &quot;principally used&quot; to mean &quot;more than 
50 per cent&quot; from either a time or usage perspective.<br> </p><h5>1994 $100,000 
Capital Gains Election</h5><p>In 1994, the $100,000 capital gains exemption for 
general property was eliminated. At that time, individuals were allowed to elect 
to increase the adjusted cost base of their property by up to $100,000, but not 
exceeding the February 1994 value. If you made such an election on your qualified 
farm property, you are deemed to have disposed of the property and reacquired 
it in 1994. As a result you must now meet the more difficult post-June 17, 1987, 
rules for qualified farm property on a future sale.</p><h5>Splitting Capital Gains 
Between Spouses<br> </h5><p>If both spouses contributed to the purchase of property, 
they can split the gains to reduce taxes. Although both may be on title, it is 
the contribution toward the purchase that is the most critical. Generally, the 
capital gains from assets that are transferred to a spouse by way of gift attribute 
back to the spouse who transferred the asset. However the timing of the transfer 
is important. </p><p>Spouses added to title on or before December 31, 1971, would 
likely be able to split the capital gain. However, if they were added after that 
date, attribution rules would prevent splitting. See Section 6 for an explanation 
of the spousal attribution rules. <br> <br> If the property is the asset of a 
spousal partnership, the capital gains will flow through to each partner based 
on their percentage ownership. </p><h4>Calculating Your Capital Gain</h4><h5>Adjusted 
Cost Base</h5><p> To calculate a capital gain or loss, you must know the adjusted 
cost base (ACB). This is the amount deducted from the selling price to determine 
a capital gain or loss. For property obtained before 1972, the ACB is the greater 
of original cost or the December 31, 1971, value. If obtained after 1971, the 
ACB is the purchase price plus costs. The cost base of land is adjusted by adding 
any non-depreciable capital improvements, legal and realty fees to the adjusted 
cost base. The ACB of buildings is increased by any capital improvements or additions, 
beyond just the normal maintenance and repair. Table 1, Calculating Capital Gain, 
shows an example of a capital gain calculation.</p><blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote><ol>

Sale Price on a Transfer</h3><p>In the Act and this Factsheet it is stated that 
certain eligible assets can be transferred to a child at values anywhere between 
their tax cost and fair market value (FMV). While these values are used to calculate 
tax implications, it does not prevent an asset being transferred below the tax 
cost, as in the case of a gift. For depreciable assets the tax cost is the undepreciated 
capital cost (UCC), and for land and other capital property it is the adjusted 
cost base (ACB). These values are used to calculate taxes</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> 
A parent sells a piece of eligible land to a child for $50,000. The fair market 
value (FMV) of the property was $200,000 and it was purchased for $100,000 (ACB). 
What would be the outcome? </p><p>The parent would have proceeds of $50,000 - 
with no capital gain and no tax to pay because that amount is below the ACB. The 
child will pay $50,000 but for future tax calculation he or she is deemed to have 
acquired the land at the ACB of the parent or $100,000. The same result occurs 
if the parent gifted the property to the child.</p><p>If the selling price falls 
between the ACB and FMV part of the tax liability is incurred and part is deferred. 
</p><h4>Utilizing the Capital Gains Exemption</h4><p>The $750,000 capital gains 
exemption makes it attractive for both parties to sell as close to FMV as possible. 
This provides the parent with tax-free proceeds (except for possible application 
of the alternative minimum tax (see Section 9)) and the child an asset with a 
higher ACB. To help finance the business and reduce debt charges, the parent can 
charge a low interest rate. The parent may even forgive a mortgage in his or her 
will. Holding a mortgage from a child also qualifies as a reserve and can spread 
capital gains over 10 years, if needed, to avoid minimum tax.<br> </p><p>Table 
2a and Table 2b, Within Family Transfer of Assets, on previous page, provide a 
quick summary of the transfer options. </p><h3><a name="sect6"></a>Section 6 - 
Transfering Assets to a Spouse or Common Law Partner</h3><p>In general terms capital 
property,<sup>8</sup> which includes most farm assets such as land, buildings, 
machinery, shares and partnership interests, can be transferred to a spouse or 
common law partner on a rollover basis that is fully tax deferred. This can occur 
before or after death. There is also an option to elect out of the rollover and 
allow the asset transfer at its FMV. This can be done on an asset-by-asset basis. 
</p><p>On a transfer to a spouse or common law partner there is no opportunity 
to set the price between the ACB and the FMV as there is on a transfer to a child. 
</p><p>Transfers of inventory and quota are the exceptions to the general rules. 
Inventory can be transferred on a rollover basis on death to any beneficiary however 
it must be transferred at FMV while alive. </p><p>Quota is considered eligible 
capital property and a rollover to a spouse while alive or on death is allowed 
as long as certain conditions are met. The conditions are:<br> </p><ul> <li>that 
the spouse must acquire all of the quota and</li><li> the spouse must carry on 
the business.<sup>9</sup></li></ul><p>However, there is no opportunity to elect 
to have the quota transfer take place at FMV. </p><h4>Attribution Rules<sup>10</sup> 
</h4><p>Assets transferred to a spouse can result in income, such as interest 
or capital gains being attributed back to the transferring spouse. If for example 
a property was rolled over to a spouse and the spouse subsequently sold the property 
and incurred a capital gain, the capital gain would be attributed to the spouse 
who transferred the property and they would have to include the taxable capital 
gain in their income. Business income on the other hand is not attributed back 
to the transferring spouse.</p><p>In order to prevent these attribution rules 
from applying three conditions must be met:</p><ol> <ol> <ol> <li>The property 
must be sold for FMV to the other spouse and consideration received for it.</li><li> 
If debt is part of the consideration received then a commercial rate of interest 
must be charged and always paid by Jan 30th of each year.</li><li>The transferring 
spouse must elect out of the rollover provisions, which will trigger any capital 
gains and will then be taxable in the hands of the transferring spouse.</li></ol></ol></ol><p>Attribution 
rules can also apply to transfers to minor children (income but not capital gains) 
and loans to non-arms length persons. <br> </p><ol> </ol><h3><a name="sect7"></a>Section 
7 - Transfering Assets to a Child</h3><p> This section deals with the tax implications 
of transferring various types of assets to a child. Any differences between a 
transfer while alive and at death are highlighted for the various types of assets.<br> 
</p><h4>Inventory - Livestock<sup>11</sup> , Crops and Supplies</h4><h5>Transfer 
While Alive</h5><p>The tax treatment of inventory is significantly different depending 
on when it is transferred to a child and how the farm files taxes.</p><ul> <li>If 
the transfer takes place while the parent is alive it must transfer at FMV and 
this amount included in the parents income. </li><li>If the farm files income 
tax on the accrual basis the inventory value included in income will be much lower 
than cash basis filers. Cash basis farmers should consider strategies before transferring. 
</li></ul><p>Since cash-basis farmers only report income when received, one approach 
is for the parent to hold an appropriately structured promissory note containing 
restrictions on payment, such as payable 366 days after demand. A note without 
restrictions as to when payment can be demanded represents &quot;absolute payment&quot; 
of the debt, and in such a case CRA could claim that payment has been received 
in full. <br> </p><p>This approach allows inventory payments to be spread over 
a number of years. The payments would be farm income, eligible for CPP and RRSP 
contributions. <br> </p><ul> <li>Other options include using a basic herd deduction 
(in the case of older livestock operations) and the use of optional or mandatory 
inventory adjustments taken in previous years. </li><li>Transfers can also be 
timed for when inventory of crops and supplies are at their lowest. </li></ul><p>If 
the parent and child plan to operate in a partnership or corporation the parent 
could roll the inventory into the corporation or partnership and subsequently 
transfer shares or a partnership interest to the child. The timing of this type 
of transaction is important. If no other assets are transferred and the transfer 
to the child occurs soon after the inventory is moved, CRA could view it as a 
tax avoidance transaction and disallow it. </p><p><strong>Transfers on DeathOn 
death inventory can be rolled over to any beneficiary on a tax-deferred basis. 
When the inventory is sold it becomes income to the beneficiary. Farmers who file 
income tax on the cash basis have three options for reporting inventory and accounts 
receivables (these are called &quot;rights and things&quot;<sup>12</sup> ) on 
death: </strong><br> </p><ul> <li>report the income as part of the terminal tax 
return</li><li>file a special separate return that allows for the deduction of 
personal credits<sup>13</sup> or </li><li>elect to have the rights and things 
rollover to any beneficiary where it is reported as income to the beneficiary 
when the item is sold or receivable is collected.<sup>14</sup> <ol> <ol> <ol>

before 1972 <br> (Part XVII Depreciable Assets)</h4><h5>Transfers While Alive</h5><p>There 
is no tax deferral for buildings, machinery and equipment purchased before 1972. 
They must transfer at their fair market value regardless of the sale price. The 
deemed proceeds for the parent is the fair market value while the cost to the 
child is the amount paid. However if the parent transfers these assets as an outright 
gift, the child is considered to have paid the FMV. </p><p>Most depreciable assets, 
such as equipment, have decreased in value and disappeared since 1971, creating 
no tax concerns; but good buildings may have accrued capital gains since 1971. 
There is no recapture on the transfer of these assets. The rule of thumb is to 
transfer at either zero or FMV. </p><h5>Transfers on Death</h5><p>On death there 
is no rollover for pre 1972 assets. They pass to a child at FMV. Such assets are 
not subject to recapture of capital cost allowance, but can incur a capital gain. 
Any capital gains on pre 1972 buildings would be eligible for the $750,000 capital 
gain exemption. </p><h4>Principal Residence</h4><h5>Transfers While Alive</h5><p>Generally 
a principal residence is deemed to transfer at FMV regardless of the sale price 
to the child. This is usually not a concern since a principal residence is exempt 
from capital gains. However since the cost to the child is the price they paid, 
it is to their advantage to have the transfer take place at either zero or FMV 
as Table 5 below illustrates.<br> </p><ul> <ol> <ol> <ol> <p align="center">Table

principal residence may also be eligible for the rollover and capital gains exemption 
if it is used principally in the farming business as described below.<sup>16</sup> 
</p><h5>Corporate Ownership of Residence</h5><p>A residence owned by a corporation 
is considered to be used principally for farming business if more than 50 per 
cent of its use is to accommodate persons, or their dependants, actively employed 
in the farming business. Furthermore, the residence must be provided to these 
persons in their capacity as employees rather than as shareholders, and the residence 
must be part of the business operation in that it provides accommodation for employees 
whose services may be required at virtually any time by virtue of the nature of 
the farming operations.<br> </p><h5><b>Life and Remainder Interest</b></h5><p>Obtain 
professional advise if an option being considered is to maintain a life interest 
in the farm house and transfer the remainder interest in that house to a child. 
This strategy can have unintended consequences for the child who receives the 
remainder interest. <br> </p><h5>Remainder Interest Transfer to Child</h5><p>On 
the death of the parent the child will have to report in their income the accrued 
capital gain that has occurred since their received the remainder interest. However 
they will not have the benefit of the principal residence exemption since the 
parents' house is not a principal residence to the child. This could be a significant 
amount if 10 or 15 years have passed. <br> </p><h5><b>Quota - Eligibile Capital 
Property</b></h5><p>The tax rules for buying and selling quota are complex. What 
follows is a review of how tax is calculated on the sale of quota, followed by 
a discussion of the implications of a transfer within the family.<br> </p><h5>Depreciating 
(Amortizing) Quota and the Cumulative Eligible Capital (CEC) account</h5><p>Quota 
is a type of property called eligible capital property. When quota is purchased 
three quarters (75 per cent) it is added to an account called the cumulative eligible 
capital account or CEC account. This account is used to determine the annual allowance 
for depreciation and to keep track of the quota that you buy and sell. <br> </p><p>Quota 
is depreciable at a rate of 7 per cent annually. The other one quarter of your 
quota purchase is non-depreciable. If you bought quota worth $100,000, $75,000 
(75 per cent) would be added to your cumulative eligible capital account, and 
depreciated at a rate of 7 per cent per year, on a declining basis. <br> </p><h5><b>Selling 
Quota </b></h5><p>The sale of quota can generate two types of taxable income:</p><ul> 
<ol> <li>the recapture of depreciation previously take</li><li>the increase in 
value over the original purchase price. While this is often called a capital gain, 
technically only &quot;capital property&quot; can generate a &quot;capital gain.&quot;</li></ol></ul><h5>Recapture</h5><p>Recapture 
on quota sales is similar to that of buildings, machinery and equipment. Recapture 
occurs when the cumulative eligible capital account falls below zero; a portion 
of the sale is recaptured and added to your income. <br> </p><h5>Increase in Value 
of Quota</h5><p>If the quota has appreciated, the increase in value can be reported 
in as either: (1) business income that is eligible for the capital gain exemption 
and as such is not subject to Alternate Minimum Tax (AMT); or (2) an election 
can be filed that deems the increase in the value of quota to be a capital gain 
similar to that on land or other non-depreciable capital property.<sup>17</sup> 
The use of the election results in the following:</p><ul> <ol> <ol> <li> AMT may 
be payable</li><li>a capital gains reserve can be created for proceeds of the 
sale that are not due until a future year or fiscal period</li><li>capital losses 
can be used to offset any capital gains on the quota</li></ol></ol></ul><p> The 
election can only be used where there is a recognized gains and not losses. A 
calculation can determine if the election would be advantageous or not. Table 
6 shows an example of a quota sale.</p><ul> <ol> <ol> <ol> <ol> <p align="center">Table

the example shown in Table 6, $20,000 of recapture is added to the farm income, 
plus the farming income as a result of the increase in the value of the quota. 
</p><p>The $4,000 pre-1988 depreciation adjustment occurs because in 1988, the 
capital gains inclusion rate was raised to 75 per cent from 50 per cent. Eligible 
Capital Property accounts were adjusted by 50 per cent to account for the change 
in the amount of quota that was now eligible to be depreciated.</p><p>Depreciation 
taken before 1988 however, was not recalculated, so an adjustment is required 
at the time of sale to reduce the income from the quota sale by 1/2 the pre-1988 
depreciation. This is depreciation that is allowed under the post 1988 rules. 
In this example, the depreciation taken before 1988 is $8,000, so the adjustment 
is $4,000, which is subtracted from the farming income from the quota sale. </p><hr width="100%"> 
<h4>Transfers While Alive </h4><p>Quota can be transferred to a child on a completely 
tax deferred basis or at any price up to FMV. The tax deferred price is based 
on the following formula (4/3 CEC) + 1971 Value, where the CEC is the cumulative 
eligible capital account and the 1971 value is the FMV quota holdings as of Dec 
31st 1971. This amount would represent the highest price that would trigger no 
income. A sale between this value and FMV would trigger some gain and possibly 
recapture. <br> </p><p>On the child's side there are potential reductions to the 
amount of the quota that can be added to the CEC and thus available for depreciation. 
These are</p><ul> <ol> <li>The 1971 values deducted by the parent reduce the deemed 
cost to the child.</li><li>If the parent used their capital gains exemption then 
the amount added to the child's CEC account is reduced by an amount equal to two 
times the capital gains deduction that was claimed by the parent.</li><li>Even 
where the capital gains deduction is not used or only partially used, the amount 
that can be added to the CEC account is restricted by the non-taxable portion 
of the capital gain. One half the difference between the taxable capital gain 
and any capital gain deduction claimed further reduces the amount of the addition 
to the cumulative eligible capital account.</li></ol></ul><p>These deductions 
are only relevant for determining the amounts allowed for additions to the cumulative 
eligible capital account. They do not affect the cost used for determining future 
capital gains. <br> </p><p>Table 7 illustrates the results of some alternative 
family sale prices. The examples assume that all quota was purchased after 1971 
and thus the 1971 value deduction is zero. The FMV is $600,000. The current CEC 
balance is $50,000 and $40,000 of depreciation has previously been taken, one 
half before 1988 and one half after 1987. The parent claims a capital gain exemption. 
<br> </p><p>There is no Alternative Minimum Tax calculation on quota if the election 
described above has not been taken.<br> </p><h4>Transfers on Death</h4><p>On death 
there is no opportunity to elect out of the rollover provisions. <sup>18</sup> 
While this means that the transfer takes place on a tax-deferred basis, it also 
means that on the final tax return the quota value cannot be bumped up to create 
a capital gain and utilize the parents' capital gain exemption. <br> </p><p>A 
rollover of quota is allowed to any beneficiary, not just children. The quota 
is deemed to transfer at four-thirds (4/3) of the undepreciated balance of the 
cumulative eligible capital account (CEC). This results in no income to the deceased 
person with the beneficiary taking the deceased person's place for future tax 
calculations. </p><ul> <ol> <ol> <ol> <ol> <p align="center">Table 7. Alternative

- Capital Property </h4><h5>Transfers While Alive</h5><p>Farmland can be transferred 
at any value between ACB and FMV, both before and after death. Because land usually 
appreciates in value parents often want to use their $750,000 capital gain exemption 
on the transfer. This strategy also benefits the child by giving them a higher 
ACB from which future capital gains are calculated. <br> </p><p>In order to trigger 
a capital gain a sale must occur. Since children often cannot afford the full 
FMV, one option is for the parent to sell the property at the FMV and hold a mortgage 
or note on the property. On death the outstanding debt is forgiven in the will. 
Forgiveness of debt outside of the will can have negative tax consequences and 
should be avoided. <br> </p><p>Table 8 illustrates the results of different family 
sale prices.<br> </p><h5>Transfers on Death</h5><p>On death farmland can be transferred 
on a rollover basis and all tax deferred, or at any price up to FMV. If the deceased 
parent has any capital gains exemption available, the transfer can take place 
at any value between the ACB and FMV in order to incur some capital gain and provide 
the child with a higher ACB. The alternative minimum tax (AMT) does not apply 
in the year of death. <br> </p><h5>Land Transfer Tax</h5><p>Land transfer tax 
is a tax levied by Ontario on the transfer of land that includes any buildings. 
Land transfer tax is normally based on the amount paid for the land, in addition 
to the amount remaining on any mortgage or debt assumed as part of the arrangement 
to buy the land.<br> The tax is levied on the consideration received and therefore 
gifts of land are not taxable. The tax rate is graduated, based on the transfer 
value. The example in Table 10 shows that the land transfer tax on a property 
transferred for $800,000 would be $10,475. <br> </p><blockquote> <ul> <ol> <ol>

from the land transfer tax are allowed on the transfer of farmed land to related 
individuals. To qualify the land must be used predominantly in farming by the 
individual or the related individuals prior to the transfer. The land must also 
be farmed by those family members after the transfer.<sup>19</sup> The exemptions 
are:</p><ul> <li>farmed land transferred to a related individual(s), which includes 
a spouse, child, grandchild, siblings, cousins, aunts and uncles and those related 
by marriage</li><li>farmed land transferred from the estate of a deceased individual 
to an individual(s) who would have qualified for the exemption had it been made 
by the deceased individual before his or her death </li><li>farmed land transferred 
to a family farm corporation</li><li> farmed land transferred from a family farm 
corporation to a related individual(s)</li></ul><p>There are circumstances where 
the exemption will not apply because the specific requirements for exemption have 
not been met. The exemption will not apply where: </p><ul> <li> the transfer is 
part of an arrangement to sell the shares of the transferee corporation to a third 
party </li><li> the transferee corporation does not continue the farming operation, 
but instead acts as a holding corporation, renting the land to the operating company. 
The transferee corporation must be the corporation that actually farms the land 
</li><li> where the transfer is to a related individual whose corporation farms 
the land. In this case the individual leases the land to his corporation and therefore 
does not farm the land himself</li></ul><h4>&nbsp;</h4><h4>Farm Family Partnerships 
and Corporations </h4><h5> Transfers While Alive</h5><p>The Income Tax Act also 
provides for the deferral of tax on the transfer of an interest in a family farm 
partnership and shares in a family farm corporation. Both of these structures 
are defined in the Act.<sup>20</sup> In order for the rollover provisions to apply 
the partnership or corporation must meet the specific requirements outlined in 
the Act. These are complex; contact your tax advisor well in advance of any planned 
transfer since adjustments can be made to bring a partnership or corporation in 
line with the definitions (which are a requirement for the rollover treatment), 
but this must be done in advance of any transfer. <br> </p><p>Like land, an interest 
in a family farm partnership and shares in a family farm corporation can be transferred 
at any value between ACB and FMV. This can occur either before or after death. 
Any capital gain generated can be offset by any available capital gains exemption. 
<br> </p>
            <p>Table 9 illustrates the results of alternative transfer prices. 
              When the capital gain exemption is available it can be beneficial 
              to sell an interest or shares at close to FMV to take advantage 
              of the capital gains exemption and have a higher ACB for the child. 
              This higher ACB would only be an advantage if the child sold the 
              shares and not the individual assets. The alternative minimum tax 
              may be a factor in some cases. For more information on partnerships 
              and corporations see OMAFRA factsheets Farm Corporations, Order 
              No. 01-057 and Farm Partnerships, Order No. 11-019. <br>
               </p><h5>Transfers on Death</h5><p>On death an interest 
in a family farm partnership and shares in a family farm corporation can be transferred 
at any value between ACB and FMV. The legal representative of the deceased may 
elect between the ACB and FMV in order to incur some gains and provide the child 
with a higher ACB at no tax cost to the estate if the $750,000 exemption remains. 
The alternative minimum tax (AMT) does not apply in the year of death.<br> </p><h5>Farm 
Business Transfer Example</h5><p>From the above discussion, it is clear various 
values can be used depending on the needs and desires of the family. Capital gains 
can be deferred or triggered, recapture deferred or the farm business transferred 
at a price the child can afford. While there is no single strategy, there are 
general approaches. </p><p>A common strategy might be:</p><ul> <li>transfer land 
between ACB and FMV. If the capital gains exemption is available the price is 
usually closer to the FMV</li><li>quota is transferred at a value that does not 
create any recapture or gain if no exemption is available. If capital gain exemption 
is available then a higher value might be used</li><li>depreciable assets purchased 
before 1972 (Part XVII) are transferred at fair market value or as a gift</li><li>personal 
residence is transferred at fair market value or as a gift</li><li>depreciable 
assets purchased after 1971 (Part XI) are transferred at or near undepreciated 
capital cost (UCC)</li></ul><p><br> <hr width="100%"> <p>The highest transfer 
price that allows maximum deferrals is the combination of land at ACB, quota at 
(4/3 CEC) - 1971 Value, Part XI assets at UCC, Part XVII assets at FMV and personal 
residence at FMV. <br> </p><hr width="100%"> <p>Tables 11 and 12 outline two transfer 
scenarios. Table 11 show a transfer at FMV with the use of the $750,000 capital 
gains exemption and no deferral of inventory income. Table 12 shows a transfer 
that minimizes tax and uses almost all the capital gains exemption by setting 
the price of the land at FMV. The quota price was not increased because of the 
fact that recapture would be generated. Of course a price between these scenarios 
could be chosen but taxable income would be generated. <br> <br> </p><ul> <ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote></ol></ul><h3><a name="sect8"></a>Section 8 - Reserves and 
Forgiveness of Debt</h3><h4>Capital Gains Reserves</h4><h5>What is a reserve?</h5><p>A 
reserve allows for a deferral in reporting either business income or taxable capital 
gains. It is allowed when all or part of the proceeds of the sale are not payable 
until after the end of the year in which the property is sold. A reserve is also 
available for quota, provided an election under section 14(1.01) of the Act is 
made. <br> Usually a mortgage or a note is sufficient evidence that an amount 
remains outstanding. However, a promissory note without restrictions as to when 
payment can be demanded represents &quot;absolute payment&quot; of the debt and 
in such a case, a reserve will not be allowed. The note should contain restrictions, 
such as payable 366 days after demand, to ensure that a reserve can be used. </p><p>A 
five-year reserve is allowed on dispositions to unrelated parties. A minimum of 
at least 20 per cent of the gain must be brought into income each year. </p><p>A 
10-year reserve is allowed on the disposition of land, depreciable property or 
a share in a family farm corporation or an interest in a family farm partnership 
to a child. Accordingly, a minimum of 10 per cent of the gain must be brought 
into income each year. <sup>21</sup></p><p>A reserve is not available to an individual 
who transfers property to a corporation that they control or did control or to 
a partnership in which they hold a majority interest.<sup>22</sup> A reserve is 
not available in the year of death.<sup>23</sup> </p><h5>Why use a reserve?</h5><p>There 
are several circumstances where a reserve might be useful. Firstly, if a large 
capital gain has been triggered, alternative minimum tax (AMT) may be payable 
even though the capital gains exemption is used. The use of a reserve could spread 
the gain over a number of years, reducing the possibility of paying AMT. As the 
capital gain is removed from the reserve, the capital gains exemption can be used. 
</p><p>The second circumstance is where the capital gains exemption is not available 
or has been fully used. Spreading the taxable capital gain over a number of taxation 
years may prevent income levels from reaching the higher tax brackets. It may 
also reduce the claw back of benefits and the possible application of the AMT.</p><h5>How 
is it calculated?</h5><p>The amount available for a reserve is the lesser of two 
amounts:</p><ul> <li>four-fifths of the gain in the year of sale (three-fifths, 
two-fifths, and one-fifth in years two, three and four) </li><li>amount payable 
at the end of the year divided by proceeds of the sale, multiplied by the capital 
gain<br> </li><ol> <blockquote> <p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote></ol></ul><h4>Forgiveness 
of Debt<sup>24</sup></h4><p><br> Forgiving the debt of a child while alive by 
way of a gift that reduces a note or mortgage, or any other indebtedness can result 
in negative tax consequences for the recipient. The results could include reductions 
in farm losses, net capital losses and restricted farm losses. If none of these 
are available for reduction then the ACB of the capital asset is reduced or 50 
per cent of the forgiven amount can be included in the income of the debtor. If 
a parent wants to gift money to a child while they are alive they should consult 
with their accountant about the best way to do that. Simply writing off of debt 
or an exchange of cheques should be avoided.</p><p>Forgiveness of debt in a will 
(by bequest) on the other hand does not have any of the negative tax consequences 
mentioned above. For example a parent might sell a piece of property to a child 
at FMV to trigger a capital gain which is offset by their capital gains exemption. 
The child may pay a portion of the debt while his parents remain alive and then 
the remaining amount is forgiven in the parent's will. </p><h3><a name="sect9"></a>Section 
9 - Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)</h3><p>Alternative Minimum Tax <sup>25</sup>(AMT) 
is a tax on dividends from Canadian corporations and capital gains. The AMT calculation 
is an alternative calculation of taxable income that includes the non-taxable 
part of the capital gain. The calculation shown in Table 13 uses the approach 
outlined in the Act, which includes a four-fifths (80 per cent) downward adjustment 
of the capital gain followed by the deduction of the taxable capital gain. A simplified 
approach is to include 30 per cent for the entire gain (30 per cent $500,000 = 
$150,000).</p><p>The AMT allows an exemption of $40,000, which means that the 
AMT has no effect until a gain of more than $133,333 is realized (the $133,333 
times 4/5 equals $106,666, which equals a taxable capital gain of $66,666 (133,000 
0.5) which when subtracted leaves $40,000, which is the amount of the exemption).</p><p>This 
amount can also be higher when the personal credits are used in the calculation. 
This alternative calculation is then compared to the regular tax calculation and, 
if it is higher, the additional amount is payable.</p><p>Any minimum tax paid 
can be carried forward up to seven years, and used as a credit against tax payable 
in those years.</p><p>Ontario also has an AMT, which is 40.33 per cent of the 
basic federal tax calculated under the AMT calculation. </p><ul> <ol> <blockquote>

The calculation for the alternative minimum tax adjusts the capital gain downward 
by multiplying the gain by 0.80. This is done because of the capital gain inclusion 
rate change from 75% to 50%. (30% of the total gain of 750k can be used to arrive 
at the untaxed capital gain upon which the AMT is applied)<br> <sup>2</sup>To 
calculate the regular tax payable, the 2008 federal tax rates were used. Federal 
tax rates are 15% on the first $37,885 and 22% on income between $37,886 and $75,769. 
A flat rate of 15% is used to calculate the federal minimum tax payable. <br> 
<sup>3</sup>To calculate the regular taxes payable 2008 provincial tax rates were 
used. Provincial tax rates are 6.05% on the first $36,020 and 9.15% on income 
between $36,021 and $72,041. Ontario surtaxes of $4,854 were added. A flat tax 
rate of 40.33% of the federal minimum tax less the federal tax of $6,150 is used 
to calculate the provincial minimum tax ((33,195-6,150) 40.33%). This is then 
added to the regular provincial tax to obtain the total for the minimum tax calculation. 
<br> <sup>4</sup>This tax calculation included federal and provincial basic personal 
tax credits and the CPP tax credit. CPP payments and the Ontario health tax were 
not included. </span></p><ul> <ol> <ol> <ol> <blockquote> <hr width="100%"> </blockquote></ol></ol></ol></ul><p>This
