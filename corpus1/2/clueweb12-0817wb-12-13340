    <div class="content clearfix">
      <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><p>Taxation in Spain occurs at a national level and at a regional (‘Autonomous Community’) or municipal level. The Spanish taxation system was subject to a significant review in 2007 that resulted in the introduction of a new Personal Income Tax Act. The tax regime in Spain is controlled by the Ministry of the Treasury.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Tax year</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>1st January to 31st December.</p><p><br><strong>Assessment Basis</strong> </p><p>Spanish residents are taxed on their worldwide income (earned and unearned), capital gains from all sources and on their worldwide assets. Spain operates a self-assessment regime. For personal income tax purposes, married couples may choose to file tax returns jointly or separately.</p><p><br><strong>Income Tax</strong> </p><p>Spanish residents are subject to Spanish Personal Income Tax (‘IRPF’). Individuals and couples benefit from personal allowances which reduce their liability to tax and which increase in line with the number of dependent children.</p><p>A new structure has been created for the taxation of income, which now falls into two categories: the general base and the savings base of income.</p><p><br>The general base includes salary and other benefits from employment, income from economic activities, and property rental income (either actual or deemed). Such income is reduced by applicable deductions and allowances. It is subject to a progressive scale which is applied to successive portions of taxable income with rates ranging from 24% to 43%*.</p><p>The savings base is subject to a 19% tax rate on savings income up to €6,000 and to 21% on the excess and includes interest, dividends, and capital gains/losses paid to residents in Spain, together with life and disability insurance proceeds paid to Spanish residents by a Spanish entity (or an EU insurer operating on a Freedom of Services passport into Spain) where any investment element is limited to Spanish tax compliant funds.</p><p><br>*Some Autonomous Communities have considered increasing the local personal income tax rates to help combat the economic crisis in Spain. The following maximum rates for personal income tax have been agreed for the 2011 tax year e.g. Andalucia: 48%; Asturias: 48.5%; Cataluna: 49%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Taxation of Investment Income</strong></p><p><br>Any investment income received will form part of the taxpayer’s income tax calculation and any withholding tax deducted will be held as a credit against the final calculation of income tax due.&nbsp; Spanish insurers and EU insurers with a Spanish branch or operating on a Freedom of Services passport in Spain are required to withhold 19% tax on gains on payments from tax compliant insurance policies held by Spanish residents. Foreign insurance policies will be subject to income<br>tax, and can offset losses, on an annual basis.&nbsp; Generally an annual exemption limited to €1,500 is granted to resident individuals in respect of all dividends.&nbsp; Premium Taxes Life insurance in Spain is exempt from premium taxes.</p><p><br><strong>Tax on Property Rental Income</strong></p><p>Property income (provided it is not used for economic activity) is taxed as general base income. The amounts received are the gross income and may be reduced by deducting all expenses necessary to service and repair the property. These can include interest on loans used to acquire the property, depreciation expenses of up to 3% of the purchase price or its cadastral value, excluding the value of the land. There are further reductions that can be made where the property<br>is destined to become the individual’s personal residence.</p><p><br><strong>Wealth Taxes</strong> </p><p>Wealth tax was technically abolished with effect from 1 January 2008. An allowance equal to 100% of the wealth tax due has been introduced and reporting obligations have been eliminated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Capital Gains Tax</strong> </p><p>Capital gains are included in the savings base. There are some capital gains exemptions e.g. the sale of the primary residence of the taxpayer is granted full or partial rollover relief, as are the capital gains for the sale of qualifying collective investments. Capital gains from investment funds are subject to a flat withholding tax of 19%, unless rollover relief applies.<br>Collective investments from jurisdictions included in the list of tax havens issued by the Spanish tax authorities are deemed to have a minimum net capital gain of 15% of the acquisition value unless otherwise proven.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Inheritance and Gift Tax</strong> </p><p>Inheritance and Gift Tax (IGT) is payable by the recipient of the assets at rates of between 7.65% and 34%. Residents are taxed on their worldwide assets and non-residents are only taxed on the assets and/or rights located in Spain.<br>The amount of tax paid depends upon the value of assets received. Tax rates are subject to a further multiplication factor (ranging from 0.5 to 1.4) based on the relationship of the recipient to the donor or deceased, and the existing wealth of the recipient. Different tax rates may apply in each Autonomous Community. </p><p>Various reductions to the tax base on inheritance apply and are dependent on the relationship between the recipient and the deceased and the age of the recipient. For example, where a recipient is a dependent child over the age of 13 but under 21 the taxable base is reduced by €15,956.87 and a further €3,990.72 for each year under 21 up to a maximum reduction of<br>€47,858.</p><p><br>No reduction is available for more distant relatives or unrelated parties. Additional reductions in each Autonomous Community may apply.&nbsp; </p><p><br>The Law also provides reductions to the taxable base for life insurance depending on where the policyholder dies, the inheritance of the habitual dwelling of the deceased and the inheritance and gift of assets and shares of a family business.<br>Although IGT is controlled by each Autonomous Community, there has been a general trend towards full or almost full exemption in recent years for Spanish resident taxpayers making transfers to descendents and spouses. These improvements may be extended to non-residents under pressure from the EU.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Regional and Municipal Taxes</strong></p><p><br>Inheritance and gift tax, capital and property transfer tax, as well as a proportion of income tax, are raised by the Autonomous Community/Region in which the taxpayer is resident.</p><p><br><strong>Property Taxes</strong> </p><p>An annual real estate tax is payable to the local municipality. The tax is based upon a percentage of the cadastral value of the property. The value is adjusted every 8 years. The rate varies from 0.4% and 1.1% on urban properties and 0.3% and 0.9% on rural properties. Municipalities may, within certain limits, increase or decrease these rates.&nbsp; If there is a change in land title, a municipal tax (‘land appreciation tax’ or ‘Plus Valia’) is raised based upon the increase in value of the land since it was last sold. The rate is set by the Municipality and varies depending upon the cadastral value and the length of time since the preceding transfer.</p><p><br><strong>Stamp Duty/Transfer Tax</strong> </p><p>The general rate of Stamp Duty/Transfer Tax is 0.5% rising to 1% in some autonomous regions and can reach up to 6% for property transactions. It is paid by the purchaser or the beneficiary of the transaction. No Stamp Duty applies if the transaction is subject to VAT.</p><p><br><strong>Sales Tax</strong> </p><p>Sales tax (IVA) of 18% is generally added to the sale price of goods. Some items are exempt from sales tax or are taxable at a reduced rate. ‘New build’ properties capable of being used as dwelling are subject to a sales tax of 8%, which is charged in place of a transfer tax.</p><p><br><strong>Social Security Contributions</strong></p><p><br>An employee is liable to pay social security contributions as a percentage of earnings. The rate is generally 4.7%, but contributions are capped at €3,198 for the year 2010. Compulsory social security contributions made are deductible from taxable income.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Taxation of expatriates living in Spain</strong></p><p><br>Expatriates living in Spain will be classified as either resident or non-resident. An individual is considered resident if:</p><ul><li>&nbsp;They spend more than 183 days in Spanish territory in a calendar year or,</li><li>&nbsp;Their principal place of business, professional or economic interest is based in Spain or,</li><li>&nbsp;Their spouse and/or dependent children are habitually resident in a Spanish territory (unless the individual is separatedfrom their family, or can prove tax residence elsewhere)</li></ul><p>In Spain there is no concept of a part tax-year. An individual will be considered to be resident or non-resident for the whole tax year according to the above rules and taxed accordingly.</p><p><br>Income tax is raised in two parts: the majority is raised by the central government, with a smaller percentage being raised at a<br>regional level by the ‘Autonomous Community’ in which the individual is living. The ‘Autonomous Communities’ also control<br>inheritance/gift tax rates. If the ‘Autonomous Community’ does not establish its own tax scales then a default tax scale is applied.</p><p><br>Income generated from employment for services rendered in a foreign country is tax exempt up to a limit of €60,100 (2010),<br>provided that the work is performed for a company or entity non-resident in Spain, or for a permanent establishment located in a foreign country and provided that a tax similar to the Spanish Personal Income Tax is applied in the territory where the work is performed. In addition, the territory must not be considered a ‘tax haven’ by the Spanish tax authorities. At present, the UK Dependent Territories of the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, as well as Bahrain, Hong Kong and Singapore, are all included on a ‘blacklist’ of tax havens maintained by the Spanish Tax Authorities.</p><p><br>International assignees moving to Spain, may, if certain conditions are met, choose to be taxed under the special taxation regime for expatriates described below.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Taxation of 'Non-Residents' living in Spain</strong></p><p><br>From 1st January 2004 individuals who acquire tax residence in Spain as a result of their transfer to Spain may opt to pay Non-Resident Income Tax in the tax period in which the change of residence takes place and for the following five tax years when the following conditions are met:</p><p><br>• The taxpayer cannot be considered tax resident in Spain in the 10 years prior to their assignment to Spain.</p><p><br>• Their transfer to Spain results from an employment contract. The individual needs to have a local contract with a Spanish<br>company. In case of a group of companies, an employee can maintain a home country employment contract and be<br>seconded to work for a Spanish entity.</p><p><br>• The work is effectively carried out in Spain. The work must be performed physically in Spain. This requirement will not be<br>met if the employee works out of Spain and the income related to the duties performed out of Spain exceeds 15% of their<br>annual employment income. In case of employees who work for other foreign entities of the group, the above percentage<br>will be 30%.</p><p><br>• The work is for a company or entity resident in Spain, or for a permanent establishment located in Spain of an entity not<br>resident in a Spanish territory.</p><p><br>• The earned income derived from the employment contract is not exempt from Non-Resident Income Tax.</p><p><br>Expatriates living in Spain who choose to be taxed under the Non-Resident Income Tax regime are taxed only on income and gains obtained or generated in a Spanish territory, compared to worldwide income and gains for residents. Non-residents may only file individual tax returns, unlike residents who may file joint returns in respect of a married couple.</p><p><br>The tax rates applicable to non-residents were amended with effect from 1st January 2007 in line with those applicable to residents.&nbsp; A non-resident does not normally benefit from tax free allowances/deductions but expenses can be deducted which relate directly to the generation of the taxable income for residents of other EU member states. However, certain exemptions may apply to nonresidents, in particular residents of other EU countries are not normally subject to Spanish tax on Spanish sourced interest income, or capital gains realised on the sale of certain personal property.</p><p><br>Property rental income, after the deduction of certain expenses, forms part of taxable income. Property which is not used for<br>rental or economic activity and is not the taxpayer’s permanent residence will be taxed on a deemed income basis at 2% based on cadastral value (equivalent to a rateable value in the UK).</p><p><br>With regard to capital gains arising from the transfer of real property from non-residents, the purchaser is required to withhold 3% of the agreed consideration. This amount is paid to the Spanish fiscal authorities on account against the seller’s potential liability to capital gains tax. In addition, dividends and interest are paid to non-residents net of withholding tax. </p><p>Dividends paid to nonresidents are exempt up to €1,500 pa, but withholding tax applies and a refund must be requested. The amount of the tax withheld will depend on the terms of any double taxation treaty with the payee’s country of residence. Spain has negotiated over 50 double taxation treaties.</p><p>Inheritance tax applies to non-residents only in receipt of assets and/or rights located in Spain, but many IGT exemptions are not applicable to non-residents. This position may alter following the issue of a ‘reasoned opinion’ by the European Commission requesting that Spain makes available the same exemptions to both Spanish residents and non-residents.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p><em></em></p><p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;"><em>Gerard Associates Ltd.

    <div class="content clearfix">
      <blockquote> <p><strong>Introduction </strong></p><p>Taxation in France is at a national level, although the taxes are calculated and the monies are collected by local tax offices. The tax regime in France is controlled by the Tax Administration.</p><p><br><strong>Tax Year</strong> </p><p>1st January to 31st December.</p><p><br><strong>Assessment Basis</strong> </p><p>French resident taxation is based upon worldwide income on a self assessment basis. In France, the family unit is taxed and, as a general rule, married couples cannot submit separate tax returns.&nbsp; The total amount of income tax, local property taxes assessed on the main household, as well as wealth tax and social surtaxes, is limited by the application of the ‘bouclier fiscal’ or tax shield, which prevents more than 50% of income being paid in tax.</p><p><br><strong>Income Tax</strong> </p><p>The main tax in France is the “impôt sur le revenu” and is payable on assessable income less allowable deductions. Assessable income includes income from employment, namely wages and salaries, as well as property income, industrial or commercial profits, certain directors’ remuneration, pensions and life annuities, non-commercial profits and investment income.</p><p><br>A French resident’s tax liability is determined through the ‘income splitting’ or ‘unit’ system, whereby the total taxable income of a family group is divided into a number of units (dependent on the number of family members). The calculated tax liability applicable to a single unit is then multiplied by the total number of units to arrive at the total amount of tax payable.</p><p><br>Tax is charged at progressive rates up to a maximum of 40% on all net taxable income.&nbsp; Employment income is taxable after deducting mandatory social security contributions and a standard allowance for professional expenses of 10% of taxable employment income or actual documented expenses. Some other expenses are either deducted from taxable income or allow a tax resident in France to reduce the amount of the tax payable. These deductions, tax reductions or tax credits are permitted for items such as pension contributions, alimony, major equipment expenses for sustainable development, charitable donations, child care and schooling expenses and domestic help expenses. Mortgage interest payable on the principal residency of the taxpayer<br>(loan concluded as of 6 May 2007) can be partially offset against personal income tax resulting<br>from the application of progressive tax rates.</p><p><br>From 1st January 2009 the reduction of French personal income tax due to tax deductions or credits is globally limited except in specific cases. The ceiling is currently €25,000 plus 10% net taxable income.&nbsp; French resident income tax is not deducted at source by the employer, but is payable in one instalment (first year) or either three or ten instalments over the following fiscal year.</p><p><br><strong>Taxation of Investment Income</strong></p><p><br>Generally, a French resident is liable to French income tax on investment income and is taxed at progressive rates. 60% of dividend income is taxable and resident individuals benefit from a tax free allowance of €1,525 for a single taxpayer and €3,050 for married taxpayers. as well as a credit of €115 or €230 in respect of dividends for single/married taxpayers.</p><p><br>For dividends and certain fixed return investments French tax residents may elect tax to be withheld at source at the time of receipt and not be subject to any further taxation (prélèvement libératoire). The flat tax is 18% plus special social surtaxes (i.e. a total of 30.1%).&nbsp; Income from capitalisation contracts (namely life assurance contracts under which accrued proceeds are compounded) concluded as from September 26, 1997 are subject, upon election, to the prélèvement libératoire at variable rates depending on the date of their conclusion: 35% if<br>less than four years, 15% between four and eight years and 7.5% if over eight years.</p><p><br><strong>Premium Taxes</strong> </p><p>Life insurance is exempt from premium taxes in France.</p><p><br><strong>Tax on Property Rental Income</strong></p><p><br>Rental income forms part of taxable income after deductions for various expenses such as repairs, property taxes etc or after a flat deduction. Rental losses are deductible up to a certain level from other forms of income and thereafter from rental gains only. Further tax breaks are available depending on the type of property leased.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Wealth Taxes </strong></p><p>A wealth tax applies to households whose net assets exceed €790,000 as at 1 January each year.&nbsp; French residents are taxed on their worldwide assets (unless otherwise provided by a tax treaty), whilst non-residents are taxed only on the value of their assets located in France (however, financial investment located in France are generally not taxable). Business assets, antiques and works of art are all exempt from wealth tax and a deduction of 30% of the value of the principal residence is granted. The rate levied is progressive, from 0.55% to 1.80%.&nbsp; With effect from 6 August 2008, an individual who has become a French resident after having<br>been a non-resident for at least five immediately preceding years is taxed only on his French-situ<br>assets for the first five years of residence.</p><p><br><strong>Capital Gains Tax </strong></p><p>Capital gains derived from the sale of a principal residence are tax-free and, if it amounts to less than €15,000 or has been owned for more than 15 years, the capital gain realised on the sale of a secondary residence is also tax-free. Gains above this level are subject to tax at a flat rate of 16%, increased to 28.1% by social taxes of 12.1% if French resident (see social security contributions below), after deducting various allowances which depend on the duration of ownership. Properties owned for more than 15 years are exempt from capital gains tax.&nbsp; </p><p>A tax free allowance of €25,830 (2010) exists for capital gains derived from the sale of shares and once this is breached the whole of the gain is liable to a fixed rate tax of 18% increased to 30.1% by the 12.1% social surtaxes (see social security contributions). Capital losses on the sale of shares are creditable against capital gains of the same nature. Losses can be carried forward for ten years.</p><p><br>Capital gains derived from the sale of shares in companies resident in France or another EEA country (except Liechtenstein) benefit from a progressive exemption after 5 years: one third of the gain is exempt after 6 years, two thirds after 7 years and the total gains are exempt after 8 years. The gains are still subject to 12.1% social surtaxes however.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Inheritance and Gift Tax</strong> </p><p>French inheritance or gift tax is payable by the beneficiaries of gifts or inheritances. If the deceased or the donor is a tax resident of France, tax will be due in France on worldwide assets transmitted. If the deceased or donor is not a tax resident of France, tax will be due on worldwide assets transmitted to the beneficiary, if the beneficiary has been a tax resident of France for at least six out of the last ten years. Tax will be due on all personal and real property located in France, regardless of whether the donor or beneficiary is tax resident of France.</p><p><br>Inheritance tax is levied on assets at their fair market value, with allowances taking into account the relationship between the deceased and the beneficiary. Debts existing at the time of death are deductible in full.&nbsp; No inheritance tax is due between spouses (or same sex partners of PACS) and for inheritance between brothers and sisters living together under specific conditions for deaths after 22nd August 2007.</p><p><br>The gift tax regime follows the same principles, but looks favourably on gifts made during the lifetime of the donor. Tax free allowances exist for transfers between parents or grandparents and children.&nbsp; The tax is levied at various rates ranging from 5% to 60%, depending on the relationship between the donor and the beneficiary and certain allowances. Reductions in the tax payable are available if certain conditions are satisfied.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Regional &amp; Municipal Taxes</strong></p><p><br>There are no regional or municipal taxes in France.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Property Taxes </strong></p><p>The owner of a property on 1st January pays the taxe fonciere. This is computed by applying certain coefficients determined annually by the local authorities to 50% of the notional rental value of the property as determined by the local land registry. Various exemptions and exclusions exist.&nbsp; A dwelling tax or taxe d'habitation is levied on any individual who occupies a dwelling on 1 January, even if they are not the owner or a French resident. The tax is assessed by multiplying the notional rental value of the dwelling as determined by the local land registry by coefficients determined by the local authorities. Various allowances are granted depending on the family<br>situation of the taxpayer.</p><p><br><strong>Sales Tax</strong> </p><p>Sales tax of 19.6% is generally added to the sale price of goods and services, including property less than 5 years old. Some sales are exempt from sales tax, or are taxable at a reduced rate of 5.5% or 2.1%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Stamp Duty/Transfer Tax</strong> </p><p>Registration duties are applied on the purchase of properties that are not subject to sales taxes.&nbsp; The duties are charged on the market value of the property, or purchase price if higher, at a rate of 5.09%. Other charges and notaries’ fees bring the cost of purchase to between 7% and 8% if financed by a mortgage.</p><p><br>Other registration duties apply when disposing of capital shares or common stock (3% capped at €5,000 for common stocks and certain capital shares) as well as the transfer duty and some fixed duties. Stamp duty has been abolished, but tax on certain credits has been introduced, ranging from €6 up to €54 depending on the amount of the credit facility.</p><p><br><strong>Social Security Contributions</strong></p><p><br>The French social security system comprises various social taxes providing a wide range of benefits, but the impact of these taxes is substantial. Social security contributions on employment income are shared between employer and employee, with employees on average contributing 15%. Contributions are assessed using various ceilings and the average rate will decrease as the gross salary increases. Social security contributions are fully deductible to determine net taxable employment income.</p><p><br>French tax residents are also liable to a Generalized Social Security tax (‘CSG’) and Contribution to the Reimbursement of the Social Debt (‘CRDS’) which are levied on 97% of employment income. The current rates are 7.5% for CSG (of which 5.1% is deductible) assessed on employment income and 6.6% on pensions and similar income, and 0.5% for CRDS.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Taxation of Expatriates Living in France</strong></p><p><br>An individual is deemed a French resident for tax purposes if:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>they have a home in France or, if they have no home in France or abroad, France is their principal place of abode; or</li><li>France is the place where they perform principal professional activities; or</li><li>France is the centre of their economic interests.</li></ul><p>Only one of these criteria needs to be met in order to qualify as a French resident for tax purposes. If an expatriate working in France is considered to be a resident in both France and in their home country, reference will be made to the relevant tax treaty, if any, to determine the country in which the individual will be regarded as resident. France has an extensive network of double taxation treaties, with over 110 negotiated and in place.<br>Allowances and annual progressive tax rates apply in the same way to part-year and full-year tax residents. However, because of French income-splitting rules, a married taxpayer with children may not reach the maximum marginal tax rate during their first year in France. This means that there may be a significant benefit to an expatriate in shifting income into the first year or last year of residency, depending on the date of arrival/departure. When a French tax resident leaves France during the course of a tax year, they remain liable to French personal income tax on the aggregate of world-wide income earned as a French tax resident and also their sole French-source income earned as a non-French tax resident, subject to the provisions of an applicable<br>tax treaty.</p><p><br>A new ‘inbound assignee’ regime came into force on 6th August 2008 (Article 155B of the French Tax Code) and is applicable to employees assigned to France by their foreign employer as from 1st January 2008 or to employees directly recruited abroad by a French company as from 1st January 2008. In both cases, the individuals must not have been French tax resident during the five calendar years preceding the year of starting their assignment/employment in France. Under this new regime, individuals assigned to France by their foreign employer can benefit from a French income tax exemption in relation to salary supplements connected with their assignment. For employees directly recruited abroad, the new regime would offer an option with regard to<br>their tax treatment as follows:</p><p><br>• the exemption of the actual amount of salary supplements received; or</p><p><br>• in the event that there are no such salary supplements, upon election, a flat rate exemption of 30% of the total<br>remuneration. </p><p>However, the new regime provides for a “floor” of reportable compensation (i.e. the taxable compensation cannot be lower than the taxable remuneration paid for a similar job in the same or a similar company established in France). It also provides for an exemption of part of the remuneration based on foreign workdays. However, the total exemption (i.e. on salary supplements – actual or not – and foreign workdays) is limited to 50% of the total remuneration, or the individual can elect for an exemption of French tax connected with foreign workdays limited to 20% of the taxable remuneration.&nbsp; The availability of this new inbound regime is limited to five years as from the year of arrival. Inbound assignees who benefit from the new inbound regime can also exempt 50% of the amount of their foreign interest, dividends, royalties, capital gains and industrial and intellectual property gains, under certain conditions</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Taxation of ‘Non-Residents’ Living in France</strong></p><p><br>If an individual is deemed to be a non-resident for tax purposes, they are subject to income tax on their French-sourced income only. However, a basic distinction is made depending on whether or not the non-resident taxpayer has a dwelling at his permanent disposal in France. If not, the general rule is that they are taxed exclusively on French-sourced income using the same income tax rates as residents. However, the rate must not be less than 20% of income, unless it can be proven that the overall rate of French tax on their worldwide income would be lower than 20%, in which case the tax liability is reduced accordingly. If the non-resident taxpayer has one or more dwellings in France, and subject to large exceptions, they are taxed on a deemed<br>income equal to three times the annual rental value of their residence(s). If their French-sourced income exceeds this deemed income, they are subject to tax on the basis of their French-sourced income. In general, this flat tax does not apply to residents of countries which have concluded a tax treaty with France.</p><p>Non-residents who are liable to French personal income tax on employment income are subject to withholding tax. Following deduction of the mandatory French employee social security contributions and the standard 10% salary deduction, employment income is then subject to withholding tax at source by the employer, at the rates of 0%, 12% and 20%. The withholding tax at 0% and 12% frees the corresponding portion of net annual salary from further income tax. The French complementary personal income tax is computed on the part of the remuneration liable in the 20% band. It is computed based on the French normal income tax rates, with a minimum of 20%. If the resulting tax is lower than the withholding tax already paid at a rate of 20%, the total withholding tax is the final tax liability of the employee. If the resulting tax is higher than the 20% withholding tax, the 20% withholding tax levied by the employer is offset but an additional income tax is due by the employee.</p><p>In respect of social security contributions, France has entered into agreements with more than 40 countries. Under these agreements, where expatriates are temporarily transferred to France, they may remain under their home country’s social security schemes.</p> </blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>&nbsp;</em></p><p><em></em></p><p style="padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0.5em; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px;"><em>Gerard Associates Ltd.
