&quot;The diaries and writings of five women of the tri-state area, 
Where West Virginia, Kentucky, and Ohio meet, reveal a broader 
perspective on the Civil War and women. The women of this region 
separated only by the Ohio River, shared much in their lives: 
shopping in Cincinnati, reading Cincinnati newspapers, traveling 
the Ohio by steamer and having friends and relatives living 
close-by. But the Civil War shattered their commonality. Ohio 
became a Union state, Kentucky a war-torn border state, and West 
Virginia a newly created Union state. To what extent did the 
Civil War intrude upon the lives of women of this region? Did 
their lives become as diverse as the political paths of their 
home states? An examination of the diaries and letters of these 
women should provide answers to these questions.&quot; </i></b>Very

the play Uncle Tom's Cabin. Civil War period music includes songs 
about African-American soldiers and the plight of the newly 
emancipated slave. Post-Civil War music reflects the problems of 
Reconstruction and the beginnings of urbanization and the 
northern migration of African Americans. African-American popular 
composers include James Bland, Ernest Hogan, Bob Cole, James 
Reese Europe, and Will Marion Cook. Twentieth century titles 
feature many photographs of African-American musical performers, 
often in costume. Unlike many other sorts of published works, 
sheet music can be produced rapidly in response to an event or 
public interest, and thus is a source of relatively unmediated 
and unrevised perspectives on quickly changing events and public 
attitudes. Particularly significant in this collection are the 
visual depictions of African Americans which provide much 
information about racial attitudes over the course of the 
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.&quot; </i></b>You can browse

<p>AMERICA SINGING: NINETEENTH CENTURY SONG SHEETS

&quot;For most of the nineteenth century, before the advent of 
phonograph and radio technologies, Americans learned the latest 
songs from printed song sheets. Not to be confused with sheet 
music, song sheets are single printed sheets, usually six by 
eight inches, with lyrics but no music. These were new songs 
being sung in music halls or new lyrics to familiar songs, like 
&quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; or &quot;The Last Rose of Summer.&quot; Some of America's 
most beloved tunes were printed as song sheets, including &quot;The 
Star Spangled Banner&quot; and &quot;Battle Hymn of the Republic.&quot; Song 
sheets are an early example of a mass medium and today they offer 
a unique perspective on the political, social, and economic life 
of the time, especially during the Civil War. Some were dramatic, 
some were humorous; all of them had America joining together in 
song. The Rare Book and Special Collections Division of the 
Library of Congress holds 4291 song sheets. Included among these 
American songs are ninety-seven British song sheets from Dublin 
and London. The collection spans the period from the turn of the 
nineteenth century to the 1880s, although a majority of the song 
sheets were published during the height of the craze, from the 
1850s to the 1870s.&quot; </i></b>Good</p>

&quot;Band Music from the Civil War Era makes available examples of a

children's books. And as with war memorials, the debate over the 
Confederate battle flag, and other forms of popular and material 
culture associated with the war, children's books are less a 
recitation of particular historical events than they are a 
revelation of the modes of thinking that exist during the time of

&quot;The unique path which Walt Whitman followed during the American 
Civil War (1861-1865) led to an insightful, poetic record which 
captures the turmoil of this era on an intimate level. Like all 
transformational events in history one must examine the 
literature of the time to reach an understanding of the day- 
to-day effects on common people. Unlike other wars, no major 
author was a military participant in the Civil War. Yet there 
were authors who had personal interaction with soldiers and 
experienced important events of the war. Herman Melville went on 
scouting rides in order to get a glimpse of the soldier's 
lifestyle before writing his Battle Pieces and Aspects of War. 
Louisa May Alcott published Hospital Sketches (1863) after a 
brief time as nurse during December 1862 and January 1863. Her 
work was cut short when she became ill with typhoid fever and 
returned home. <br>
Besides firsthand diaries of soldiers, the most poignant scenes 
of the Civil War come from Walt Whitman's wartime prose and most 
distinctly his book of poetry entitled Drum Taps (1865) Many of 
its poems resulted from his years in Washington, D.C., spent as a 
psychological nurse to sick and wounded soldiers. Whitman wrote 
to a friend in 1863, &quot;The doctors tell me I supply the patients 
with a medicine which all their drugs &amp; bottles &amp; powders are 
helpless to yield&quot; in reference to the aid of his cheerful 
disposition and careful attention to the welfare of the 
soldiers.&quot; </i></b>Includes photos of wartime hospitals. Good</p>

</b>A lesson plan on Abraham Lincoln for high school students.<b>
<i>&quot;Slavery played a prominent role in America’s political, 
social, and economic history in the antebellum era. The South’s 
&quot;peculiar institution&quot; was at the forefront of discussions 
ranging from the future of the nation’s economy to Western 
expansion and the admission of new states into the Union. The 
public discourse in the first half of the nineteenth century 
exposed the nation’s ambivalence about slavery and race. 
Politicians were increasingly pressured to make their opinions 
known, and Abraham Lincoln was no exception.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; </i></b>

time period. Excellent</p>

&nbsp;Many times when teachers approach this period in American 
history, the only discussion of African Americans is usually 
slave life on a plantation with escape to the Underground 
Railroad. Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Dred Scott and a 
few other known figures are emphasized, but this is telling only 
part of the story of African Americans.&nbsp; Although there were 
over three million slaves in the South at the beginning of the 
Civil War, there were hundreds of thousands of free blacks whose 
story goes untold. These free blacks, along with skilled slaves 
who were hired out, maintained businesses and supported their 
families.<br>
Our Lesson Plan will identify some figures for additional 
research and serve as a guide on how to research these 
&quot;unknowns,&quot; both slave and free, to get a broader understanding 
of African American living and working environment between 1800 
and 1870. It is our desire that teachers in each state will 
search out additional names of people from their own communities 
or states to encourage students to learn more about their local 
history. The research skills that students acquire, especially 
with primary sources, special reference works, archival 
materials, historic sites, and interviews with experts can be 
applied to other history and humanities assignments.&quot; </i></b>

&quot;This lesson uses images and texts selected from the American 
Memory collections of the Library of Congress to engage students 
in studying the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition of 1876. Its 
central topic is the question of what items and images of the 
Exposition said about America. Students examine other images from 
the era to see the Exposition in the context of its time, and 
work as historians using primary source images and documents to 
construct museum exhibits on the issues of the Centennial Era.<br>

Proclamation.<b> <i>&quot;While the Civil War began as a war to 
restore the Union, not to end slavery, by 1862 President Abraham 
Lincoln came to believe that he could save the Union only by 
broadening the goals of the war. The Emancipation Proclamation is 
generally regarded as marking this sharp change in the goals of 
Lincoln's war policy. Under his authority as the Commander in 
Chief, President Lincoln proclaimed the emancipation, or freeing, 
of the enslaved African Americans living in the states of the 
Confederacy which were in rebellion. <br>
The Proclamation was, in the words of Frederick Douglass, &quot;the 
first step on the part of the nation in its departure from the 
thralldom of the ages.&quot; Through examination of the original 
document, related writings of Lincoln as well as little known

</b>A curriculum unit for grades 9-12 on the time period before 
the Civil War<b>. <i>&quot;In this unit, students will trace the 
development of sectionalism in the United States as it was driven 
by the growing dependence upon, and defense of, black slavery in 
the southern states. Initially seen as contrary to freedom but 
tolerated in order to produce the U.S. Constitution, by the 1830s 
the &quot;peculiar institution&quot; found advocates who saw it as a 
&quot;positive good.&quot; Its expansion into Missouri, southern outrage 
over federal tariffs, and westward expansion into new territory 
produced a volatile and persistent debate over slavery that 
increasingly threatened to divide the American union. By 1860, 
the nation found an old Democratic Party split over the right to 
extend slavery into federal territory, and a new Republican Party 
nominating an anti-slavery, though not abolitionist, president. 
When Abraham Lincoln's election produced no national consensus to 
settle the matter of slavery's future, a southern &quot;secession&quot; 
sealed the fate of the Union. <br>
What characterized the debates over American slavery and the 
power of the federal government for the first half of the 19th 
century? How did regional economies and political events produce 
a widening split between free and slaveholding states in 
antebellum America? Who were the key figures and what were their 
arguments regarding the legitimacy of slavery and the proper role 
of the national government in resolving its future in the 
American republic? This unit of study will equip students to 
answer these questions through the use of interactive maps, 
primary texts, and comparative biographies.&quot; </i></b>Excellent</p>

that contest was President Abraham Lincoln, who had the arduous 
task of steering this nation through the war and also the more 
difficult challenge of determining a course for peace and 
Reconstruction. As war leader and peacemaker, he faced criticism

</b>A lesson plan for elementary students on Lincoln’s 
assassination.<b> <i>&quot;Fourth grade students often associate 
Abraham Lincoln with three things: He wore a tall hat, he issued 
the Emancipation Proclamation, and he was assassinated. The 
murder of Lincoln, whom most historians consider one of the 
country’s two most important presidents, had major consequences 
for our nation and for the Reconstruction period that followed 
the Civil War. <br>
John Wilkes Booth’s premeditated attack was a carefully 
orchestrated plot involving at least eight other participants. 
The fact that President Lincoln was shot while enjoying a show at 
Ford’s Theater on April 14, 1865 leaves students wondering how it 
could have happened. A week earlier General Lee had surrendered 
to General Grant. The nation was finally looking forward to 
peace. Yet out of the shadows came Booth to kill the president, 
while one of his conspirators attempted to murder the secretary 
of state. <br>
Students exploring this type of turning point in American history 
are frequently frustrated by a lack of understanding of the 
event. While comprehensive answers may never be available to 
explain how these crimes could have taken place, we can examine 
the circumstances surrounding them to gather a partial 
understanding of why they happened.<br>
Abraham Lincoln’s assassination was yet another wound that our 
country suffered due to the &quot;peculiar institution&quot; of slavery. In 
studying the Civil War, students will discover that slavery was 
at the core of the conflict that tore our nation apart and that 
ultimately killed the sixteenth president. States’ rights, while 
often cited as the reason why Southern states seceded, masked the 
political and moral arguments over slavery. Lincoln’s legacy, the 
abolition of slavery in the United States, was also the cause of 
his death.&quot; </i></b>Students examine primary documents to learn 
what brought about Lincoln’s assassination. Excellent</p>

keep a personal journal. Your journal will record what is 
happening to you and those around you. You will provide details,

<i>&quot;President Abraham Lincoln has invited you to Washington D.C. 
to debate the future of our country before Congress. <br>
The question that is now before our divided nation is:&nbsp; Why, 
when we worked and fought side by side almost 100 years ago to 
create a country of our own, are we fighting each other?&nbsp; 
What has brought us here?&nbsp; As in any conflict we need to 
understand why we are at this point and how we can move forward 
as one nation. Only by understanding each region’s viewpoints and 
talking the problems over can we, as a nation, begin to heal and 
put this nation back together as the founding fathers intended us 
to be.&quot; &quot;<font FACE="Cooper Lt BT">You will work in groups to 
create a PowerPoint presentation from the point of view of one of 
the following:&nbsp; Northerner,&nbsp; Slave,&nbsp; or a 
Southerner.&nbsp; Each team member is to research and present 
information that will help others recognize your point of view.&nbsp; 
The information will then lead to a debate with all three sides 
presenting information as they communicate the cost of peace vs. 
the cost of war.</font>”<font FACE="Cooper Lt BT"> </font></i></b>

<p style="margin: 0 0in">A webquest for junior/senior high 
students on the Civil War<b>. &nbsp;<i>“Dear Citizen of the United 
States of America, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you know, yesterday, the Confederates 
attacked Fort Sumter in South Carolina [our first state to secede 
our nation] which was held by the Union troops. &nbsp; Our new country 
has been suffering many conflicts in the past years.&nbsp; </i></p>
<p style="margin: 0 0in"><i>&nbsp;There were three main conflicts.&nbsp; 
The first conflict was about the taxes being charged on incoming 
goods called tariffs about thirty years ago.&nbsp; The Tariff Act was 
passed on European goods to encourage the South to buy the 
North's products.&nbsp;&nbsp; Southerners didn't like having to choose 
between paying high taxes on imported goods or paying the high 
prices on goods that the North made. Although the taxes have 
changed, Southerners remember how the North treated them.&nbsp;&nbsp; </i>
</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0in"><i>&nbsp;The second conflict dealt with 
politics.&nbsp; After centering our government in Washington D. C., 
the North was gaining more power as their populations increased.&nbsp; 
The Southerners decided that this was not fair.&nbsp; In order for 
fairness to exist for all states, the South thought it would be 
reasonable if each state created their own set of laws.&nbsp; They 
call it &quot;States'&nbsp; Rights&quot;.&nbsp; </i></p>
<p style="margin: 0 0in"><i>&nbsp;The last quarrel that you have 
probably been hearing a lot about lately, is the issue of 
slavery.&nbsp; You have seen how big the cotton plantations are in the 
South.&nbsp; Southerners need a lot of field hands to help produce the 
main crop of cotton.&nbsp; They also need their slaves to perform 
household chores while they are overseeing their plantations.&nbsp; 
With this cheap or free labor, the Southerners easily make a 
profit.&nbsp;&nbsp; After all, slavery has been a part of their way of life 
for well over 200 years.&nbsp; On the other side of the coin, the 
North does not approve of Southerners owning slaves.&nbsp; Slaves are 
humans. Humans aren't supposed to own other humans. They think 
this is terribly wrong. &nbsp; The South doesn't like the North 
telling them what they can and cannot do. &nbsp; The constitution 
guaranteed the right to own property and protected against 
seizure of property. To a Southerner, a slave is property.</i></p>
