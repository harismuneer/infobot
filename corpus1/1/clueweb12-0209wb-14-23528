<table bgcolor="#cfcfcf" border="0" width="100%" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0">
<tr><td>
The beginning of a war was inevitable when:

<p align=justify><a href="majorcw.html#six"></a>
In December, 1860 and January, 1861 six Southern states</a>, led by South Carolina, seceded from the Union. On March 2, 1861 Texas joined them. The argument was over states rights. Specifically, whether the Federal Government had powers to interfere with the right to own and trade property. Slave states considered slaves as property, therefore, at issue was the right to enforce warrants and recapture runaway slaves.

<p align=justify>
Great compromises had been reached in the drafting of the Constitution. <a href="../const/constitution.html#sec2">Article I</a>, Section 2, recognized that slavery existed and provided for a fractional head count being used as the basis for determining representation in congress. <a href="../const/constitution.html#sec9">Article I</a>, Section 9, gave congress the power to enact laws restricting or forbidding <i>importation</i> of slaves after 1808 but the Constitution did not give congress specific power to interfere with ownership of slaves in those states which allowed ownership when the Constitution was adopted.

<p align=justify>
The Constitution did, however, give congress powers to make laws in territories of the United States, notwithstanding the Supreme Court's decision in <a href="dredscott.html">Dred Scott,</a> and to admit new states to the Union. Congress, especially the Republicans, had become proactive in abolishing slavery in territories and failing to admit states which were not "free states." The South viewed the territories as economic opportunities for the sale of slaves and saw the Federal activity as an encroachment into their rights.

<a name="sumter"></a>
<p align=justify>
On March 4, 1861, Abraham Lincoln, a Republican, was inaugurated. Lincoln had not given any indication that he was opposed to slavery within those states where it was legal under the Constitution. He had, however, given several signals that he regarded secession as illegal: not permitted by the Constitution. He had further indicated that he would not recognize secessionist decrees and would continue enforcement of Federal law everywhere within the United States. The South bitterly opposed to his election.

<p align=justify>
Lincoln, to assert his concept of federal authority, sent ships into Charleston harbor, South Carolina, to supply the U.S. Army post of Fort Sumter and to assure that the United States Flag flew over the fort.

<p align=justify>
On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces under General Pierre G. T. Beauregard attacked Fort Sumter. The Union troops surrendered on April 13 and evacuated the fort the next day.

<p>
Just after April 15 <a href="majorcw.html#four">four more states</a> seceded.

<p align=justify>
Lincoln considered this was an act of war, not just secession, and he acted. Popular thinking was that the Union Army could put down the "rebellion" in as little as three months.

<p align=justify>
The coming conflict would evolve into three sectors (theaters) of operation. The Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River divided the country into:

<p>
The Eastern theater -- the area east of the mountains to the Atlantic Ocean.

<p>
The Western theater -- between the mountains and the Mississippi River.

<p align=justify>
The West -- west of the Mississippi. This area saw very little action and except for Texas, was generally under the control of the North.

<p align=justify>
Many Civil War battles have two names because the Confederates named battles after the nearest settlement, and the North used the nearest body of water. In the following tables the Northern name is given first, followed by the Confederate name. When only one name appears it is the name both sides used.

<tr><td colspan="6"><p align=justify>First Battle of Bull Run (or First Battle of Manassas). Part of the Union army, a force of about 18,000 men under General Robert Patterson had moved to secure the northern end of the Shenandoah Valley, Virginia. Another Union force of about 31,000 under General Irvin McDowell had moved into eastern Virginia along a creek called Bull Run near Manassas, about 25 miles west of Washington, D.C.

<p align=justify>
A Confederate army under Beauregard faced McDowell at Manassas while General Joseph E. Johnston commanded Confederate troops in the Shenandoah Valley. Those forces, along with other scattered troops, added up to about 35,000 Confederates.

<p align=justify>
In July 1861, McDowell approached Manassas. McDowell thought his troops could destroy Beauregard's forces while the Union troops in the Shenandoah Valley kept Johnston occupied. But just before the battle Johnston slipped away and traveled by rail to join Beauregard.

<p align=justify>
The opposing forces, both composed mainly of poorly trained volunteers, clashed on July 21. The North launched several assaults. During one attack, the Confederate General Thomas J. Jackson stood his ground so firmly that he received the nickname "Stonewall." After halting several assaults, Beauregard counterattacked and the tired Union forces fled toward Washington in wild retreat. After the battle, some Southerners regretted not moving on to capture Washington but such an attempt would probably have failed.

<p align=justify>
The North now realized that it faced a long fight and that the war would not be over in three months. Confederate confidence in final victory soared and remained high for the next two years.

General Halleck had become commander of most Union forces from Ohio to Kansas. He ordered Grant with some 40,000 men to move down the Tennessee River and to wait for Buell to join him. Grant moved to Pittsburg Landing, Tenn., a village about 20 miles north of Corinth. The Confederate co-commanders, Johnston and Beauregard, decided to strike Grant with their army of some 44,000 troops before Buell arrived. The Confederate troops surprised and almost smashed Grant but Grant held his lines and Johnston was killed.

<p align=justify>
The next day, Grant received about 25,000 reinforcements, including some 18,000 troops led by Buell. The Confederate army received only about 700 reinforcements.  Grant now used his much larger army to force a Southern retreat to Corinth. By June the Union had control of the Mississippi River all the way to Memphis.

<p>
In December 1860, South Carolina became the first state to secede.

<p align=justify>
Five other states: Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia and Louisiana followed in January 1861.

<p align=justify>
Organization of a government for the Confederacy began on Feb. 4, 1861, when delegates from the six states that had seceded met at Montgomery, Alabama, and set up a temporary government. Jefferson Davis of Mississippi was elected president of the Confederacy, and Alexander H. Stephens of Georgia was chosen vice president.  Both were to serve for one year. After the adoption of a permanent constitution, they were elected to six-year terms. Six prominent Southerners became members of the first Cabinet, and Montgomery was named the temporary capital.

<p align=justify>
John Tyler, the 10th President of the United States (1841-1845), accepted appointment to the Congress of the Confederate States of America but died at his home in Virginia before the first meeting was held.

<p>
Cabinet of the Confederate States:

<pre>
Secretary of State...........  Robert Toombs (1861)
                               Robert M. T. Hunter (1861)
                               Judah P. Benjamin (1862)
Secretary of the Treasury....  Christopher Memminger (1861)
                               George A. Trenholm (1864)

                               Judah P. Benjamin (1861)
                               George W. Randolph (1862)
                               Gustavus Smith (Acting) (1862)
                               James A. Seddon (1862)
                               John C. Breckinridge (1865)

<p>
In March, 1861 Texas joined the Confederacy.

<p>
Lincoln was inaugurated two days later; March 4, 1861.
<a name="four"></a>

<p align=justify>
Soon after April 15, 1861: Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina, and Tennessee joined the Confederacy.

<p align=justify>
After Virginia seceded, the Confederate Congress voted on May 21, 1861, to move its capital to Richmond. The move was accomplished on May 29.

<p align=justify>
The Constitution of the Confederacy, adopted in March 1861, was modeled after the United States Constitution but it contained six important differences:

<p align=justify>
1. The president's and vice president's terms were six years.  The president could not serve successive terms.

<p align=justify>
2. Cabinet members received seats in Congress and had the privilege of debate but they could not vote.

<p>
3. Foreign slave trade was ended, but not slavery.

<p align=justify>
4. Congress was forbidden to make appropriations for internal improvements, to levy a protective tariff, or to give bounties.

<p align=justify>
5. A two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress was necessary to admit a new state into the Confederacy or to make appropriations not requested by the heads of departments through the president.

<p align=justify>
6. The president could veto single items in appropriation bills (line item veto).
<p align=justify>
The Confederate States hoped for a peaceful withdrawal from the Union. A number of people in the Confederacy and in the Union worked hard to avoid war but their efforts failed, and war began with the attack on Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861.

<p><center>
                    <b>How the states lined up</b>
<p>
<img src="../images/mapus.jpg">
</center>

<p align=justify>
Eleven states fought for the Confederacy. They were Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia.

<p align=justify>
Twenty-three states fought for the North. They were California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Wisconsin.

<p align=justify>
The territories of Colorado, Dakota, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, and Washington also fought for the Union.

<p align=justify>
Each side included slave states that lay on either side of the border between the North and the Deep South. When the war began, both the Union and the Confederacy made strong efforts to gain their support. North Carolina, Virginia, Arkansas, and Tennessee joined the Confederacy. Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri stayed in the Union. The western counties of Virginia seceded from the South later in the war, and in 1863 formed the state of West Virginia.

<p align=justify>
Secessionist groups set up separate state governments in both Kentucky and Missouri, even though those states stayed in the Union. Those groups also sent delegates to the Confederate Congress which accounts for the 13 stars in the Confederate flag even though only 11 states actually joined the Confederacy.

<p align=justify>
Some people in border states supported the North, but others believed in the Southern cause. The heaviest fighting of the war occurred in the border states.  

<p align=justify>
Border states on the Southern side were Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas.

<p align=justify>
Border states that supported the North were Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri.
