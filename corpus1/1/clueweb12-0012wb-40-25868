Isn't it peculiar that the same pundits and beneficiaries of public largesse are seldom, if ever, heard commenting on the pain taxpayers are feeling when they are forced to cough up the money to fund programs and when their wallets are tapped even further to meet the spending demands of special interests? </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>No, it is always those whose gravy train is threatened who scream the loudest. Why is that?&nbsp; It's a classic case of public choice theory. When the benefits of government spending are concentrated, as is the case with teacher unions, a decline in spending is felt more acutely than the pain of higher tax revenue spread over the entire population of taxpayers, many of whom have been convinced that tax hikes are a good thing. Then too, because so many special interest group members and their families and friends are also taxpayers, the ability of taxpayers to present a united opposition to tax hikes is even more difficult. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, the beneficiaries often present a more strenuous opposition to spending cuts than the opposition taxpayers are able to mount against tax increases. Only by electing a majority of people who are fervently committed to resisting the massive pressure from many powerful groups to raise spending and taxes can the taxpayers ever have a fighting chance.&nbsp; Apparently, that is the case in Harrisburg right now. And that is driving the special interests nuts. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Will the current favorable situation last beyond the next election?&nbsp; One can hope. </p>

The state has antiquated and seriously inadequate laws regarding property assessments, it faces enormous future government spending to keep its pension promises to teachers and state employees, it is a perennial leader among the states in teacher strikes, it is one of two states that still owns liquor stores, one of the state's two largest transit agencies is in undeclared bankruptcy, and its bridges and roads are ranked among the worst in the nation.&nbsp; </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, Wisconsin and Indiana have passed legislation that dramatically curtails the power of unions and their ability to drive jobs away and raise the cost of government. Neither state allows teacher strikes and in the case of Indiana has greatly expanded a voucher program to allow students choices other than failing public schools. Two things Pennsylvania has notably been unable to get done or in the case of banning teacher strikes has not come close to doing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, while we can congratulate ourselves for Marcellus related jobs and incomes gains and laud the powerful growth in education and health employment, it must be remembered that the extent of the state's dependence on education and health for jobs cannot be the basis for sustained, long term economic health.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Pennsylvania must address the pension crisis, the teacher and transit worker right to strike, the state of transportation infrastructure and continue its recent efforts to contain the spending that grew so profusely under the previous administration.&nbsp; And if it really wants to get bold, it could eliminate the dues withholding for public sector employees and begin to talk seriously about doing with prevailing wage requirements on public construction projects.&nbsp; But in a state that cannot even get itself out of the liquor selling business, the much desired reforms enumerated here are probably best regarded as fantasies. &nbsp;</p>

Stability and predictability were two themes the Supreme Court considered before tossing out Allegheny County's base year plan, uniformity trumping both.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />With two &quot;real world&quot; examples-the current assessments of both homes mentioned in the piece are available on the respective real estate websites for both <a href="http://www.alleghenycounty.us/">Allegheny</a> and <a href="http://maps.co.butler.pa.us/viewer.htm">Butler</a> counties-we can see how the current millage rates (2012 for county and municipal, 2011-12 for schools) of each county and the municipality and the school district affect each home.&nbsp; Keep in mind that neither property has been officially reassessed in some time (home #1 since 2002, home #2 since 1969) though home #1 should be getting a reassessment notice in the coming months.&nbsp; </p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td width="638" valign="top"><p><em>Home #1-Allegheny County, Pine Township, Pine Richland School District</em></p><p>Current assessed value: $391,900 ($376,900 for County tax purposes after applying homestead exemption, and according to the PA Department of Education the average home in the school district received $200 off school taxes as a result of Act 1 gaming refunds [also a homestead exemption])</p><p>County Taxes: $376,900 x 4.69 mills = $1,763</p><p>Municipal Taxes: $391,000 x 1.2 mills = $469</p><p>School Taxes: $391,000 x 21.9084 mills = $8,566 (less $200 from Act 1) = $8,366</p><p>Total: $10,598</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Home #2-Butler County, Cranberry Township, Seneca Valley School District</em><br />Current assessed value: $55,480 (no County homestead exemption, and the PA Department of Education puts the average Act 1 tax reduction for a homestead in Seneca Valley School District at $100)</p><p>County Taxes: $55,480 x 23.63 = $1,299</p><p>Municipal Taxes: $55,480 x 13 = $715</p><p>School Taxes: $55,480 x 105.60 = $5,808 (less $100 from Act 1) = $5,708</p><p>Total: $7,722</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p>The Allegheny County home is paying $3,000 more in taxes as a result of a higher County tax bill ($464) and a higher school tax bill ($2,758).&nbsp; The Butler County home is paying more to the municipality than their neighbor.&nbsp; Both are paying more than 75% of their total tax bill to fund public education.&nbsp; </p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">So obviously the Butler County home, according to the County Executive, must be free from worry about their taxes.&nbsp; A quick look back to 2005-that's when Allegheny County adopted its base year-shows that <a href="http://www.co.butler.pa.us/butler/lib/butler/control/Butler_CAFR_2010.pdf">Butler County</a> increased its taxes then cut them in 2009 after a change to the predetermined ratio; Cranberry increased its taxes this year, and Seneca Valley school district had increases in 2006, 2007, 2010 and 2011.&nbsp; It is planning an increase for the coming school year according to its preliminary 2012-13 budget.</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Just down the street in <a href="http://www.alleghenycounty.us/controll/cafr2010.pdf">Allegheny County</a>, home #1 will see a higher County tax bill this year as a result of the millage hike; his municipal taxes have not changed since 2005; and his school tax bill went up in 2010 and is expected to go up again according to the preliminary 2012-13 budget.&nbsp; Home #1 might see a tax cut when rates rolled back once the windfall provisions are applied and the new values go into effect.&nbsp; </p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">Can we once and for all stop the talk that reassessments lead to tax increases?&nbsp; There is enough hard evidence of tax increases happening without them to believe otherwise. </p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p><p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
