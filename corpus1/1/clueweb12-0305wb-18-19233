                      <p><b>The Small Business Equity Gap</b></p>
                      <p> Of the 500 fastest growing companies in the United States 
                        (the &#8220;Inc. 500&#8221;) in 2002 (measured by revenue 
                        growth over five years), 41 percent started business with 
                        $10,000 or less and 14 percent started with less than 
                        $1,000. In contrast, only 22 percent started with more 
                        than $100,000. Only 2 percent of the 2002 Inc. 500 list 
                        received seed capital from venture capitalists. </p>
                      <p> The formal venture capital industry, comprised of professionally 
                        managed venture capital funds, tends to reject small deals 
                        because they are simply not worth the costs associated 
                        with their assessment and monitoring. Furthermore, as 
                        the size of private venture capital funds has increased, 
                        the size of the average investment per round of financing 
                        and, perhaps more important, the size of the average first-round 
                        investment, has increased significantly. Table 1.1 shows 
                        the size of first-round financing by industry group and 
                        overall in the formal venture capital industry over the 
                        period 1980 to 2003. </p>
                      <p>While there has been some softening in recent years, 
                        the average first-round investment in the formal venture 
                        capital industry remains significant and has exacerbated 
                        the equity gap at the earliest stages of a business's 
                        development. As a consequence, government venture capital 
                        policy and programs often focus on angel financing generally 
                        as well as seed and start-up financing because early-stage 
                        financing has the potential to generate the greatest social 
                        returns through job creation and product innovation and 
                        because financing at these stages is not adequately addressed 
                        by the formal venture capital industry. </p>
                      <p> In formulating government incentives for angel financing, 
                        it is essential to appreciate that not all small and medium-sized 
                        businesses (SMEs) are the same and not all informal venture 
                        capital investors are the same. Government policy should 
                        target investment by the right angel investors in the 
                        right businesses. </p>
                      <p>Given the fact that the vast majority of love and angel 
                        capitalists are taxable individuals, it is only natural 
                        that both federal and state governments have focused on 
                        tax measures affecting individuals as a means of addressing 
                        the financing difficulties faced by SMEs. In fact, tax 
                        measures have tended to be the predominant means of government 
                        intervention (and expenditure) in the area of informal 
                        venture capital. Too often, however, these tax measures 
                        have been poorly targeted with respect to the businesses 
                        and/or the investors that benefit from the measures. </p>
                      <p>SMEs are often touted, particularly by their own lobby 
                        groups, as the key to economic growth. Statistics&#8212;for 
                        example, that SMEs account for over 99.7 percent of all 
                        employers, employ over half of all employees, are responsible 
                        for over half of research and development, and account 
                        for most of the job growth in the past few decades&#8212;are 
                        often bandied about, giving the impression that SMEs should 
                        be viewed as a homogenous group to be imbued with government 
                        support. However, the term, SME, includes a broad range 
                        of businesses. In the context of government policy targeting 
                        investment in SMEs, an important distinction must be drawn 
                        between small businesses that plan to grow rapidly and 
                        other small businesses that provide a livelihood to a 
                        relatively small and stable (in terms of number, though 
                        not in terms of employee longevity) group of people. </p>
                      <p>A rapid growth SME, as the name implies, is a business 
                        that intends to expand quickly (generally in order to 
                        capture a large market share by capitalizing on new technology) 
                        and requires significant capital to achieve its objectives. 
                        The vast majority of small businesses (over 90 percent), 
                        sometimes referred to as lifestyle businesses, are generally 
                        not businesses that venture capitalists consider for investment 
                        because there is little likelihood of growth and exiting 
                        the investment is significantly more difficult. </p>
                      <p>Moreover, from a government policy perspective, these 
                        lifestyle businesses are not job creators, but job churners 
                        and the jobs that they churn are not &#8220;good&#8221; 
                        jobs; generally, they are low-paying jobs with few benefits, 
                        little security, and few prospects for advancement. What 
                        create good jobs are not small businesses, per se, but 
                        small businesses that grow large. These rapid growth SMEs 
                        represent only four to eight percent of all small businesses, 
                        yet since 1979 they have accounted for 70 to 75 percent 
                        of net new jobs. Moreover, one-fifth of the rapid growth 
                        SMEs accounted for almost one-half of all jobs generated 
                        by autonomous new firms. </p>
                      <p>Government incentives for venture capital formation should 
                        target only rapid growth SMEs. </p>
                      <p>Just like the businesses in which they invest, business 
                        angels are not a homogeneous group. They range from the 
                        once in a lifetime investor helping out a family member 
                        or friend to the professional angel who is continually 
                        evaluating and monitoring investment opportunities. When 
                        developing government policy affecting investment in rapid 
                        growth businesses at their earliest stages of development, 
                        it is important to consider the factors that influence 
                        angel capital investment, particularly the factors that 
                        influence the decision to invest (and how much). Studies 
                        of angel investors tend to suggest that tax incentives 
                        will not make angel investors out of non-angels. At best, 
                        tax incentives may increase the amount of venture capital 
                        that existing angels are willing to invest (or reinvest). 
                        Accordingly, the incentives should target repeat investors. 
                      </p>
                      <p><b>Federal Tax Policy and Angels</b></p>
                      <p>Federal tax policy affecting angels has focused on four 
                        areas: the general capital gains tax rate; a preferential 
                        tax rate for gains realized on small business securities; 
                        a &#8220;rollover&#8221; or tax deferral when proceeds 
                        from the sale of small business securities are reinvested 
                        in other small business investments; and the preferential 
                        treatment of capital losses from small business securities. 
                      </p>
                      <p>Unfortunately, government policy in recent years has 
                        focused almost exclusively on a general capital gains 
                        tax preference. An abundance of economic literature has 
                        considered the impact of a general capital gains tax preference 
                        on risk-taking and the conclusions are, at best, mixed. 
                        At the very least, it is difficult to refute the argument 
                        that an across-the-board reduction of capital gains taxation 
                        is a very blunt instrument for encouraging investment 
                        in new technology firms. In fact, it can have the opposite 
                        effect. Given the relative difficulty of exiting venture 
                        capital investments, a general capital gains tax preference 
                        is more likely to increase investment in property for 
                        which there is a large secondary market, including publicly-traded 
                        securities and real estate. </p>
                      <p>Furthermore, a reduced capital gains tax rate applicable 
                        to all capital property undermines more appropriately 
                        targeted incentives. For example, when the long-term capital 
                        gains tax rate was reduced to 15 percent in 2003, the 
                        capital gains tax preference for qualified small business 
                        stock (QSBS) was essentially eliminated. In the absence 
                        of alternative minimum tax (AMT), the effective tax rate 
                        for QSBS gains is only one percent below the long-term 
                        capital gains tax rate; and if the gain is subject to 
                        AMT, the preference over long-term capital gains is only 
                        2/100ths of one percent. </p>
                      <p> The angel capital rollover is certainly a more targeted 
                        measure, although it too has its deficiencies. First, 
                        as in the case of the tax preference attached to QSBS, 
                        any reduction in the general capital gains tax preference 
                        undermines the more targeted preference. </p>
                      <p>Second, the angel capital rollover is limited to individual 
                        investors and is therefore of no benefit to corporate 
                        venture capital investors. While most angel investors 
                        are individuals, small businesses, particularly at the 
                        seed or start-up stage, often receive financing from key 
                        suppliers or customers. A rollover would provide a greater 
                        incentive to these corporate investors to reinvest proceeds 
                        from a successful small business investment in other small 
                        businesses because the gain would otherwise be subject 
                        to tax at the general corporate tax rate. </p>
                      <p>Third, the 60-day time period in which a replacement 
                        QSBS investment must be found is extremely short and may 
                        lead to rash investment decisions in order to secure the 
                        deferral. Canada, which recently introduced an angel capital 
                        rollover modeled on the US provision, gives individuals 
                        the remainder of the calendar year in which the disposition 
                        occurs plus a further 120 days to find a replacement investment. 
                        Given the difficulties in matching angel investors with 
                        potential investments, a more generous time period to 
                        find a replacement investment would be appropriate. </p>
                      <p> Not surprisingly, the first relief measure targeting 
                        angel capital investment was not the preferential treatment 
                        of capital gains from dispositions of small business stock. 
                        Rather, it was enhanced relief for capital losses from 
                        small business investments, which would otherwise be deductible 
                        only to the extent of realized capital gains. For angel 
                        capitalists, more relaxed loss limitation provisions are 
                        a more direct and effective way to increase venture capital 
                        investment than a capital gains tax preference, even a 
                        targeted tax preference such as the capital gains exemption 
                        for QSBS. As No?l Cunningham and Deborah Schenk note, 
                        a capital gains tax preference is &#8220;a very poor second-best 
                        solution&#8221; to full loss relief. Consider the following 
                        example. </p>
                      <p>An individual (Ms. X) has a choice of two investments: 
                        the first is a riskless investment with an annual rate 
                        of return of 10 percent. The second is a risky investment, 
                        in which there is a 40 percent chance that Ms. X's 
                        investment will triple in one year and a 60 percent chance 
                        that the investment will fail completely within one year. 
                        The expected rate of return on the second investment is 
                        therefore 20 percent. All individuals are risk-adverse 
                        to some extent and would therefore limit the amount invested 
                        in the second investment despite the fact that the expected 
                        return is double that of the riskless investment. Suppose 
                        that in the absence of tax, Ms. X is unwilling to invest 
                        more than $1,000 in the second investment (i.e., Ms. X 
                        will not risk losing more than $1,000). Suppose now that 
                        a 40 percent proportionate tax is introduced with full 
                        loss offset. This tax would reduce the after-tax rate 
                        of return on the first investment to 6 percent and on 
                        the second investment to 12 percent. Although the relative 
                        attractiveness of the two investments remains the same, 
                        Ms. X should be willing to invest more money in the second 
                        investment because the government has in effect assumed 
                        40 percent of the risk. On the other hand, if the utility 
                        of losses is restricted and Ms. X has no other capital 
                        investments, she would not invest in the second investment 
                        at all. </p>
                      <p>If losses remain restricted but a capital gains tax preference 
                        is introduced&#8212;for example, 50 percent of the gain 
                        is excluded from tax, as is the case with the QSBS exemption&#8212;the 
                        expected return on the second investment is 4 percent, 
                        still less than the after-tax return on the riskless investment. 
                        Since 1958, individual taxpayers have been entitled to 
                        deduct from all income a certain amount of capital losses 
                        from &#8220;section 1244 stock&#8221; (rather that restricting 
                        the deduction to capital gains). Since 1978, the amount 
                        of capital losses from section 1244 stock that can be 
                        offset against ordinary income has been $50,000 ($100,000 
                        for a married person filing a joint return) and the maximum 
                        amount of section 1244 stock that a small business corporation 
                        can issue has been $1,000,000. Neither limit has increased 
                        since 1978. </p>
                      <p> There are two major problems with the section 1244 stock 
                        provisions. The first is that the limits&#8212;both the 
                        limit affecting each investor's loss and the limit 
                        on section 1244 stock that each SME can issue&#8212;are 
                        too low, particularly given the increasing size of the 
                        equity gap that angel investors are supposed to fill. 
                      </p>
                      <p>The second problem is that the tax preference is poorly 
                        targeted, in that there are no restrictions on the types 
                        of small businesses for which relief is provided. Given 
                        the fact that the vast majority of small businesses and 
                        small business failures are lifestyle businesses, the 
                        vast majority of individuals benefiting from section 1244 
                        are not angel investors, but love capital investors in 
                        lifestyle business. The provision could be more appropriately 
                        targeted&#8212;for example, by excluding from the benefit 
                        a &#8220;black list&#8221; of businesses, similar to that 
                        applicable to the QSBS provisions. By better targeting 
                        the measure, the relief provided in individual cases could 
                        be increased, say to $200,000 ($400,000 for a married 
                        person filing a joint return), and the amount of section 
                        1244 stock that each corporation can issue could also 
                        be increased. </p>
                      <p><b>State Tax Policy and Angels</b></p>
                      <p>A number of states&#8212;for example, Indiana, Iowa, 
                        Maine, and Missouri&#8212;have introduced income tax credits 
                        for seed capital investment in small businesses. These 
                        tax credits act as a front-end incentive targeting primarily 
                        angel capitalists. By reducing the after-tax cost of the 
                        investment, the state government essentially assumes some 
                        of the risk of investment. In this respect, the tax credit 
                        acts in a manner similar to increased loss relief for 
                        venture capital investments. However, the tax credit is 
                        provided regardless of an investment's success whereas 
                        loss relief is available only if the investment fails. 
                      </p>
                      <p> While the state tax credit programs tend to target the 
                        right SMEs (generally through a &#8220;white list&#8221; 
                        of permitted investments), they do not necessarily target 
                        the right investors. Angel capitalists must rely on their 
                        own ability to choose and monitor appropriate investments 
                        because there is no professional intermediary that assists 
                        in these functions, in contrast with formal venture capital 
                        market intermediaries. An angel capital tax credit does 
                        not distinguish between sophisticated and unsophisticated 
                        angels. Securities legislation has acted as a safeguard 
                        in this respect to some extent; however, some jurisdictions 
                        have relaxed their securities regulations affecting private 
                        placements in order to promote small business investment 
                        to the point that this safety feature has been eliminated. 
                        Sophisticated angels provide more than capital to a fledgling 
                        business; their expertise may assist the business in developing 
                        its products and perhaps in accessing additional capital. 
                        Less sophisticated angels can act as impediments when 
                        additional capital is sought. </p>
                      <p>It is difficult for a tax credit program to target only 
                        those angel investors who will add value (other than capital) 
                        to the qualified business and it is perhaps inappropriate 
                        for governments to engage in such paternalistic behavior. 
                        Where, however, the government introduces a tax credit 
                        (or other tax or financial incentives) to induce investment 
                        in SMEs and at the same time provides little if any protection 
                        in the form of information disclosure requirements to 
                        investors in the securities legislation or the tax credit 
                        program, it opens up the potential for unscrupulous behavior 
                        that can undermine investor confidence. </p>
                      <p>Generally speaking, there are minimal requirements that 
                        a small business must meet before receiving government 
                        certification for the tax credit and unsophisticated angels 
                        may be inclined to view state certification of a small 
                        business as a &#8220;stamp of approval,&#8221; despite 
                        express statements by the government to the contrary. 
                        Unless the government is prepared to assume the role of 
                        financial intermediary and undertake a full evaluation 
                        of the small businesses applying for the tax credit in 
                        an attempt to select &#8220;winners&#8221;&#8212;a role 
                        for which the government is ill-equipped&#8212;government 
                        programs should target more seasoned angel capitalists 
                        or specialized investment vehicles, such as professionally 
                        managed small business investment funds, that can better 
                        evaluate potential investments and nurture the businesses 
                        in which they invest. The various state angel capital 
                        tax credit programs do none of these things. An angel 
                        capital tax credit combined with the recent tendency to 
                        relax securities regulation affecting private financings 
                        is, in may view, a recipe for disaster. Informal venture 
                        capital investment is better served by an expanded angel 
                        capital rollover and greater loss relief for appropriately-targeted 
                        small business investments. In my view, state government 
                        incentives for early-stage venture investing should focus 
                        on non-tax measures, such as developing angel capital 
                        networks or incubator programs, which more directly address 
                        the information asymmetries particularly prevalent at 
                        the earliest states of a business's development.</p>
