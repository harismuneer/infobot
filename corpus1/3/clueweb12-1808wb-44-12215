<UL><LI>This calculator assumes that all of your long-term capital gains and qualified dividends are taxed at either 0% or 15%.<LI>The tax is 0% for the portion of your gain that would have been taxed at 15% or lower tax if it were a short-term gain.<P>  <LI>The tax is 15% for any of your capital gain that would have been taxed at a rate higher than 15% if it were considered a short term gain.<P>

<DT><B>Recent tax legislation</B><DD>The "Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act" passed in 2003, and additional, related legislation in almost every year since, has included some significant, often temporary, and somewhat confusing changes.  This is in addition to the already complex tax code changes passed by Congress in 2000. Below is a summary of the changes that impact most taxpayers in 2008. <P>
<OL>
<LI><b>Child tax credit:</b> The child tax credit has been increased from $600 to $1,000 through 2010.  Starting in 2010, the tax credit returns to the level originally passed in the 2000 tax bill.  The credit is, however, still phased out for higher incomes.<P>
<LI><b>Marriage penalty relief:</b> The new law makes the standard deduction for married couples filing jointly and qualified widowers to be double that of single tax filers.  This puts the standard deduction for 2008 at $10,900. In addition to the increased standard deduction, the 15% tax bracket has been increased for married tax filers to further reduce the impact of the marriage penalty.  <P>

Taxpayers in the 10% or 15% bracket pay 0% percent in 2008. Taxpayers in tax brackets above 15%, pay a 15% rate of tax on dividends paid between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2008.<P>
