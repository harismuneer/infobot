A lot of people think of the United States of America as a Democracy, when
in fact we are a Republic. Or to be more accurate, we function as a democracy
in some matters and we function as a republic in others. The confusion is
understandable. Although our pledge of allegiance clearly says "to the Republic",
all we hear from our news sources is that we are a democracy. While some
matters really are decided by the popular vote, most of our laws are decided
by individuals we voted into office to represent us. There are pluses and
minus to each system. For the most part, I believe our country has a healthy
balance, with only a few exceptions every now and then (for example, so far
the Republican party has been able to keep the citizens of North Carolina
from voting on the lottery issue). But one thing that I for one would like
to see changed as soon as possible is the way we elect the President of the
United States. The system is out dated, no longer needed, and seems
anti-democratic when we have results similar to those in the 2000 presidential
election.
<P>
The president of the United States is chosen by the electoral college, not
directly by the citizens' vote. This system was established over 200 years
ago, in the year 1787, as compromise of a bitter dispute between the delegates
at the Constitutional Convention. Some wanted Congress or the state legislatures
to be the ones that selected the president, while others thought there should
be a popular vote. A body of electors chosen by each of the states, was created
as the compromise. Given the population, technology, and demographics at
the time, it probably made sense. Part of the reasoning was that it was hard
to govern beyond the "city limits". It would have been quite difficult to
have a popular vote when you have get votes from the most remote locations
of the young United States. There was also an elitist view, which I find
quite distasteful. In the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton basically
said it was too complicated a matter for the general mass to decide on. 
<P>
So over 200 years later, we still have the electoral college system of choosing
the president. There are 538 Electoral College voters, one per senator and
representative from each state. Washington D.C. has 3 votes. They all meet,
usually in their respective state capitols, and vote for a president and
vice president. Most states give the winner of that state's popular vote
all of their electoral votes. Only Nebraska and Maine have provisions for
splitting their electoral votes. Whoever gets 270 votes wins. Because of
this system, you can have a situation where the electoral winner is not the
popular vote winner. This is the main reason I think we should do away with
the system because when it happens, it is anything but democratic.
<P>
I propose we do away with the electoral college system in its entirely. Every
other election in our nation, from mayor to senator to governor, is based
on a popular vote from the democratic method. The person with the most votes
wins. What could be simpler, and more democratic? It's clear that the reasons
needed for the electoral college system in the past, just don't exist in
this day and time. We are an educated and informed general public. We have
instant communications from coast to coast, border to border. There is no
reason why we can't just let the popular vote determine who the president
is going to be.
<P>
Some people against the idea of doing away with the electoral system counter
that if we just went on the popular vote, the candidates would only campaign
in and represent the larger cities. Well that's what they're doing now, but
on a state level. How much campaigning do the candidates do in North Dakota?
Wyoming? Alaska? Delaware? Or any of the other states that have a low number
of electors? Absolutely none! Instead, you find them campaigning in California,
Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, and other states that have large numbers of
electors. Their main goal is to win 270 electoral votes, so they're campaigning
in the big states that matter. With a direct popular vote method, all those
votes from the "little" states go into the pot of making the decision. They
might still campaign in the states with the big cities, but that wouldn't
matter, because without the electoral system, they can't win the entire state.
You'd find them actually trying to represent the majority of Americans, which
is what they should have been doing in the first place. And for those that
can't stomach a complete democracy of majority rule, and popular vote for
the presidency, we could have a compromise of splitting the electoral votes
according to the popular vote of each state. The presidential candidate would
get the same percentage of the electoral vote, as they got with the popular
vote.
<P>
I think the time has come for a change. Before we have another fiasco like
the 2000 election, we need to address and fix the problem. It's a shame and
disgrace when the country that is the democratic leader of the world gets
a president that was the SECOND choice of the American voters! It's time
to put our money where our mouth is, and get rid of our antiquated and obsolete
electoral college. And to demonstrate my thinking &nbsp;might be in line
with the majority of Americans, a "quick vote" Internet survey on CNN.com
currently shows that 70% of those participating in the vote also think "it's
time for a change". &nbsp;28% thinks the current system works, but I can't
help but think some of those might be George Bush supporters fearful of the
same 2000 election results. 2% voted "don't know".
