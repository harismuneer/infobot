					NAF Misawa Family Member Recognized with Spouse of the 
					Year Award </span></b>
					<span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:#000033">
					<br>
					By Chief Mass Communication Specialist Daniel Sanford, 
					U.S. Naval Air Facility Misawa, Japan Public Affairs</span></p>
					<p class="NoSpacing">MISAWA, Japan (NNS) -- A 
					Misawa-based family member received the Association of 
					Naval Aviation's 2009 Dorothy Flatley Naval Spouse of 
					the Year Award during a ceremony aboard Naval Air 
					Facility (NAF) Misawa, Japan, Nov. 9.<br>
					<br>
					Shelle Napier, spouse of Naval Air Facility Misawa's 
					Command Master Chief Michael Napier, received the award 
					during a ceremony where she was cited for her 
					inspirational support of Navy families while her 
					husband served as Strike Fighter Squadron (VFA) 27's 
					command master chief.<br>
					<br>
					The Dorothy Flatley Award is given annually to one 
					spouse from Naval Air Forces Pacific and one spouse 
					from Naval Air Forces Atlantic. Napier was named 
					Pacific's winner due to her support of squadron 
					families in which she focused on building strong morale 
					among her fellow squadron personnel and their family 
					members, especially during deployments.<br>
					<br>
					She was recognized for bringing the COMPASS program 
					aboard NAF Atsugi. Sponsored by the Naval Service 
					Familyline in Washington D.C., COMPASS is a 
					spouse-to-spouse mentoring program that covers naval 
					history and traditions, benefits, finances, and 
					multiple-related topics of acute interest to Navy 
					families.<br>
					<br>
					Napier originally became involved with COMPASS while 
					stationed aboard Fleet Activities Yokosuka, Japan. <br>
					<br>
					&quot;COMPASS is such a worthwhile program for spouses and 
					family members,&quot; said Napier. &quot;It was definitely a 
					program that Atsugi needed for the spouses, and we 
					found early on the sharing of all the resources 
					available benefited the entire community.&quot; <br>
					<br>
					Beyond COMPASS, Napier also initiated several 
					innovative, family-oriented projects.<br>
					<br>
					She coordinated a summer pool party where children made 
					&quot;welcome home&quot; banners for their deployed parents. She 
					also constructed a squadron &quot;gratitude tree&quot; and 
					encouraged family members to participate by writing 
					brief messages on a leaf or sending a picture of their 
					family for decoration. <br>
					<br>
					&quot;The squadron was coming home a few days before 
					Thanksgiving, and we had gone the whole deployment 
					without any incidents,&quot; said Napier. &quot;I felt we should 
					focus on being grateful. Many families took part in 
					this; the tree ended up being about five-feet tall, and 
					was placed in a very prominent place at the squadron 
					hangar. <br>
					<br>
					Napier was also a huge component behind numerous 
					baked-good giveaways for single Sailors, potluck 
					dinners and fundraisers – all in support of VFA 27 
					families.<br>
					<br>
					&quot;Look, everything I did was part of a larger team 
					effort,&quot; said Napier. &quot;I grew up in a family where 
					service was just something we did; it's always been a 
					part of my life. As far as the award goes, I think I 
					was just lucky to be recognized, and for that I am 
					extremely humbled.&quot;<br>
					<br>
					Napier and her husband arrived in Misawa in June. She 
					said while she is still looking for her niche in 
					Misawa, she is already firmly involved aboard the 
					facility.<br>
					<br>
					&quot;I'm very busy volunteering at church, with the family 
					readiness group and substitute teaching,&quot; she said. <br>
					<br>
					Napier said she would also like to bring the COMPASS 
					program aboard NAF Misawa. She said regardless of the 
					capacity, she is committed to helping others, no matter 
					where she may reside.<br>
					<br>
					&quot;Helping others just has a ripple effect,&quot; Napier said. 
					&quot;When it comes down to it, if you have an unhappy 
					spouse you have an unhappy family, and it then leads to 
					good Sailors leaving the Navy. If we can help a spouse 
					be more knowledgeable and involved with Navy life, as 
					well as their respective commands, everyone benefits 
					from it, especially the Navy.&quot;</p>

					will replace steam catapults on future aircraft 
					carriers.<br>
					<br>
					“This is a tremendous achievement not just for the ALRE 
					team, but for the entire Navy,” said Capt. James 
					Donnelly, ALRE program manager. “Saturday’s EMALS 
					launch demonstrates an evolution in carrier flight deck 
					operations using advanced computer control, system 
					monitoring and automation for tomorrow’s carrier air 
					wings.” <br>
					<br>
					EMALS is a complete carrier-based launch system 
					designed for Gerald R. Ford (CVN 78) and future 
					Ford-class carriers. <br>
					<br>
					“I thought the launch went great,” said Lt. Daniel 
					Radocaj, the test pilot from Air Test and Evaluation 
					Squadron 23 (VX-23) who made the first EMALS manned 
					launch. “I got excited once I was on the catapult but I 
					went through the same procedures as on a steam 
					catapult. The catapult stroke felt similar to a steam 
					catapult and EMALS met all of the expectations I had.”
					<br>
					<br>
					The current aircraft launch system for Navy aircraft 
					carriers is the steam catapult. Newer, heavier and 
					faster aircraft will result in launch energy 
					requirements approaching the limits of the steam 
					catapult system.<br>
					<br>
					The mission and function of EMALS remain the same as 
					the steam catapult; however, EMALS employs entirely 
					different technologies. EMALS will deliver the 
					necessary higher launch energy capacity as well as 
					substantial improvements in system weight, maintenance, 
					increased efficiency, and more accurate end-speed 
					control. <br>
					<br>
					“I felt honored to be chosen as the Shooter to help 
					launch the first live aircraft tested on the new EMALS 
					track at Lakehurst,” said Chief Petty Officer Brandon 
					Barr, Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division Test 
					Department, Lakehurst. “It was very exciting to 
					knowingly be a part of naval aviation history. Petty 
					Officers 1st Class Hunsaker and Robinson, Petty 
					Officers 2nd Class Williams, Wong, and Simmons, were 
					the sailors on my team who worked together to help make 
					this test a success. We all look forward to seeing this 
					cutting edge technology deployed on the Gerald R. 
					Ford.&quot;<br>
					<br>
					“I’m excited about the improvement EMALS will bring to 
					the fleet from a capability and reliability 
					perspective,” said Cmdr. Russ McCormack, ALRE, PMA-251, 
					deputy program manager for future systems. “EMALS was 
					designed for just that purpose, and the team is 
					delivering that requirement.”<br>
					<br>
					The system’s technology allows for a smooth 
					acceleration at both high and low speeds, increasing 
					the carrier’s ability to launch aircraft in support of 
					the warfighter. <br>
					<br>
					The system will provide the capability for launching 
					all current and future carrier air wing platforms – 
					lightweight unmanned to heavy strike fighters. <br>
					<br>
					Engineers will continue system functional demonstration 
					testing at NAVAIR Lakehurst. The team will expand 
					aircraft launches with the addition of T-45 and C-2 
					aircraft next year. </p>

					<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you all 
					know, this year we celebrate the first centennial of 
					Naval Aviation, the rich Coast Guard Aviation heritage 
					that it spawned, and the legacy of Coast Guard Aviators 
					that have gone before us - some of whom have gone but 
					never returned.&nbsp; Coast Guard Aviation is more robust 
					and more relevant today than ever before in our 
					nation's history. Taking the time to reflect upon and 
					celebrate the history and legacy of what Coast Guard 
					Aviation has accomplished and what the CG Aviators of 
					today still do for our country seems only fitting.</p>
					<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we close the 
					chapter on the first century of Naval Aviation and open 
					the next chapter, Coast Guard Aviation needs an annual 
					event, one worthy of providing a means to celebrate its 
					rich heritage.&nbsp; Additionally, this annual event could 
					serve as a more formal &quot;hail and farewell&quot; to welcome 
					newly assigned or retired CG Aviators and their spouses 
					to the Capital Region and to bid a fond farewell to 
					those departing the Capital area to future assignments.</p>
					<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The First 
					Annual Coast Guard Aviation Air Ball is scheduled for 
					Saturday evening, May 7th.&nbsp; This Flight Suit Formal 
					will be held at one of the DC area's many hotel 
					ballrooms or military officer's club.&nbsp; Cost is 
					anticipated to be approximately $50 per person.&nbsp; All CG 
					Aviators and their spouses/guests will be invited.</p>
					<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assuming we 
					have enough interest more details and official 
					invitations will follow.&nbsp; Please use the voting buttons

					(KAKE ABC WICHITA) ... </span>
					<span style="font-size:
12.0pt;font-style:normal">Chris Frank</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">It's going to be anchors away for 
					the C-40A as Boeing Wichita delivers the modified 737 
					to the United States Navy.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">The C-40A has been modified for 
					the U.S. Navy and is equipped with a main-deck cargo 
					door and can be configured for troop transport, cargo 
					transport or both. With a state-of-the-art flight deck; 
					21st century avionics; and quiet, clean, fuel-efficient 
					engines, the C-40A increases the Navy's capability for 
					rapid response to the fleet worldwide.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;The C-40A plays an important role 
					in the Navy Unique Fleet Essential Airlift (NUFEA) 
					fleet,&quot; said Vice Adm. Dirk Debbink, Chief of Navy 
					Reserve. &quot;These fuel-efficient, extremely flexible 
					logistics-support aircraft are an integral part of 
					every maritime mission, from humanitarian assistance to 
					power projection. The bottom line is the ability of the 
					C-40A to provide our nation important, Navy-unique 
					airlift capability at a lower cost. We welcome this new 
					aircraft into the fleet!&quot;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">A lot of Wichitans have a hand in 
					building the plane. The work on the plane starts at 
					Spirit Aerosystems where the entire fuselage is built. 
					The fuselage is then shipped to Renton, Washington for 
					final assembly, then flown back to Wichita for the 
					modification work that is a specialty of Boeing 
					Wichita.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;The C-40A plays an important role

					<p class="MsoNormal">The Navy C-40As, which replace the 
					service's fleet of C-9s, are based at the Naval Air 
					Station (NAS) Joint Reserve Base (JRB) in Forth Worth, 
					Texas, at NAS Jacksonville, Fla., and at NAS North 
					Island in San Diego, Calif. The new aircraft will be 
					immediately stationed at NAS JRB Fort Worth, where 
					crews will provide transition training for crews at NAS 
					Oceana, Va., a new C-40A location scheduled to open 
					next year.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">This is the 10th C-40 delivered to 
					the Navy since 2001, but the first since 2006. Boeing 
					brass say celebrating a delivery like this is 
					particularly satisfying because of the current economic 
					challenges.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Things are tough. So to be able 
					to celebrate and have a satisfied customer that's 
					actually coming back for more, as you heard the admiral 
					say,&quot; Wade added. &quot;We have another plane here that 
					we're modifying today and one more coming so we are 
					excited.&quot;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Boeing is on contract to deliver 
					two additional C-40As; one 737 is currently being 
					modified at the Wichita facility, while the other is on 
					the Boeing Commercial Airplanes production line in 
					Renton, Wash.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;We're looking forward to 
					continuing to enhance the Navy's fleet of C-40As with 
					as many aircraft as are required to support this 
					mission,&quot; said Wade. &quot;The C-40A is a proven workhorse, 
					whether it is delivering humanitarian aid to the scenes 
					of natural disasters or military equipment to ships and 
					troops on the ground.&quot;</p>

					<p class="MsoNormal"><i>(NEWCASTLE NORTHERN ECHO (UK) 
					22 NOV 10)</i></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">(This is a tad dated – BUT still 
					newsworthy – Dutch)</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">A quarter of a century ago, HMS 
					Ark Royal slipped majestically into the waters off the 
					North-East. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">Now she 
					is preparing to weigh anchor for the final time after 
					the Government announced her decommissioning. Dani Webb 
					joined the crew on her farewell tour to find out about 
					life onboard. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">Cutting 
					proudly through the waves of the North Sea, HMS Ark 
					Royal could be in the midst of any of its many voyages 
					from the past 25 years. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">But as 
					four Harrier fixedwing aircraft break through the dark 
					clouds to make their final landing onboard a British 
					warship, it is clear this is no ordinary trip. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">
					Lieutenant Chris Roy may be making his 50th landing on 
					the deck of the carrier, built by Swan Hunter, in 
					Wallsend, North Tyneside, but impressive as it is, it 
					is not that which catches the eye – rather the red “For 
					sale” sign he has put up in his cockpit. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">It 
					brings a smile to those watching from the flight deck, 
					but behind it there is a more serious message. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">The 
					Government sent shockwaves through the 650- strong crew 
					when it announced last month that, as part of millions 
					of pounds-worth of defence cuts, the end was nigh for 
					the vessel known as the Mighty Ark. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">For the 
					Harrier jet pilots, it could mean the end of their 
					jobs, as their role will no longer be required. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">“In the 
					Royal Navy, when the chips are down we have to do 
					something to keep us smiling,” </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">says Lt 
					Roy. “That’s what I was doing because it is a sad day.
					</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">“We just 
					don’t know what the future holds, but hopefully we will 
					find something. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">“It 
					wasn’t the best landings any of us have ever done, but 
					I really enjoyed it. It is the last of them and now we 
					have to look forward.” </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">Many of 
					the flagship carrier’s crew have already received 
					assurances about their futures in the Royal Navy, but 
					it is not their jobs, rather the end of the 
					relationship with Ark Royal that brings a tear to the 
					eye. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">Everyone 
					from Captain Jerry Kyd through to the administration 
					staff and the chefs are feeling the pain of losing an 
					illustrious name that has been in service for more than 
					500 years. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">
					Executive Officer Rob Bellfield, second in command to 
					the captain, says: “The decision had a huge impact on 
					everyone, but we are delighted to have been given this 
					chance to show her off one last time. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">“We are 
					a fully functioning warship and, if we were called away 
					now, everyone would be ready.” </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">
					Experiencing all 22,000 tonnes of Ark Royal from the 
					inside is a real eye-opener. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">The 
					steel corridors are lined with miles of exposed piping, 
					water-tight doors are in place every few metres and 
					steep metal ladders separate the many floors. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">In some 
					areas, up to 21 sailors can share a cramped dormitory 
					made up of threehigh bunk beds and during rough seas a 
					“seatbelt” is provided to stop you falling out. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">Those 
					who work onboard do not hanker for luxuries – they are 
					here to carry out a very important job. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">HMS Ark 
					Royal may be on her farewell voyage, but watching the 
					crew going about their roles with meticulous precision, 
					you would never think it. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">Whether 
					they have been onboard for a few weeks or many years, 
					they know what they have to do. No one is winding down 
					or even thinking about life after the Mighty Ark until 
					that last switch is pushed and the landing ladder drawn 
					up. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">They may 
					have removed most of the ammunition at its last port of 
					call – Glenmallan, near Glasgow – but the crew could 
					still step into action if the call ever came. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">Nothing 
					stops them from doing their job. Not the rough seas we 
					encounter as we sail around the top of Scotland or, on 
					a lesser scale, the bouts of inevitable sea sickness.
					</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">“If 
					there is an incident, you just have to get on with it,”
					</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">says 
					20-year-old steward Daniel Phillips, from North 
					Shields, in North Tyneside. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">As we’re 
					given a guided tour of the ship “flood, flood, flood” 
					booms out of the tannoys. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">There’s 
					no panic, just half-adozen engineers rushing by en 
					route to solving the problem while everyone else 
					carries on as if nothing is happening. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">As she 
					sailed smoothly back to Northumbria Quay on Friday, the 
					realisation among the crew that the end was near began 
					to hit home. Their jobs will continue after HMS Ark 
					Royal has been decommissioned, but each one of them 
					hopes her name, at least, will return to the high seas 
					one day. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-indent:.25in">As 
					Executive Officer Bellfield says: “She will bow out 
					with dignity, but it is a great name and hopefully 
					we’ll see it used again in the future.” </p>

					<p class="MsoNormal">Whidbey Island Naval Air Station 
					Patrol Squadron (VP) 46 “Grey Knights” is coming home 
					from a six-month deployment.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">The first 87 Grey Knights arrived 
					by airlift on Monday, Nov. 29. The remainder of the 
					squadron will bring their stable of P-3C Orion aircraft 
					back to NAS Whidbey Island over the next two weeks.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">During the squadron’s deployment, 
					VP-46 supported various missions across three different 
					theaters of operation. In Iraq, they flew intelligence, 
					surveillance and reconnaissance over-watch missions, 
					supporting ground commanders as they safely withdrew 
					from Iraq, representing the departure of the last major 
					U.S. ground combat troops in Iraq.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Crews supported 6th Fleet, flying 
					missions with Combined Task Force 151’s counter-piracy 
					campaign. The Grey Knights also provided anti-submarine 
					warfare support for 7th Fleet. Even with a rigorous 
					flight schedule, VP-46 participated in numerous joint 
					exercises with British, Kuwaiti, Pakistani, Thai and 
					South Korean forces.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Throughout the deployment, the 
					Grey Knights continued their tradition of safe, 
					effective and efficient mission execution and furthered 
					the command’s safety record with over 46 years and 
					312,000 mishap-free flight hours – a Pacific Fleet 
					record.</p>

					<span style="font-style:normal">Lt. j.g. Brett Ballard, 
					HS-11 Public Affairs</span></p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;It's always a great feeling to be 
					back on the flight deck of the legendary ‘Big E,'&quot; said 
					HS-11 Commanding Officer Cmdr. Max Clark.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Next to the USS Constitution, USS 
					Enterprise is the Navy's oldest commissioned warship - 
					yet you wouldn't know it when you look at her.&quot;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">After its recent two-year stay in 
					the Northrop Grumman Shipyard in Newport News, Va., the 
					aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CVN 65) will serve as 
					the flagship for Commander, Carrier Strike Group Twelve 
					(CCSG-12) as the carrier prepares for its 21st 
					deployment.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;As of Thanksgiving, our squadron 
					finished with the heavy portions of our workup as part 
					of CSG-12. The composite training unit exercise (COMPTUEX) 
					Oct. 4 - 26 was the last major dragon that we had to 
					tame as part of Carrier Air Wing One (CVW-1) embarked 
					on the Enterprise. As part of COMPTUEX, the 
					Dragonslayers executed two live-fire Hellfire missile 
					shots&quot; said Clark.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;HS-11 was evaluated highly in 
					every mission area of COMPTUEX,&quot; said Executive Officer 
					Cmdr. Tony Moreno. &quot;After we complete the joint task 
					force exercise (JTFEX) in early January, the Enterprise 
					strike group will be certified for deployment. </p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;During the training, our 
					operators worked to achieve a more robust and 
					integrated anti-submarine mission between Enterprise 
					and other aviation assets.&quot;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Moreno noted that since the 
					disestablishment of the S-3 Viking squadrons, HS-11 has 
					pushed the integration of its anti-submarine mission 
					with land-based P-3C Orions and the HSL (SH-60B) 
					detachments embarked with the strike group's destroyers 
					and cruisers.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">After COMTUEX, HS-11 sent a 
					four-helicopter detachment to Atlantic Undersea Test 
					Evaluation Center (AUTEC) located on Andros Island, 
					Bahamas.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Pilots, aircrew and maintainers 
					participated in three days of intensive anti-submarine 
					warfare training where they worked with other aviation 
					and surface assets to locate and track submarines.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">While at AUTEC, the Dragon-slayers 
					also trained for Helicopter Visit Board Search and 
					Seizure (HVBSS).</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Clark added, &quot;We are about to 
					embark on JTFEX on board Enterprise for our final 
					pre-deployment exercise. After JTFEX, we will return 
					home for our holiday leave period before deploying with 
					CVW-1 in mid-January.&quot;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">When asked to name a 2010 mission 
					that stood out for him, Moreno said, &quot;Our people 
					received the Humanitarian Service Medal for their 
					contribution to Operation Unified Response in Haiti. We 
					fielded one of the first earthquake-response calls 
					early on Jan. 12 - and by that evening we had four 
					helicopters on board the aircraft carrier USS Carl 
					Vinson (CVN 70), which spent 10 weeks operating near 
					Port-au-Prince. Our maintainers and operators are top 
					notch, as evidenced by their accident-free 
					mobilization.&quot;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">AFCM(AW/SW) Rodney Feliciano 
					agreed, &quot;I talk to these guys all the time at our 
					morning and evening maintenance meetings and let them 
					know how important their job is to the fleet. They are 
					doing real good because it takes a lot of work to 
					maintain these Seahawks. The SH-60F first joined the 
					fleet back in 1988, so there's a lot of stuff that just 
					wears out. Our guys put in the extra time necessary to 
					keep them mission-ready and flying safely.&quot;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">The HS-11 Dragonslayers deploy 
					with SH-60F and HH-60H Seahawk helicopters that, in 
					addition to anti-submarine warfare, perform search and 
					rescue, drug interdiction, anti-ship warfare, cargo 
					lift and special operations missions.</p>

					<p><b><i><span style="color:#943634">Agence France-Presse</span></i><span style="color:#943634">
					</span></b>ABOARD USS ABRAHAM LINCOLN (AFP) -- Defence 
					Secretary Robert Gates on Monday told the crew of a US 
					aircraft carrier that the ship's warplanes were dealing 
					&quot;lethal blows&quot; to insurgents in Afghanistan.</p>
					<p>&quot;When your aircraft come screaming, our troops hear 
					the sound of relief and the enemy knows what's coming 
					next,&quot; Gates told hundreds of sailors in a vast hangar 
					on the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Arabian Sea.</p>
					<p>&quot;You are delivering lethal blows to them and 
					protecting the lives of our men and women on the 
					battlefield,&quot; he said, standing near parked F/A-18 
					fighter jets.</p>
					<p>Amid a surge of US reinforcements, American 
					commanders have stepped up the use of air strikes to 
					try to turn the tide in the nine-year-old war.</p>
					<p>In his first visit as secretary to a deployed 
					aircraft carrier, Gates acknowledged the bombing raids 
					carried the risk of civilian deaths, but said US forces 
					were taking extensive precautions.</p>
					<p>&quot;Recognizing the complexities of this battle 
					environment, you have been extraordinarily conscious 
					about the need to avoid civilian casualties,&quot; Gates 
					said.</p>
					<p>Afghan President Hamid Karzai has often expressed 
					anger over air strikes that have claimed civilian 
					lives, but US and NATO officials say Taliban insurgents 
					have caused a much higher number of civilian deaths, 
					through bombing attacks or by using civilians as cover.</p>
					<p>The Nimitz-class USS Abraham Lincoln, with a crew of 
					about 5,000, supports US-led troops in Afghanistan with 
					its fleet of F/A-18 Hornets as well as EA-6B Prowlers 
					and E-2C Hawkeyes.</p>
					<p>Pilots on the ship fly a total of about 27 sorties a 
					day to Afghanistan, hundreds of kilometres (miles) from 
					the carrier in the Arabian Sea, requiring mid-air 
					refueling on both legs of the mission, Rear Admiral 
					Mark Guadagnini told reporters.</p>
					<p>Asked if tensions over Iran's nuclear programme had 
					prompted his tour of the carrier, Gates said the visit 
					had been in the works for some time.</p>
					<p>&quot;I'm sure someone will try to make it into one but 
					it's not (a signal),&quot; Gates said.</p>
					<p>With public attention focused on roughly 150,000 
					coalition troops on the ground in Afghanistan, Gates 
					wanted to pay tribute to the &quot;largely unseen and 
					unheralded&quot; role played by naval ships and aircraft in 
					the war effort, his press secretary Geoff Morrell said.

					<p class="NoSpacing"><br>
					From USS Nimitz (CVN 68) Public Affairs</p>
					<p class="NoSpacing">BREMERTON, Wash. (NNS) -- USS 
					Nimitz (CVN 68) and 2,800 Sailors arrived at Naval Base 
					Kitsap in Bremerton, Wash., Dec. 9 after completing a 
					four-day transit from San Diego.<br>
					<br>
					Nimitz is in Bremerton to conduct a year-long 
					dry-docked maintenance period at the Puget Sound Naval 
					Shipyard (PSNS) and Intermediate Maintenance Facility 
					where the ship will receive major upgrades to its 
					combat, self defense, navigation and potable water 
					systems and numerous other components.<br>
					<br>
					The Navy also announced Dec. 9 that Nimitz will be 
					homeported at Naval Station Everett, Wash., upon 
					completion of the ship's maintenance period at 
					Bremerton. Nimitz is expected to complete the 
					maintenance period in December 2011.<br>
					<br>
					&quot;Great job to everyone for making this all happen,&quot; 
					said Capt. Paul O. Monger, Nimitz's commanding officer. 
					&quot;Maintenance of the ship, moving families and other 
					factors went into the decision.&quot;<br>
					<br>
					The general reaction of Sailors was mixed. Sailors were 
					relieved to hear the decision was made but some were 
					hoping to return to San Diego after the ship's dry-dock 
					period. Others, however, were excited about the ship 
					being homeported in Everett.<br>
					<br>
					&quot;I'm excited to finally know,&quot; said Aviation 
					Ordnanceman Airman Melody Rogers. &quot;We've been up in the 
					air wondering where we were going to go after 
					Bremerton. I'm just happy I'll be closer to home.&quot;<br>
					<br>
					Prior to pulling into port, Kitsap county officials, 
					Bremerton city officials and the mayors of both 
					Bremerton and Port Orchard, Wash., flew aboard to 
					welcome the ship and crew to the Kitsap area.<br>
					<br>
					&quot;It is exciting to see the dedication of the men and 
					women who defend us every day,&quot; said Lary Coppola, the 
					Port Orchard mayor.<br>
					<br>
					Hundreds of family members, friends and shipmates 
					welcomed Nimitz at the pier in Bremerton as the ship 
					arrived.<br>
					<br>
					&quot;I'm happy to see my husband again, and I'm excited to 
					be here in Washington. It's a beautiful area,&quot; said 
					Jessica Rubio, the wife of a Nimitz Sailor.<br>
					<br>
					For the Nimitz' crew, the next week will be busy as the 
					crew moves from the ship into their new homes in the 
					Kitsap area and into barracks rooms at Naval Base 
					Kitsap in Bremerton.<br>
					<br>
					&quot;I'm excited to be in the barracks,&quot; said Culinary 
					Specialist Seaman Brandy McHayle. &quot;It's going to be 
					more comfortable than living on the ship, and it's 
					better to be sleeping in a bed than a rack.&quot;<br>
					<br>
					Additionally, the ship will be offloading nearly 400 
					privately-owned vehicles that were onloaded in San 
					Diego as part of an opportune lift program to help 
					Sailors and families move their vehicles from 
					California to Washington.<br>
					<br>
					While in dry-dock, the Navy expects to accomplish 
					approximately 450,000 man days of work during the 
					docking-planned incremental availability. Much of the 
					work will be conducted by government workers at PSNS, 
					but a substantial amount, around 72,000 man days, is 
					expected to be accomplished in the private sector, with 
					a significant effort being accomplished by the Nimitz 
					crew.</p>

					Coming In 2016</p>
					<p class="story-byline">(SAN DIEGO UNION-TRIBUNE) ...
					<span style="font-style:normal">Jeanette Steele </span>
					</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">The Navy aircraft carrier Nimitz 
					will not return to San Diego, instead staying in 
					Washington state after an overhaul, but another carrier 
					will call San Diego its home port in 2016.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Secretary of the Navy Ray Mabus 
					said national defense strategy and $100 million in cost 
					savings are behind the decision to permanently move the 
					Nimitz.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">The savings come from the lower 
					cost of living in Everett, Wash., and reduced moving 
					expenses by keeping the flattop in the Puget Sound 
					region after its maintenance period.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Many factors were considered 
					here, including the quality of life for our sailors and 
					their families, and the considerable cost savings to 
					the American taxpayers,&quot; Mabus said in a statement from 
					the Navy. &quot;Maintaining a carrier in Everett will ensure 
					long-term strategic dispersal and operational readiness 
					of our fleet which is critical to our national 
					security.&quot;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Rep. Susan Davis, D-San Diego, 
					said she's been told by the Navy that there's an 
					expectation of a new carrier in San Diego by 2016. She 
					wouldn't reveal the incoming ship's name.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Given the importance of the 
					Pacific region to the prosperity and safety of the 
					United States, I believe San Diego remains the most 
					important strategic location for the United States Navy 
					and will continue to advocate for a robust naval 
					presence in San Diego and Coronado,&quot; she said, in a 
					written statement.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;After discussing this issue with 
					the chief of naval operations, I am confident that the 
					Navy fully understands the importance of San Diego. In 
					fact, San Diego is in place for a third carrier in 
					2016.&quot;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">If that happens, Davis added, the 
					city's time without three carriers on its skyline is 
					&quot;really just a long sabbatical.&quot;</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">A Defense Department official 
					confirmed a third carrier for San Diego in 2016, saying 
					that North Island Naval Air Station remains a capable 
					home port for up to three flattops. &quot;And, over the long 
					term, that is the plan,&quot; the official said, who added 
					that the ship hasn't yet been named.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Alpine, said 
					he is disappointed by the Nimitz move and wants more 
					information from the Navy.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">&quot;Relocating the Nimitz appears to 
					be a decision based more on strategic planning than 
					regional politics. Regardless of the Navy’s reasoning, 
					I want to know more about how the Navy arrived at this 
					decision and why it believes moving the Nimitz out of 
					San Diego – where certain infrastructure and training 
					facilities already exist – is in our national 
					interest,&quot; Hunter said, in a statement from his office.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">The Nimitz, with its 2,800 
					sailors, left San Diego Bay on Monday for a year-long 
					maintenance period in the Navy's Bremerton, Wash., 
					yard.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">Now it will stay in the Puget 
					Sound region, moving over to Naval Station Everett., 
					and the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln will head into 
					a Virginia shipyard for a major overhaul.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">For the present time, that leaves 
					the Navy with two of its 11 flattops in San Diego and 
					two in Washington state.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">The Carl Vinson and the Ronald 
					Reagan will remain stationed at North Island's piers 
					for the foreseeable future.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">It’s a major economic hit for San 
					Diego, as a carrier brings with it $203 million yearly 
					in sailor salaries, plus $4 million in annual utility 
					spending. On top of that, Navy families pour cash into 
					the region’s restaurants and shopping malls.</p>
					<p class="MsoNormal">The Navy estimated that the 
					carrier Carl Vinson brought $417 million in annual 
					economic impact when it arrived in San Diego in April.</p>

					<h3><a name="Aviation_Milestones_for_2011">Aviation Milestones for 2011</a></h3>
					<p class="MsoPlainText">From CHINFO = Key advancements 
					coming for Naval Aviation in 2011:</p>
					<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F-35 Lightning II. 
					The F-35B Marine Corps variant will continue flight 
					test envelope expansion, including 
					short-takeoff-and-vertical landing testing, aboard an 
					amphibious ship. The carrier variant, the F-35C, will 
					continue flight test envelope expansion, including 
					catapult and jet-blast deflector testing, at Naval Air 
					Station Lakehurst, N.J.</p>
					<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fire Scout. The 
					unmanned MQ-8B helicopter has two deployments scheduled 
					for 2011. The system will support intelligence, 
					surveillance and reconnaissance missions aboard the 
					frigate Halyburton in the Mediterranean Sea and Horn of 
					Africa, and ground-based operations in U.S. Central 
					Command.</p>
					<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; X-47B unmanned 
					strike aircraft. This carrier-based UAV will continue 
					flight tests at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.</p>
					<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cargo UAS. The Navy 
					intends to field the cargo unmanned aerial system this 
					fall for a six-month deployment, then choose one of two 
					contractors' designs for production.</p>
					<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P-8A Poseidon. The 
					P-8A will continue integrated testing at Naval Air 
					Station Patuxent River, Md., and is on track for fleet 
					introduction in 2013.</p>
					<p class="MsoPlainText">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EMALS. The 
					Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System planned for 
					Gerald R. Ford-class carriers just launched an F/A-18E 
					Super Hornet and will expand its test envelope by 
					launching T-45 and C-2 aircraft at the Lakehurst test 
					site in 2011.</p>
