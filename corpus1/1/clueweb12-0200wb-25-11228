                              <p class="style46">7.5 million children, adults, teachers joined politicians in over  100 countries to learn about the importance of everyone having the chance for a  quality education </p>
                              <p class="style5">More than 7.5 million children, adults, teachers and campaigners took  part in the Global Campaign for Education&rsquo;s &ldquo;World&rsquo;s Biggest Lesson&rdquo;. The world  record for the largest simultaneous lesson in history has been broken already &ndash;  and the numbers are still coming in.&nbsp; The  World&rsquo;s Biggest Lesson focused on providing a quality basic education to  everyone especially the 72 million children and 774 million adults who are  currently missing out.&nbsp; All over the  world Politicians and Ministers went back to school, were taught the lesson by  children before being asked what they planned to do to make sure everyone gets  a quality education.</p>
                              <p class="style5">The Global Campaign for Education is still collecting verification forms  from around the world, but an early count shows that the World Record has been  broken. The total attempting the record is at least seven and a half million  people.&nbsp; The country with the highest  recorded count is Bangladesh,  with 2.5 million people taking part in over 25,000 different locations across  the country.&nbsp; Millions also took part in  lesson in Vietnam and in an  impressive campaigning effort a million took part in the lesson in the Palestinian Territories.&nbsp; </p>

                                <p class="style5">23 April 2008, New Delhi: Hundreds of former child  laborers and school children participated in the world's biggest lesson  on education. Children themselves imparted a lesson to the noted  Bollywood personalities Actress Mahima Chaudhry, Producer Tanuja  Chandra, Jasbeer Jassi, the singer and Amit Shyal; Members of  Parliament and social activists here today at the FICCI auditorium as  part of the Global Action Week led by the President of Global Campaign  for Education a worldwide movement demanding universal basic full time  quality education for all. The Action Week in India is being jointly  organised by National Coalition for Education (NCE), Bachpan Bachao  Andolan (BBA), Global March Against Child Labor (GMACL), CARE, OXFAM,  World Vision and Save the Children Fund.<br>
                                <br>
                                Children led a slate pencil march to the Parliament carrying empty  slates in their tiny hands questioning the law makers and the  government as to why more than 1/3 rd of India 's population was  illiterate. At least 60-70 million children are still out of school.  The child laborers constitute the largest group of children excluded  from education in the country. The children demanded that right to  education must be immediately enacted to ensure slates, pencils and  books in the hands of children instead of work tools.<br>
                                <br>
&ldquo;India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Yet, it  accounts for 34% of world's illiterate population. Right to Education  has been enshrined since 2001 but it is neither supported by any law  nor is it substantiated with adequate budget. Though India does well in  school enrollment rate with primary school enrollment of 82%, the  drop-out rate is also very high at 39.8%. Quality of education is low.  School fee is still charged in many states. A lot of money is also  spent in the non-tuition fee like uniform, syllabus, books, building  cost etc.&rdquo; alleged the protestors. <br>
                                <br>
                                President of Global Campaign for Education (GCE), Kailash Satyarthi  said-&ldquo;Today at least 6 million children across 110 countries are going  to set a world record of the world's largest lesson on any issue in the  history. This would definitely be added to the Guinness Book of World  Records under the slogan &ndash; Quality education to end exclusion.&rdquo;<br>
                                <br>
                                Children from BBA and its partners, Amarlal and Sonia, imparted the  world's biggest lesson to the other children and the celebrities at the  FICCI Auditorium. The children also enacted a play- &ldquo;ladki padhke kya  karegi?&rdquo; (Why should a girl be educated?&rdquo;), depicting the need for  girls' education.</p>
                              <p class="style5">Bollywood  star Mahima Chaudhry said- &ldquo;I think nobody should ignore the voice of  these children. If their voice goes unheard, I am willing to be their  voice. Education should be not just a fundamental right but should be  made into a law.&rdquo;</p>
                              <p class="style5">The children  sang along with Jassi to his popular tunes. Notel film Producer Tanuja  Chandra said &ldquo;Education is our right that can possibly ease problems  especially in India . Children are the most precious gifts and their  education should be country's obsession.&rdquo;<br>
                                <br>
                                R.C. Dabas of the AIPTF said &ndash; Teacher's unions play an important role  in education for all. Our main focus has always been quality education  and we will make concerted efforts to ensure this to all children so  that all children can earn an education that equips them to get proper  employment. &rdquo;The Indian chapter of GCE, National Coalition for  Education (NCE) is a conglomeration of Parliamentary Forum on  education, Bachpan Bachao Andolan (BBA), All India Primary Teachers  Federation (AIPTF) and All India Federation of Teacher's Organisations  (AIFTO) Deepalya.</p>

                              <p class="style5">Shakira the popular singer now in the new avatar of Honorary Chair of the Global Campaign for Education was in the Capitol Hill with Congresswoman Nita Lowey (D-NY) asking the US lawmakers to enhance the flow of predictable aid towards the Education for All by 2015. Shakira said that I am speaking from experience of my native country Colombia where children have to work and beg for getting food.</p>
                              <p class="style5">She said that no child would ever want to work if they have the opportunity to attend full time school. For the children from the poor families the only incentive to attend full time schools is to be provided with meals in the school. She gave the personal example of the five schools she is running through her Bare Foot Foundation which is providing 5000 children in native Colombia with food and not a single child is ever absent.</p>
                              <p class="style5">Shakira said that the only way to break the cycle of poverty is to provide good quality education to the children of the world.</p>
                              <p class="style5">Speaking on the occasion Congresswoman Nita Lowey (D-NY) said that even in this times of recession US economy can meet the additional cost of providing all children in the US and the world good quality full time education. She said that providing education is an essential pillar of our foreign policy today as it is directly linked to peace and security imperative.</p>
                              <p class="style5">Gene Sperling, Chair, Campaign for Education, USA said that it is worth contemplating that the US share in the funding on education is one fifth of the share of UK as they invest about close to one and a half billion annually. US should take the leadership by enhancing the aid to global education compact</p>

                              <p align="justify" class="style5">It will unite millions of children, teachers, parents and campaigners  across the globe in their attempt to break the world record, and ensure  everyone has an education.&nbsp; Politicians, officials and journalists will be  taught, alongside children and parents, on <strong>Quality Education to End  Exclusion.</strong></p>
                              <p align="justify" class="style5"><strong>The Action Plan </strong><br>
                                A simple action that we hope will unite all the GCE  coalitions around the world. We want to send as many politicians as we can <em>Back  to School</em> so they can learn about the education crisis and the importance  of EFA. Halfway to the 2015 targets the Education For All goals are way off  track and we want to pressurize as many politicians as we can about the need  for urgent action. </p>
                              <p class="style5">Schools and local groups can take part in one of two  ways: </p>

                                <li>Inviting  a politician to visit them and take part in a lesson along with local media</li>
                                <li>By  producing messages on education for all and sending them to a politician</li>

                              <p class="style5">The lesson here is intended for teachers and those who will be teaching the  World's Biggest Lesson.</p>
                              <p class="style5">Remember the World's Biggest Lesson should be taught on Wednesday 23rd April  2008, at either 4am GMT, 8am GMT or 3pm GMT.&nbsp; Anyone can take part.</p>
