<h3><a name="1">1. Survive</a></h3><br />
Sometimes I feel alone in a million crowd<br />
An outsider wandering alone without<br />
Any words to say<br />
They can't explain<br />
The desire to overcome the pain<br />
Feel the breath that's always getting away from me<br />
<br />
Am I dreaming it all?<br />
I will never be afraid<br />
<br />
I'll survive in this nothing, leading nowhere.<br />
I survive, feeling strong for how much longer?<br />
I'll survive in this nothing leading nowhere<br />
I survive<br />
<br />
A voice inside of me<br />
That keeps on teasing<br />
As sweet as like a whisper from the lips of pain<br />
And so many steps that I can't make<br />
I can't take the chance, release the brake<br />
And the breath just keeps on getting away<br />
<br />
Am I dreaming it all?<br />
I will never be afraid<br />
<br />
I'll survive in this nothing, leading nowhere.<br />
I survive, feeling strong for how much longer?<br />
I'll survive in this nothing leading nowhere<br />
I survive<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="2">2. I Won't Tell You</a></h3><br />
I cannot tell you you're falling apart<br />
Open your eyes if you wanna survive<br />
I want to tell you your love is a lie<br />
But I won't tell you, I won't tell you.<br />
<br />
I can't leave this, I am fine inside it<br />
I don't feel bliss and I just keep hiding<br />
I've been burnt so badly but I still play with fire<br />
Sometimes naked truth is what I don't believe in<br />
I cannot tell you you're falling apart<br />
Open your eyes if you wanna survive<br />
I want to tell you your love is a lie<br />
But I won't tell you, I won't tell you<br />
<br />
I cannot get so deep into this now<br />
I can't admit that I know what I know and<br />
I want to tell you your love is a lie<br />
I won't tell you, I won't tell you<br />
<br />
It's hard to hear through the static again<br />
It's never clear until the rush of pain<br />
I'll never tell you I'm living a lie<br />
In this confusion I feel alive<br />
I've been burnt so bad but I still play with fire<br />
Sometimes naked truth is what I can't believe in<br />
<br />
Don't ever tell me I'm falling apart<br />
Don't ever tell me I will not survive<br />
Sometimes naked truth is what I can't believe in<br />
Don't ever tell me I'm falling apart<br />
Don't ever tell me I will not survive<br />
Don't ever tell me this love is a lie<br />
Cause I'm the lie, I'm the liar<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="3">3. Not Enough</a></h3><br />
I don't want to be saved,<br />
I want to go down with you<br />
Together we will find a way to come back<br />
Come back, come back<br />
<br />
I don't want to be saved,<br />
I want to go down with you<br />
Together we will find a way to come back<br />
<br />
I thought it was too late<br />
I thought you disappeared<br />
It's been a while since I believed in you<br />
I used to have the strength<br />
I used to just walk away<br />
But now that I see you<br />
It's not enough, it's not enough<br />
<br />
I don't want to be saved,<br />
I want to go down with you<br />
Together we will find a way to come back<br />
<br />
I'm falling once again, I'm following the way<br />
Nothing changed since I believed in you<br />
I knew that it would come,<br />
I thought that I'd be afraid<br />
But now that I have you<br />
It's not enough, it's not enough<br />
<br />
I don't want to be saved,<br />
I want to go down with you<br />
Together we will find a way to come back<br />
<br />
Forgotten fears<br />
I'd throw away all the caution out unto the wind<br />
My soul is thirsty, and I'm still dreaming of you<br />
Get out of my mind<br />
<br />
Come back (Get out of my mind),<br />
Come back (Get out of my mind)<br />
<br />
I don't want to be saved,<br />
I want to go down with you<br />
Together we will find a way to come back<br />
<br />
I don't want to be saved,<br />
I want to give into you<br />
Together we will find a way to come back<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="4">4. I'm Not Afraid</a></h3><br />
Watch your back<br />
Because I am coming closer<br />
Shivers down your spine<br />
You were not expecting me<br />
<br />
How does it feel to be faced in your territory?<br />
Are you afraid to see me here?<br />
<br />
I'm not afraid<br />
To take my time, to live my life<br />
The way I want to<br />
I'm not afraid<br />
To take you down and live my life as I want to<br />
I'm not afraid<br />
<br />
Closer but apart<br />
No one else can hear us<br />
Get out of the car<br />
Did you want to leave without me?<br />
<br />
How does it feel to be faced in your territory?<br />
Are you afraid to see me here?<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="5">5. I Like It</a></h3><br />
Everything is different today<br />
I like it, like it<br />
I feel different today<br />
I like it, like it<br />
<br />
I'm not gonna be in your parade<br />
Cause I don't like it<br />
You think I'm a dirty little game<br />
You think I like it<br />
You made up this fantasy with me<br />
But I don't like it.<br />
<br />
I want you to get away from me<br />
That's how I like it<br />
How do you like it?<br />
<br />
Today I'm gonna fly<br />
There's nothing that can keep me on the ground<br />
Touch the sky<br />
I'm free inside.<br />
<br />
You think you're the master, I'm the slave<br />
You think I like it<br />
You don't even know me anyway<br />
That's how I like it.<br />
<br />
I'm getting ready to move on<br />
But you don't like it<br />
You can kiss your fairy tale away<br />
I like it, like it<br />
How do you like it<br />
<br />
I'm free to do what I like<br />
I'm celebrating my life<br />
I'm free to be what I like<br />
I'm celebrating my life<br />
I'm gonna get what I like<br />
I'm gonna celebrate 'till I die<br />
I'm celebrating my life.<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="6">6. Underdog</a></h3><br />
You are going down<br />
Down<br />
<br />
At the bottom I have found<br />
I cannot wait to get back in the fight<br />
<br />
And send you straight to the ground<br />
Hide and seek<br />
When I'm on the ropes<br />
You wanna knock me down, knock me down<br />
Your cheap shots are  denied<br />
<br />
You're going down<br />
You can't kill my soul and kill me dream<br />
Back down<br />
Now<br />
You will understand me now<br />
You don't want to come back to the fight<br />
I've been the underdog all my life<br />
I can feel it<br />
I will not stop until I see you down<br />
On the ground<br />
Cause I am still alive<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="7">7. The Pain</a></h3><br />
I wake up to a smoking gun<br />
The evidence in your head<br />
There's no proof of guilt or innocence<br />
<br />
I'm finished with you taking me through<br />
A line of questioning that feeds you<br />
<br />
I must confess I'm here to kill the pain<br />
To kill the pain<br />
What can I do?<br />
How hard I fight<br />
No matter how<br />
How long I've tried<br />
<br />
The sword of justice in my hand<br />
You cut me down, sharp like a blade<br />
You make me want to never trust again<br />
<br />
I'm finished with you dragging me through<br />
More lies and deceit that feeds you<br />
<br />
I must confess I'm here to kill the pain<br />
Doesn't matter, if it mattered<br />
I would never have tried<br />
To save us both from losing our minds<br />
Doesn't matter<br />
You shatter me now<br />
<br />
I have to get away<br />
The rain comes<br />
The rain comes<br />
Nothing gonna buy you time<br />
The rain comes<br />
The rain comes<br />
You know its gonna come<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="8">8. Spellbound</a></h3><br />
Burning here, in the room<br />
Feeling that the walls are moving closer<br />
Silent scene the dark takes me<br />
Leads me to the ending of another day<br />
I'm haunted<br />
<br />
Tell me who you are. I am spellbound<br />
You cannot have this control on me<br />
Everywhere I go I am spellbound<br />
I will break the spell you put on me<br />
<br />
Velvet drapes, glowing candles<br />
Silent whispers of words inside of my head<br />
The night that comes, it waits for me<br />
Lift me to the ending of another day<br />
I'm haunted<br />
<br />
Tell me who you are. I am spellbound<br />
You cannot have this control on me<br />
Everywhere I go I am spellbound<br />
I will break the spell you put on me<br />
<br />
Tell me who you are. I am spellbound<br />
You cannot have this control on me<br />
Everywhere I go I am spellbound<br />
I will break the spell you put on me<br />
<br />
Everywhere I go I am spellbound<br />
Everywhere I go I am spellbound<br />
Everywhere I go I am spellbound<br />
I will break the spell you put on me<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="9">9. Wide Awake</a></h3><br />
The rebel inside<br />
A mind of my own<br />
I haven't felt right<br />
Since the moment I gave up<br />
I challenged my limits<br />
I'm feeling I'm becoming limitless<br />
I take it all in and inhale<br />
<br />
I'm wide awake<br />
I open my eyes and the sky is so blue all of a sudden<br />
I know that I treasure my life<br />
I find myself<br />
Wide awake<br />
Like you<br />
The struggle within<br />
Now I understand freedom begins<br />
When you get out of the cage you built<br />
It looks like I'm crazy but I'm not the only one<br />
To believe in myself, believe in myself<br />
I won't be coming undone<br />
Cause I feel like<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="10">10. The Maze</a></h3><br />
My thoughts can be so vicious<br />
Committed to a plan<br />
The fear becomes ambitious<br />
Taking me till I am gone<br />
<br />
I don't know how it started<br />
Beating up myself<br />
I've come to realize<br />
I can barely carry on each day<br />
This life is so destructive it's blowing out my mind<br />
My breath is running so short<br />
<br />
I'm lost here (deep inside)<br />
In this maze<br />
I'm running through the halls of emptiness<br />
In this maze<br />
I can't find a way to get back to the end<br />
In this maze<br />
I'm feeling like I'm stuck inside a cage<br />
In this maze I won't feel the breeze 'till I break this maze and run<br />
<br />
I don't know how it started<br />
Thinking to myself<br />
I've come to realize<br />
I couldn't carry on each day<br />
This vibe is so destructive<br />
I'm smoking up my mind<br />
So by the time she left<br />
I was lost here<br />
(Deep inside)<br />
Will I ever see the sun?<br />
Shining through the prison clouds<br />
<br />
In the darkness you can hide<br />
Go inside, free your mind<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="11">11. Unchained</a></h3><br />
There is nothing up ahead<br />
Or down the road<br />
The streets won't last forever<br />
There is nothing left to loose<br />
I cannot see<br />
Myself inside this dream<br />
I know<br />
Nothing lasts forever<br />
Nothing lasts forever<br />
<br />
Unchained<br />
I'm like a bullet set free now<br />
Unchained<br />
I'm like a weapon unleashed now<br />
<br />
Now I've found my way<br />
To solid ground<br />
I left behind the feeling<br />
That I've been a fool<br />
I feel much stronger now<br />
I am not the same<br />
You know<br />
Nothing lasts forever<br />
Nothing lasts forever<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="12">12. Shallow Life</a></h3><br />
I never thought I'd be the soldier<br />
I take my place inside the battle<br />
I've come to realize the journey is over<br />
Realize that life is sober<br />
Everyday I'm like a soldier<br />
Waking up within the battle<br />
And through the haze I live a dream<br />
That's better<br />
 than what I feel inside<br />
Diggin' in me<br />
Suffering darkness in my eyes<br />
Against the light of Rome<br />
I see the reflection of the ghost that I've become<br />
Waiting behind the windows<br />
I resign to be alone<br />
I want to feel alone<br />
And lost in this solitude<br />
<br />
Shallow life<br />
I'll stay close to the ground<br />
Shallow life<br />
The walls keep falling down<br />
I close my eyes<br />
I'll find my way around<br />
In the shallow life<br />
<br />
Welcome to the bottom line<br />
Suffering darkness in my eyes<br />
Against the night of Rome<br />
I get confused and all I hear is just I<br />
I will resign and search for peace of mind<br />
I'm on my own<br />
I need to be alone<br />
And lost in this solitude<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="13">13. Oblivion</a></h3><br />
<i>[Bonus track]</i><br />
<br />
It's a fairy tale and the story is out of date<br />
Nothing that I haven't tried to say<br />
You know that the road is lonely<br />
I will need some help<br />
You know that this life is crazy<br />
I will need some help<br />
<br />
There's a place far below<br />
The darkness deep within<br />
It's a place, I don't belong<br />
Come set me free from this oblivion<br />
<br />
All inside of me<br />
On the edge of agony<br />
Nothing left for me that I can fake<br />
You know that the road is lonely<br />
I will need some help<br />
You know that this life is crazy<br />
I will need some help<br />
<br />
And I keep wandering away<br />
I'm so deep in disarray<br />
<br />
There's a place far below<br />
The darkness deep within<br />
It's a place, I don't belong<br />
Come set me free<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="14">14. The Last Goodbye</a></h3><br />
<i>[Japanese bonus track]</i><br />
<br />
Whatever you did to me<br />
You gotta, you gotta tell me now<br />
Why do we look like strangers?<br />
Whatever I did to you<br />
No excuses for this silence<br />
Tell me what you're thinking I'll be there for you<br />
<br />
So many stories told, too many useless words<br />
Maybe because it's getting dark inside<br />
<br />
This is the last goodbye<br />
These broken dreams have been resigned<br />
Here's to our last goodnight<br />
These broken dreams have been resigned<br />
<br />
Will this set us both free?<br />
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta<br />
Tell me what you're thinking 'cause I just don't understand it<br />
Whatever I did to you<br />
No excuses for this silence<br />
Tell me what you're thinking I'll be listening<br />
<br />
So many stories told, too many useless words<br />
Maybe because it's getting dark inside<br />
<br />
This is the last goodbye<br />
These broken dreams have been resigned<br />
Here's to our last goodnight<br />
These broken dreams have been resigned<br />
<br />
Why should I care when it will be alright?<br />
Once separate ways we'll feel alive again<br />
So many stories told, too many useless words<br />
Maybe because it's getting dark inside<br />
<br />
This is the last goodbye<br />
These broken dreams have been resigned<br />
Here's to our last goodnight<br />
These broken dreams have been resigned<br />
<br />
The last goodbye<br />
The last goodbye<br />
The last goodbye<br />
The last goodbye<br />
<br /><br />
<h3><a name="15">15. Leaving Alone</a></h3><br />
<i>[Deluxe Edition bonus track]</i><br />
<br />
Here today, I think I must have changed my mind<br />
as I'm looking at things from a different side<br />
I get up and fight off, the guilt last night<br />
pushing back the fear<br />
I will be my guide no one by my side<br />
the only road, just me myself and I<br />
<br />
I'm leaving alone tonight<br />
I'm leaving the trust behind<br />
I'm leaving alone tonight<br />
I'm leaving it all behind<br />
<br />
let the journey start, I finally freed myself<br />
from the jealousy and revenge I have felt<br />
I got out in time and I'm moving fine<br />
I'll live to tell the tale<br />
I will be my guide, no one by my side<br />
this fearless road, just me myself and I<br />
<br />
I can't awake this, it has slowly faded<br />
you have made me feel so understated<br />
this is the hurt that you have knowingly created<br />
we have now become so overrated<br />
<br /><br />
