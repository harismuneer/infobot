<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Many people in northern Afghanistan (ethnic Uzbeks, Tadjiks) did not support the <a href="af_talib.html">Taliban</a>. In 1991 general-colonel <a href="af}dostm.html">Abdul Rashid Dostum</a> created an anti-Taliban division. In 1992 he and <a href="af}masod.html">Ahmad-shah Massood</a> created the government of North Afghanistan and the <a href="af}dostm.html#gov">People's Muslim Movement of Afghanistan</a>. (...)<i><br>
Victor Lomantsov</i>, 5 April 2001</p>

<p>I think that black-red-green flags were used by different factions of today's <i>Northern Alliance</i> as their party flags. Thus they were not flags of <i>North Afghanistan</i> &#151; which, naturally, does not exist as a political unit. After re-unification of all anti-Taleban parties, they became to (re)use the
national flag (<a href="af1992d.html">green-white-black</a>).<i><br>
Jan Zrzavy</i>, 9 October 2001</p>

<p>I agree with <i>Jan Zrzavy</i>'s statement, that <a href="af}dostm.html#gov">Dostum's North Afghanistan flag</a> was most probably only the flag of one of the main factions of the Northern Alliance, the <a href="af}dostm.html">Uzbeks</a> under Dostum. (...) The other main faction of the Northern Alliance (the <a href="af}masod.html">Tadjiks</a>) was headed by Ahmed Shah Massood. We have seen the use of the <a href="af1992d.html">green-white-black</a> national flag of 1992 as their flag (with variations, though). As the internationally recognized government (until 22 December 2001 at least) was headed by Burhanuddin Rabbani, another Tadjik, it is not surprising that the Tadjik faction used this flag.</p>
<p>So most probably there had been at least two flags used by the Northern Alliance, at least for some time. If they agreed on a common flag at a later date, is in my opinion unclear. It is also unclear, if other factions of the Northern Alliance (e.g. the <a href="af}hazar.html">Hazara</a>) used their own flags.<i><br>
Marcus Schm&ouml;ger</i>, 19 December 2001</p>

<p>Journalist Christophe de Pontilly, who is authoritative on Afghan matters and was a close friend of the late Commandant Massood, explained on <i>France-Inter</i>, 14 October 2002, that the name <i>Northern Alliance</i> was absolutely erroneous and was never coined by Massood. The real name of Massood's movement was <i>United National Front for the Salute of Afghanistan</i>. <i>Northern Alliance</i> is particularly unsuitable since Massood's movement was not restricted to the north of the country. Moreover, the often claimed opposition between Massood in the north and the Talibans in the south is an oversimplification of the situation.<i><br>
