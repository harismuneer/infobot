														<p>How much tax, if any, should we pay on capital gains?</p>
<p>This question has received renewed attention recently in light of the discussions south of the border regarding whether taxes should be raised on the wealthiest one per cent, who generate a significant portion of their annual earnings through tax-preferred capital gains.</p>
<p>In the U.S., long-term capital gains (i.e. gains on property held more than one year) are currently taxed at a flat rate of 15% (as are dividends) versus the top U.S. federal tax rate of 35% payable on ordinary income. President Obama’s proposed “Buffett Rule” would impose a 30% tax on anyone earning more than $  1-million annually, no matter what the source of that income is, including long-term capital gains.<span id="more-165227"></span>

<p>You’ll also recall the fury which erupted over the release of likely Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney’s tax returns earlier this year. His 2010 return showed an effective federal tax rate of only 13.9% on gross income of $  21.6-million, attributed largely to the fact that he earned more than half of this income in the form of dividends and carried interest (his share of profits from his private equity interests, which are taxed under U.S. law as long term capital gains), both taxed at 15%.</p>
<div style="width:200px;float:right;background:#FFFFFF;margin:10px;padding:15px;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#3366ff;"><strong><span style="font-size:1.45em;line-height:1.4em;">Theoretically, the inflation component associated with a growth in an asset’s value shouldn’t be taxed</span></strong></span></p>
</div>
<p>Canada’s rate on capital gains varies based on your marginal tax bracket, but is 50% of your ordinary income rate. For high income Canadians who earn more than $  132,406 in 2012, the top federal tax rate on capital gains, whether the property is held for a day or a decade, is 14.5%, just slightly below the general long-term U.S. federal capital gains rate. State or provincial taxes vary widely but typically increase the total combined capital gains tax rate for top income earners to 20% or slightly higher.</p>
<p>Recall that Canada didn’t use to tax capital gains at all. The genesis of our capital gains tax began with the Carter commission report which led to the major tax reform of 1971 with the result that capital gains became taxable as of January 1, 1972.</p>
<p>While the Carter commission recommended full taxation of capital gains, the law, as originally introduced, only taxed 50% of capital gains. The inclusion rate was increased to 75% in 1990 and that inclusion rate stayed constant for about a decade. In February 2000, the rate was reduced down to two thirds, which lasted until October 2000, where it was dropped back to 50%, where it has remained to this day.</p>
<p>Some capital gains are still entirely tax-free. Consider the principal residence exemption, introduced as part of tax reform, which exempts the full gain on your residence from tax. Similarly, in 2006, the government introduced a permanent exemption from capital gains tax for donations of appreciated securities to a registered charity.</p>
<p>The other category of tax-free gains is in the form of the lifetime capital gains exemption. While each Canadian used to be entitled to a $  100,000 lifetime exemption from capital gains tax, this general exemption, introduced by the Conservatives in 1984 lasted for only ten years, until being repealed by the Liberals in 1994.</p>
<p>Today, the lifetime capital gains exemption is only available to farmers, fishers or shareholders of qualified small business corporations who can avoid tax on up to $  750,000 of capital gain on the sale or disposition of these properties.</p>
<p>So, why the favourable rate for capital gains?</p>
<p>While it’s widely believed that the primary reason for taxing capital gains at favourable rates is to encourage individuals to take risks with their accumulated capital, thereby growing the economy in the process through job creation and a lower cost of capital, there may be far more fundamental reasons for having a preferred rate.</p>
<p>Consider inflation. Theoretically, the inflation component associated with a growth in an asset’s value shouldn’t be taxed since it doesn’t truly represent an economic increase in the owner’s real wealth. For example, say you buy stock which pays no dividends but is expected to grow in value by 5%. Given our ten-year average inflation rate of 2%, the real yield, pre-tax, is 3%. But our capital gains system taxes the entire 5% gain, not just the real gain of 3%, so effectively you end up paying tax on the inflation component of the stock’s appreciation.</p>
<p>Of course the same inflation argument can be made to justify a lower rate of taxation on interest income. Prior to 1988, Canada used to exempt the first $  1,000 of annual Canadian interest income from tax. Lower-income Canadians, who tend to have more of their investments in fixed income than equities, were unduly penalized by the repeal of this deduction and continue to face full taxation of interest income, with no inflationary adjustment.</p>
<p>Another reason to favour a lower tax rate for capital gains, particularly on common shares, has to do with the double taxation inherent with corporately-earned income. While this problem is generally solved for corporate income that is taxed inside the corporation and subsequently paid out as a dividend by way of the gross-up and dividend tax credit mechanism, it’s more of an issue with corporate retained earnings.</p>
<p>A company that chooses to retain, rather than distribute its after-tax corporate profits to shareholders in the form of a dividend will, all things being equal, grow the value of the company by the amount of retained earnings. This increase in value would be reflected in the share price meaning that a shareholder who faced full taxation on that gain, would essentially be paying tax a second time on the same corporate earnings. Taxing such gains at 50% attempts to mitigate this double taxation.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it’s clear that the capital gains tax, just like any other tax on investment income, is essentially a double tax on savings, such that the choice to defer consumption to a later period in one’s life is subject to tax in a way that current consumption is not. Strategic saving through an RRSP or TFSA can avoid this double tax problem altogether. <a href="mailto:Jamie.Golombek@cibc.com" target="_blank"><br />

														<p>They don’t have a financial plan. Some of them can’t even claim a day job. But Marvel Comics, teaming up with Visa Canada, has produced a comic depicting superheroes teaching us to be super savers.</p>
<p>The Avengers comic “Saving the Day” will become available on Thursday as part of Superhero Week April 23-27. The aim is to introduce children to basic money concepts such as budgeting, saving and banking.</p>
<p>Visa Canada notes that its own studies show 31% of children 12-18 receive their information about how to manage their finances from school with the rest left to look to other resources.</p>
<p>The comic follows Spider-Man as he joins up with the Avengers to tackle Mole Man while managing to sneak in a few lessons on the banking system.</p>
<p>The <em>Financial Post</em> asked a comic book expert, a financial planner and a senior wealth management advisor to look at how these superheroes and villains rank in the financial literacy department. It turns out Spider-Man needs to think about caring for his elderly aunt, Iron Man needs to get serious about getting charitable and it might be time for Mole Man to put something away for a rainy day. <strong><em>— SCROLL OVER IMAGE BELOW TO READ MORE</em></strong></p>

														<p>Toronto condo dwellers Martha and Kim are overwhelmed by their investments — two dozen mutual funds, many with overlapping stocks, portfolios with life insurance features sold as segregated funds, a rental condo, and $  3,500 they keep as an emergency reserve to care for a beloved Husky and a calico cat.</p>
<p>Their spending is not the problem, even though the $  650 they lay out each month for things like doggie daycare, veterinary insurance and obedience training is generous. Apart from indulging their pets, Martha and Kim live relatively simply. “We spend the money so that the animals will be able to get out and breathe fresh air every day. It’s the price of being a good pet owner in the urban jungle.”</p>
<p>Martha, 44, is a manager in financial services, and Kim, 41, is a supervisor in a communications company. Together they bring home $  10,500 a month after tax and add about $  250 a month net after-tax income from a condo they rent out for six months of the year, for total monthly disposable income of $  10,750.</p>

<p><span id="more-165201"></span>Family Finance asked Benoit Poliquin, an Ottawa-based financial planner and portfolio manager, to help Martha and Kim rebalance and simplify their tangled investments.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-165594 alignleft" title="0420ff" src="http://financialpostbusiness.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/0420ff.jpg?w=319&#038;h=671" alt="" width="319" height="671" />Martha and Kim bought their second condo — valued at $  265,000 with a $  196,000 mortgage — for visiting friends and family, kind of an elaborate guest suite. It has become so popular an idea that their neighbours are renting it for their friends and it is gainfully occupied six months of the year. But the rental income is just sitting in cash rather than paying down the $  58,000 mortgage on the $  285,000 condo they themselves live in or to catch up on unused RRSP space.</p>
<p>The condo earns $  1,500 rent less $  923 mortgage payments and $  100 in other costs. That leaves a net return of $  477 on $  69,000 of equity, 7.3% on just six months income. It’s a decent investment that could appreciate over time, Mr. Poliquin says.</p>
<p>The remainder of their financial assets is a buffet of high-fee mutual funds. Most of Canada’s largest insurance companies and banks have their products represented in the couple’s long list of funds. The reason is in part the previous jobs that Martha and Kim have held. Their employer-sponsored RRSPs have to stay, but the others, souvenirs of their past professional lives, could be shifted to low-fee exchange-traded funds. The saving would shave 2% off about $  200,000 of fund assets, or $  4,000 a year. In 20 years, assuming a 3% after-inflation return, that would build up the startling sum of $  110,706. That alone could add $  3,320 to their pre-tax retirement income. That’s a big reward for cutting complexity and refocusing investment strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Restructuring portfolios</strong></p>
<p>Martha and Kim can adjust their portfolio to have 30% Canadian dividend ETFs, 40% dividend-paying foreign stocks, and 30% Canadian bonds from major corporate issuers, Mr. Poliquin suggests. The largest part of the investments will be inside the couple’s RRSPs. They will not benefit from the dividend tax credit on Canadian-source dividends. On the other hand, they will not be penalized for holding non-Canadian dividend-paying stocks.</p>
<p>Martha and Kim can shop for ETFs that have 10-year investment-grade corporate bonds. They continue to pay yields of 3.3% to 4.5% and, in the 10-year segment of the market, yields are not far from their historical averages, Mr. Poliquin adds. With the help of an investment advisor who can guide them through the complexities of the corporate bond market, the couple could also make direct purchases of a handful of bonds of different issuers. As interest rates rise, the market value of these bonds will drop, but they will pay face value at maturity and will sustain their current or running yields until then.</p>
<p>The question is where to put investments — in RRSPs or TFSAs. If the money goes into RRSPs, it will eventually be paid out as taxable income. TFSA withdrawals are not considered income for tax purposes. If the RRIF payouts together with other income are too large, they may trigger the OAS clawback. TFSA payouts don’t do that. They do not produce taxable income, Mr. Poliquin says.</p>
<p>They will qualify for two CPP benefits of $  11,840 a year payable at age 65 and two OAS pensions payable when each is 67 at $  6,481 a year, all in 2012 dollars. If they can add, as they are doing, $  19,200 a year to RRSPs, for 25 years and achieve a 3% rate of asset growth with the present $  190,700 of RRSPs, TFSAs and a locked-in retirement account (LIRA), their registered investments will have a value of about $  1,099,000 when Kim begins her 66th year.</p>
<p>Paid out at about 6% a year, that investment capital could add $  69,958 to annual income, pushing the total for the couple to about $  106,600 a year before tax. Divided by two, each would have $  53,300 before tax, well below the OAS clawback trigger point in 2012, $  69,562. If taxed at an average 20% rate, they would have $  7,106 a month to spend, 66% of their present disposable income.</p>
<p>“The critical element in this retirement forecast is building up investment income through contributions and asset growth. That takes a commitment which, in time, will produce a substantial return with less than average stock market risk,” Mr. Poliquin says.</p>

														<p>Households in the U.S. may remain intent on repairing tattered finances by rebuilding savings for years to come as the specter of job losses and meltdown in stocks triggered by the recession lingers.</p>
<p>Americans are putting money away at a pace more than double that leading up to the economic slump. The saving rate has averaged 4.8% since June 2009, when the 18-month contraction ended, compared with 2.2% in the three years leading up the downturn.</p>
<p>“Households are going to be mired in this deleveraging environment for a few more years,” Ellen Zentner, a senior U.S. economist at Nomura Securities International Inc. in New York, said in a telephone interview. “That’s not atypical following a financial crisis.”</p>
<p>Almost three years into the recovery, the world’s largest economy has yet to regain even half the 8.8 million jobs lost and US$  16.4-trillion in household net worth washed away as a result of the worst recession since the 1930s. While the saving rate has dropped recently, longer term the need to boost cash reserves and pay down debt may eclipse the urge to be the first on the block to drive the newest model car.<br />

<p><strong>Auto Demand</strong></p>
<p>Pent-up demand for automobiles helped propel a 0.8% gain in consumer spending in February, the biggest in seven months, according to Commerce Department data. The pickup carried over into March as figures this week showed retail sales also advanced 0.8%, reflecting stepped-up purchases of furniture, clothes and electronics.</p>
<p>Stronger earnings, reflecting in part the recent pickup in sales, are boosting share prices. The Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.4% to 1,382.32 at 10:03 a.m. in New York. General Electric Co., Microsoft Corp. and Schlumberger Ltd. reported profits that topped analysts’ estimates.</p>
<p>Shares were also boosted by better economic news elsewhere. A report showed German business confidence unexpectedly increased in April for a sixth month,</p>
<p>The increase in consumer spending in the U.S. pushed the saving rate down to 3.7% in February, the lowest in more than two years and matching the level in August 2009 as the weakest of the current expansion, Commerce Department data show.</p>
<p>Such profligacy will probably not go unchecked, according to analysts like Guy LeBas.</p>
<p><strong>Ideal Range</strong></p>
<p>“A savings rate in the neighbourhood of 5% is one that would allow consumers to prepare for long-term obligations and yet will support the economy in the short-term,” said LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The recent decline in the rate is a sign that some households are gaining confidence about their economic prospects even as they become more vulnerable to unexpected shocks. Yet, the ups and downs of the job market underscore the need for a higher personal saving rate, LeBas said.</p>
<p>“If the labour markets are volatile, you have a higher chance of losing your job and, therefore, as an individual you need to save more,” he said.</p>
<p>Last month was a case in point. Employers added 120,000 workers to payrolls, less than the lowest estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and the poorest showing in five months, Labor Department figures showed. The jobless rate dropped to a three-year low of 8.2% as some of the unemployed stopped looking for work.</p>
<p><strong>Fist-Hand Knowledge</strong></p>
<p>Andrew Hedberg, a Minneapolis resident who’s been without a job since losing a seasonal position at Macy’s Inc. about a year ago, is among those knowing first-hand the importance of having money stowed away.</p>
<p>“I’ve had to dip into my savings,” said Hedberg, 38. “I’m certainly glad that I had savings available to me because not everyone does. It bolsters my belief that savings is the best investment, like an insurance policy that I can make for myself.”</p>
<div style="width:200px;float:right;background:#FFFFFF;margin:10px;padding:15px;">
<p style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#3366ff;"><strong><span style="font-size:1.45em;line-height:1.4em;">Savings is the best investment, like an insurance policy that I can make for myself</span></strong></span></p>
</div>
<p>By keeping borrowing costs low to spur spending and growth, Federal Reserve policy makers have had a hand in the recent decrease in the rate at which nest eggs are rebuilt, said LeBas. Near-zero interest rates on savings accounts reduce the opportunity cost of putting that cash to work, he said.</p>
<p>“The Federal Reserve, with its low-rate policy, has been subsidizing consumers’ ability to spend by reducing the desire to save,” said LeBas. The central bank “has actually been more effective than most people recognize in that they’ve really convinced consumers to spend rather than save, thereby supporting short-term economic activity,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Fed’s Influence</strong></p>
<p>Fed policy makers have kept their benchmark rate near zero since December 2008. Central bank officials have said they plan to keep interest rates low through late 2014.</p>
<p>The recent decline in the saving rate, the share of after-tax income that Americans are able to sock away, including individual retirement accounts and 401(k)s, may also be a statistical mirage that will eventually be revised away, according to economists like Stuart Hoffman. That indicates spending may not decelerate.</p>
<p>“They’ll probably revise the savings rate back up,” Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group Inc. in Pittsburg, said in an interview. “I don’t believe you’re going to see consumer spending die out.”</p>
<p>Revisions to gross domestic product figures on Feb. 29 showed wages and salaries from July through September rose US$  107.2-billion, up from the US$  24.8-billion gain initially reported. Updates issued last month showed they climbed another US$  89.1-billion in the fourth quarter, up from an initial estimate of US$  66.1-billion.</p>
<p><strong>Baby-Boom Bias</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, while initial contributions to IRAs and 401(k)s are included in savings, the capital gains from those funds are not. That means the rate will probably be held down over the next decade as the Baby Boom generation retires and starts spending those proceeds.</p>
<p>Other economists, such as Ken Mayland, believe the current pace of household spending is unsustainable.</p>
<p>“Consumers have been working down their personal savings rate to sustain a spending style,” Mayland, president of ClearView Economics LLC in Pepper Pike, Ohio, said in a telephone interview. “That can only go on so long.”</p>

														<p>Home Capital Group Inc. said it’s capturing mortgage business from Canadian lenders including Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce that are retreating from the $  200 billion nonprime market amid signs of a housing downturn.</p>
<p>“The big banks are sort of juggling around their mortgage strategy and as part of that, they’re tightening up in certain areas,” Home Capital President Martin Reid said in an interview. “We’re seeing some of the fallout.”</p>
<p>Canada’s banks have been exercising more caution on higher- risk mortgages after Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney warned that record household debt remains the biggest domestic risk to the economy. Carney this week signalled the potential for interest rate increases that would cool off a housing market that has seen prices almost triple in some Canadian cities over the past decade.</p>

<p>“While interest rates have been at historic lows recently, the inevitable climb looks to be coming as soon as next year,” said Katie Archdekin, head of mortgage products at Bank of Montreal, the country’s fourth-biggest bank.</p>
<p>Home Capital, the Toronto-based mortgage lender, targets the $  200 billion Alt-A market &#8212; uninsured loans to home buyers who often don’t qualify at chartered banks because of their work history or other circumstances. Their clients include self-employed workers and new immigrants to Canada. Higher revenue from loans rejected by banks will add to earnings in Home Capital’s first-quarter results, to be released on May 2.</p>
<p><strong>Credit Scale</strong></p>
<p>“We see opportunities with people that are really high- caliber borrowers with good proof of income, but their circumstances are a little different,” said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Gerald Soloway, who was interviewed with Reid. “We haven’t had to go down the credit scale; we’ve been able to go up the credit scale, which is an unusual phenomenon.”</p>
<p>Banks are paring back loans to below prime borrowers amid signs that housing prices are starting to fall. The Canadian Real Estate Association said April 16 that prices in Canada dropped 1.7% in March from the previous month, led by a 3.1% decline in Vancouver. Finance Minister Jim Flaherty said he’s “encouraged” by signs of a housing correction in Vancouver, preferring the market to “correct itself” without government intervention.</p>
<p>Toronto-Dominion Bank, the country’s second-largest lender, stopped originating non-prime residential mortgages as of March 31, spokesman Mohammed Nakhooda said. The loans, offered through TD Financing Services Home Inc., represented about 0.2% of the bank’s mortgage portfolio.</p>
<p><strong>Risk Appetite</strong></p>
<p>“This decision was based on a number of factors, including a regular review of our secured lending risk management strategies,” Nakhooda said. “To remain competitive in the business in the current environment would require us to increase our risk profile, something we concluded was no longer in our risk appetite.”</p>
<p>Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the country’s fifth- largest bank, said in March it was considering the sale of its FirstLine Mortgages broker. The bank said it wants to shift mortgage renewals into its branch network, where it can sell more products.</p>
<p>Increased risk management has led some banks to reject loans, Reid said.</p>
<p>“Two years ago, they wouldn’t have turned that deal down,” said Reid, 52.</p>
<p><strong>Non-Prime</strong></p>
<p>An influx of non-prime lending will benefit Home Capital, Soloway said. The company is expected to earn $  1.50 a share before one-time items in the first quarter, up from $  1.24 a share a year earlier, according to the average estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.</p>
<p>“We have had a very good first quarter,” said Soloway, who has been CEO for 25 years. “There’s not going to be any surprises, up or down.”</p>
<p>Home Capital focuses on the non-prime market because it can charge a higher premium for loans than most banks after doing more legwork on potential borrowers before approving home loans.</p>
<p>“There’s a little bit of premium, but in some cases, it’s not very much,” said Soloway, 73.</p>
<p>The record consumer debt levels and potential for housing price declines prompted Fitch Ratings on April 9 to revise Home Capital’s credit outlook to negative from stable.</p>
<p><strong>Emerging Concerns</strong></p>
<p>The revision “is based on emerging concerns regarding home price valuations and household debt levels in Canada, which given HCG’s focus on non-conventional borrowers could potentially translate into increased credit costs,” the ratings company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Home Capital had record profit of $  190.1 million last year and adjusted return on equity of 27%. It was the 14th- straight year the company had a return on equity of 20% or higher.</p>
<p>“There is an opportunity for the company to increase its market share without lowering its standards for credit quality,” said Bryan Brown, an analyst at Macquarie Capital Markets in Toronto. He rates Home Capital shares neutral.</p>
<p>Home Capital’s net impaired loans to gross loans were 0.25% at the end of last year, indicating the higher-risk borrowers haven’t led to higher credit losses, according to Fitch’s report. Insured mortgages, which are securitized through Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. bonds, account for 56% of Home Capital’s mortgage book, Fitch said.</p>
<p><strong>Profit Outlook</strong></p>
<p>Home Capital rose 1.7% this year, trailing the 9.6% gain in the Standard &amp; Poor’s/TSX Financials Index.</p>
<p>The company forecast in its annual report that 2012 profit will climb between 13% and 18%, while total loans will rise within the same percentage range.</p>
<p>The other factor that will contribute to first-quarter earnings is a resilient Canadian housing market, Soloway said, dismissing the notion that Canada is in a housing bubble.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there is any sign anywhere from people on the ground in Canada that foresees the bubble,” said Soloway. Economists predicting a collapse in Canada “have been wrong for years; my prediction is that they’re going to be permanently wrong.”</p>
