<P><I>Ci</I> originated during the Tang dynasty as song texts applied to existing melodies. This form reached its fullest development during the Song dynasty, but its popularity continued after that period. Below is some discussion of <I>ci</I> patterns within the context of traditional methods used for pairing lyrics to <I>qin</I> melodies. 

<P><I>Ci</I> lyrics generally do not have regular line lengths (e.g., four characters on each line). Just as the melodies they originally accompanied did not all have the same number of notes on each line, the <I>ci</I> likewise often have a different number of syllables (i.e., Chinese characters) on each line. Unfortunately, all the original melodies are lost. In addition, the original pairing method is not known. Some people assume it was one syllable for each note, as is often thought to have been the case with poems in the <I>Shi Jing</I> (Book of Songs) or with early <I>Yuefu</I> (Music Bureau) lyrics. However, there seems to be no evidence proving such a pairing method was ever used, at least not exclusively used. 

<P>Individual <I>ci</I> lyrics are generally given the title of the original song from which they take their pattern. A well-known example of this would be the numerous eight-line <I>ci</I> said to be "to the tune Endless Longing" (<I>Chang Xiang Si</I>). These generally have the syllabic pattern 3,3.7.5 repeated once. Apparently <I>Chang Xiang Si</I> was originally a song, but long after the melody was lost the lyrics and therefore the syllabic structure remained. The two surviving old <I>qin</I> melodies called <I>Chang Xiang Si</I> both have lyrics with this pattern.<A NAME="r3" HREF="#f3"><SUP><B>3</B></SUP></A>

<P>Logic suggests that the belief that a <I>ci</I> structure could give some clue about the rhythms of the original melody was most likely based on an assumption that the original song had two specific characteristics: not just one note for each syllable, but also a known length for each note.<A NAME="r4" HREF="#f4"><SUP><B>4</B></SUP></A> On the other hand, the pairing method actually used in the Ming dynasty suggests that one might have taken a structure such as the 3,3.7.5 mentioned above and treated these numbers as though they represented not numbers of syllables per phrase, but numbers of what might be called "musical accent points". If one could create rules for determining such accent points within the music or its score, then these accent points might be used in the pairing <I>ci</I> lyrics to music.

<P><A NAME="pairing"><B>Pairing lyrics and music</B>

<P>Ming dynasty tablature pairs lyrics with <I>qin</I> melodies following a formula that in a way finesses the issue of rhythm: instead of aligning the lyrics to a note pattern, the <I>qin</I> tablature aligns them to the points (<I>dian</I>?<A NAME="r5" HREF="#f5"><SUP><B>5</B></SUP></A>) in the tablature where there are the stroke indications. Perhaps this is just a coincidence rather than intentional, but since <I>qin</I> tablature does not directly indicate rhythm, this pairing method finesses the issue of rhythm.<A NAME="r6" HREF="#f6"><SUP><B>6</B></SUP></A>

<P>The system worked more or less as follows (there were inconsistencies). To combine lyrics with a melody, <I>qin</I> tablature applied one Chinese character for each right hand stroke or left hand pluck, but no characters for slides (always done by the left hand). With simple right hand stroke passages this was quite consistent: inconsistencies were largely with the slides and multi-stroke techniques. For example, although characters generally were not applied to left hand slides, occasionally they were;<A NAME="r7" HREF="#f7"><SUP><B>7</B></SUP></A> the tablature generally paired one character to a pluck by the left thumb but some tablature often paired two characters;<A NAME="r8" HREF="#f8"><SUP><B>8</B></SUP></A> and multi-stroke right hand techniques could be paired even more inconsistently, perhaps particularly when a basically instrumental melody had lyrics added to it.<A NAME="r9" HREF="#f9"><SUP><B>9</B></SUP></A> In addition, where the tablature includes the instructions "play again" it is not always clear whether the intention was to sing the phrase on the repeat.<A NAME="r10" HREF="#f10"><SUP><B>10</B></SUP></A> In certain places or times the people writing the tablature or commenting on it may have tried to apply consistent rules to this, but at present such rules can not be determined.<A NAME="r11" HREF="#f11"><SUP><B>11</B></SUP></A> 

<P>Although this pairing method was sometimes criticised,<A NAME="r12" HREF="#f12"><SUP><B>12</B></SUP></A> it seems generally to have been followed for all <I>qin</I> songs prior to the modern period. As a result, almost all <I>qin</I> songs were very word-intensive.

<P>This word to note method was also used in reverse: if tablature for the melody came first, then for each plucked note one character could be applied. Thus the fact that this method could serve to allow people to apply lyrics to melodies that were lost meant that it could also be used for melodies they had never heard: they only had to have copies of the tablature. This may well have been the case for the earliest surviving <I>qin</I> melodies with lyrics, in <I>Zheyin Shizi Qinpu</I> (&lt;1491; see the <A HREF="../02qnpu/09zysz/02zyintr.htm#qinge">commentary</A> as well as 
<A HREF="../02qnpu/07sqmp/07sqlyrc.htm">lyrics</A> that can be applied to <I>Shen Qi Mi Pu</I> melodies). Someone experienced in writing <I>ci</I> lyrics could easily adapt its method (as described <A HREF="#top">above</A>) to the stroke numbers in old <I>qin</I> tablature. 

<P><A NAME="qdpatterns">As for pairing <I>qin</I> tablature to actual <I>ci</I> patterns, one might suspect that this would have been done quite commonly: the resulting melodies could then be applied to any poems following that pattern. As yet, however, I have found only one example of something like this actually being done done: a <A HREF="../02qnpu/26qsdq/qs2122qp.htm#p30"><I>Qin</I> Poem</A> published in 1590 that says its melody can be used with any lyrics with four lines of seven characters each. Instead what one usually gets is the pairing of a variety of melodies (over time) to a single a set of lyrics.<A NAME="r13" HREF="#f13"><SUP><B>13</B></SUP></A>

<P>Some <I>qin</I> melodies that have the names of <I>ci</I> patterns (not all of the melodies are songs) are listed below.<A NAME="r14" HREF="#f14"><SUP><B>14</B></SUP></A>

<B>Everlasting Longing (長相思 <I>Chang Xiang Si</I>): <I>Ci</I> pattern and <I>qin</I> melody</B>
<BR>A study of this one <I>cipai</I> and the <I>qin</I> songs that use it shows some of the difficulties of trying to understand how <I>ci</I> might have been set to <I>qin</I> melodies. To start with basics, 42022.324/3 長相思 first discusses <I>Chang Xiang Si</I> as a section of <A HREF="yfsj.htm"><I>Yuefu Shiji</I></A> (Folio 69; pp. 990-995) having numerous poems of this name, including one by <A HREF="../09hist/qinshi/baijuyi.htm">Bai Juyi<A> (九月西風興....). However, none has the present <I>cipai</I> structure, the most common one being 3,3,7,3,3,5,5,5,5. The one by Bai Juyi is (5+5) x 11.

<P>After this, 42022.324/4 discusses <I>Chang Xiang Si</I> as 詞牌名 the name of a <I>cipai</I>, saying that its pattern came from a poem by Bai Juyi named 汴水流 <I>Bianshui Liu</I> (17525.1 <I>Bianshui</I> river in Henan). This poem is as follows:

<P><DIR>汴水流，泗水流，流到瓜州古渡頭，吳山點點愁。
<BR>思悠悠，恨悠悠，恨到歸時方始休，月明人倚樓。

<P>The Bian waters flow, the Si waters flow; they flow by the ancient Guazhou ferry, and the Wu Mountains bow in sorrow.
<BR>Endless thoughts, endless grief; grief that will have respite only when you return; the moon shines on a person leaning over the balcony.

</DIR><P>The structure here, 3,3,7,5 repeated once, is generally used for later poems called <I>Chang Xiang Si</I>. This includes the two surviving early <I>qin</I> melodies of this name. Zha Guide 35/--/510 lists these in five handbooks: three identical ones in handbooks published in China in 
<A HREF="../02qnpu/00qnpu.htm#p55">1677</A> (XII/364), 
<A HREF="../02qnpu/00qnpu.htm#p56">1677</A> (XII/380) and 
<A HREF="../02qnpu/00qnpu.htm#p86">1802</A> (XVII/545); and two identical ones from late 17th century Japan 
(<A HREF="../02qnpu/00qnpu.htm#p53">XII/216</A> and 
<A HREF="../02qnpu/00qnpu.htm#p66">XII/251</A>). The latter are generally considered to be earlier, brought to Japan from China at the beginning of the Qing dynasty by the monk Jiang Xingchou 
(<A HREF="../09hist/other/toko.htm">Shin-Etsu</A>). However, it is also possible that Shin-Etsu created these melodies after he arrived in Japan.

<P><A NAME="fyslyr">In both Japanese publications the melody has the subtitle <I>Chun Gui</I> (春閨 14146.568 Spring Day in the Boudoir, commonly used as a metaphor for a woman). The lyrics (see <A HREF="../02qnpu/japan/jtocs.htm#h29"><I>Hewen Zhuyin Qinpu</I></A>) are by 馮延巳 Feng Yansi (903? - 960; ICTCL): 

<P><DIR>紅滿枝，綠滿枝，宿雨厭厭睡起遲，閑庭花影移。
<BR>憶歸期，數歸期，夢見雖多相見稀，相逢知幾時。

<P>Red (petals) fill the branches, green fills the branches, 
<BR>&#160; &#160; last night came rain in layers and I am slow to awaken, in the quiet courtyard the appearance of flowers is transformed.
<BR>I recall your expected day of return, many are the expected days of your return,
<BR>&#160; &#160; In dreams although I see you often yet we seldom do see each other: when will I realize our meeting?

</DIR><P><A NAME="wangzhuo">Both the lyrics and music of the version in the three handbooks published in China are completely different from the version preserved in Japan. In the editions from China the lyrics are said to have been added by 王丹麓 Wang Danlu (王晫 Wang Zhuo, 21295.1340: Qing dynasty Hangzhou poet):

<P><DIR>客滿庭，酒滿觥，故斷危弦聲不成，侯門空復情。
<BR>山層層，水泠泠，一曲龍吟萬慮清，風微玄鶴鳴。

<P>Guests fill the room, wine fills the goblets, 
<BR>&#160; &#160; and so when a lofty string breaks the sound does not form, only when the mansion empties do feelings return.
<BR>The mountains are in layers, the rivers are cold, 
<BR>&#160; &#160; (Just playing) the melody 
<A HREF="../02qnpu/25ywqp/yw27sly.htm#longyin">Dragon's Intonation</A> and all my worries are cleared, the air is profound and 
<A HREF="../09hist/qinshi/shikuang.htm#qingzhi">black cranes</A> call out.

</DIR><P>As can be seen, both sets of lyrics follow the common <I>Chang Xiang Si</I> pattern, here arranged as two lines to show their parallel nature. Although each line is patterned 3,3,7,5 repeated, each has different music. A question that must be asked in reconstruction is whether to try to give each line a parallel musical rhythm in accord with the parallel <I>ci</I> pattern. My own inclination, especially given the style of the first two short phrases of each line, is to see not only whether there is a single rhythm that will fit both lines of one poem, but whether there is one that will fit both lines of both poems. This was not done in the reconstructions I have seen by others (i.e., Wang Di, <A HREF="../02qnpu/other.htm#wangdi"><I>Qin Ge</I></A>, p.61 [which has the Japanese melody but changes the lyrics to those of Bai Juyi]; and Wu Wenguang, <A HREF="../02qnpu/00qnpu.htm#p156"><I>Yushan Wushi Qinpu</I></A>, p.445 [a reconstruction of the melody published in China]), but neither one of those includes a discussion giving reasons why or why not.

<P>As mentioned <A HREF="#pairing">above</A>, almost all <I>qin</I> songs pair words to music by a <A HREF="../05poet.htm#syllabic">nearly syllabic method</A> using one character for each right hand stroke and certain left hand plucks. With this as a constant, as any particular melody title continues in the repertoire, several types appear. With long melodies that have lyrics the melodies usually change somewhat from version to version, as do the lyrics, but often it is not clear that these were ever intended to be sung. Most short <I>qin</I> songs of one title are different from this: although the melody may change, or even be completely different in some versions, the lyrics seldom change. <I>Chang Xiang Si</I> is different from both of the above in that both the words and melody are completely different between the two versions. And all of the above types differ from the common <I>ci</I> type, wherein the <I>ci</I> pattern ("melody") remains the same but the words change. Perhaps there was once an oral tradition of creating (perhaps spontaneously) new lyrics for an existing <I>qin</I> song melody, or even of matching existing <I>ci</I> lyrics to a melody that already has different lyrics in the same pattern, but I have not yet found specific evidence for this.

<P>Excluded from the above analysis is the other <I>Chang Xiang Si</I> for <I>qin</I>, but it should be mentioned in case it causes confusion. This is the <I>Chang Xiang Si</I> by 李祥霆 Li Xiangting in Chapter 7 of his 古琴實用教程 <I>Guqin Shiyong Jiaocheng</I> (<I>Guqin</I> Foundation Course). The commentary there says that it comes from the Japanese handbook and that Li 訂指法 drew up the fingering. However, the melody is completely different from that in any of the above handbooks, there are no lyrics, and Li's melody cannot be used for any lyrics that have the <I>ci</I> pattern called <I>Chang Xiang Xi</I>. It is thus somewhat puzzling how he selected the title and why he mentioned the Japanese handbook.

<B>Note values in the original melodies</B>
<BR>As for what the <I>ci</I> structures might say about musical structures, unfortunately I do not have a deep familiarity with this subject and so do not know if anyone has ever tried to analyze it. For example, I have not seen any arguments actually made that the pairing assumed that each syllable had one note of equal or fixed length, that each syllable had a fixed number of notes, or any other permutation on such structured pairing. Nor have I seen arguments that stated simply that if a poetic structure such as 3,3,7,5 fit a certain melody, any poem with that structure should fit that melody, acknowledging that nevertheless this told us nothing about the actual structure of the melody.
<BR>(<A HREF="#r4">Return</A>)

<P><A NAME="dianju"><A NAME="f5"><B>5.</B></A> 
<B><I>Dian</I> 點</B> and <B><I>Ju</I> 句</B>
<BR>In at least one <I>qin</I> handbook, <A HREF="../02qnpu/00qnpu.htm#p79">Yingyang Qinpu</I></A> (which has no melodies with lyrics), the phrasing is emphasized by putting the beginning of each phrase on a separate line, and stating at the beginning of each section of every melody how many <I>ju</I> and how many <I>dian</I></A> it has. These <I>dian</I> seem to correspond to the points on old tablature at which lyrics could be paired</A>, but the aim seemed to be only to help the student learn the melodies correctly. If the aim had been to show how lyrics could be paired, then it would have been more helpful to say how many <I>dian</I> there were in each <I>ju</I>.

<P>Speaking more generally with regard to punctuation of <I>qin</I> melodies, in the same way that early Chinese literary text often had no punctuation, early <I>qin</I> tablature quite likely also had none. Thus, there was no punctuation for many of the melodies in the earliest surviving edition of <I>Shen Qi Mi Pu</I>, <A HREF="../02qnpu/07sqmp/folio1.htm">Folio 1</A>. I do not know what term might have been used for such musical punctuation. "<I>Dianju</I> 點句" (12/1350: dots that stop the continuation of "<I>ju</I>", phrases) is a Chinese term for punctuation that seems to date from the Song dynasty. A more common term is "<I>biaodian</I> 標點" (4/1269: put up marks [dots] to indicate phrases), also with references dating from the Song dynasty.

<B>Pairing words and music</B>
<BR>As discussed above, lyrics are paired by the method of one character for each <A HREF="#dianju"><I>dian</I></A>, apparently defined as any right hand and certain left hand strokes. This pairing method seems to have led to a rather odd situation where lyrics can be paired following this formula but there is no apparently relationship between the lyrics and the musical phrases. Some examples of this are discussed <A HREF="../02qnpu/09zysz/02zyintr.htm#pairing">here</A> (see also the related 
<A HREF="../02qnpu/09zysz/02zyintr.htm#oddityfn">footnote</A>).

<P><A NAME="slidesfn"><A NAME="f7"><B>7.</B></A> 
<B>Inconsistencies within left hand slides</B>
<BR>There are no right-hand slides. Left hand slides include simple up, simple down, multiple up (which could be indicated, e.g., as from the 7th position [<I>hui</I>; stud] go to the 8th then 9th positions, or from the 7th position do a double slide to the 7th position), multiple up, up and down (<I>shang xia</I>), up-down (e.g., <I>zhuang</I>), etc. In some tablature none of these slides have characters paired. Occasionally all do (a note plucked followed by two slides up will be given three characters). Often this is inconsistent. Inconsistency here might suggest that the lyrics and music were once independent of each other, then matched later. 
<BR>(<A HREF="#r7">Return</A>)

<P><A NAME="lhpfn"><A NAME="f8"><B>8.</B></A> 
<B>Inconsistencies within left hand strokes</B>
<BR>Left hand strokes consist largely of "covering" (罨 <A HREF="../02qnpu/05tydq/ty3.htm#tu20"><I>yan</I></A>): bringing the left thumb down on a string while keeping the ring finger in place; and plucking up (搯起 <A HREF="../02qnpu/05tydq/ty3.htm#tu26"><I>taoqi</I></A>): while holding down a position with the left ring finger plucking up or in with the thumb. Generally the technique <I>taoqi</I> seems to be identical to the one called 對起 <I>dui qi</I> (earlier called <A HREF="../02qnpu/05tydq/ty3.htm#tu26"><I>duian</I></A>). However, the &lt;1491 handbook (again see the <A HREF="../02qnpu/09zysz/02zyintr.htm">commentary</A>) generally attached one character to <I>taoqi</I> but two meaningless characters such as 的那 <I>de na</I> to <I>duiqi</I>. Later tablature was more inconsistent here, with the meaningless syllables used less and generally either one or no characters applied to the <I>duiqi</I> or <I>taoqi</I>. 

<P>As for genuine multiple stroke techniques such as 搯撮三聲 <I>taocuo sansheng</I>, these could be assigned a widely varying number of characters, while sometimes there is only a vague indication that one should repeat syllables just sung; rarely are no characters at all assigned. 
<BR>(<A HREF="#r8">Return</A>)

<P><A  NAME="rhpfn"><A NAME="f9"><B>9.</B></A> 
<B>Inconsistencies within right hand strokes</B> 
<BR>These are mainly with the symbols that represent multiple notes, such as a 滾拂 <I>gunfu</I>. A <I>gunfu</I> consisted of a 
<A HREF="../02qnpu/05tydq/ty3.htm#tu3"><I>gun</I></A> downward over several strings, usually all the way to the 1st, then a 
<A HREF="../02qnpu/05tydq/ty3.htm#tu3"><I>fu</I></A> from the 1st or 2nd string back up to the original string. The most common <I>gunfu</I> began at the 7th string, so it would consist of a total of 13 or 14 notes played in rapid succession. These were often paired inconsistently. For example, they might be assigned just one character for the whole <I>gunfu</I>, two characters (one for <I>gun</I> and one for <I>fu</I>), but sometimes it was three, four or even more. There are somes <I>gun</I>s to which seven characters are applied (here usually the tablature usually, instead of "<I>gun</I> 7 to 1", says "<I>gun</I> 7 6 5 4 3 2 1). In my opinion this usually suggests that someone was taking a purely instrumental melody and applying lyrics.

<B>Inconsistences in repeats</B>
<BR>A major characteristic of many <I>qin</I> songs is not only that when there is the instruction "repeat" (再作 <I>zai zuo</I>) there is no indication of whether the lyrics should be repeated, in many cases there are no instructions saying where the repeat begins. In the absence of specific commentary on this, one can only speculate as to whether this suggested flexibility within the <I>qin</I> song idiom, or siply confusion on the part of the transcriber.

In tablature for the period I have studied, i.e., until the end of Ming dynasty, left hand plucks generally are assigned characters but slides generally are not. However, both of the two surviving examples from before the Song dynasty, <A HREF="../02qnpu/02gy.htm"><I>Gu Yuan</I></A> and 
<A HREF="../02qnpu/03slgj.htm#kzhyy"><I>Huang Ying Yin</I></A> are syllabic settings, with the former adding characters to slides, and the latter having no slides.

<B>Criticism of one character per stroke pairing</B>
<BR>Perhaps the most notable Ming dynasty criticism of this method for pairing lyrics to music was that by Yan Cheng, discussed in QSCM, <A HREF="../09hist/qscb/qscb07a2.htm#yanchengpref">Chapter 7a2</A>). In spite of such criticism, though, I have not yet found a handbook that pairs multiple stroke techniques to each syllable, or any other specific evidence that it ever happened (though I am sure it must have at least been tried). The closest I can find to an exceptions are some melodies in <A HREF="../02qnpu/16xltq.htm"><I>Xilutang Qintong</I></A>. This handbook uses the same pairing method, but for a number of melodies it has lyrics with only one or two sections of a longer melody.

<B>Melodies that can be used for specific poetic meters</B>
<BR>Although I have as yet found only this one example, it is enough to suggest it also happened elsewhere.

<B>Finding poems that use specific <I>ci</I> patterns</B>
<BR>The most convenient way I have found so far of finding other poems that use these <I>ci</I> forms is to go the to McGill/Harvard-Yenching Ming Qing Women's Writings website - I don't know of a comparable site for all writings that include male writers. To do the search, go to the <A HREF="http://digital.library.mcgill.ca/mingqing/search/index_eng.php">search page</A>, then under Section II "Browse a List" select "Poem Title" and then type in the <I>ci</I> pattern name, e.g., feng ru song (quotation marks are not necessary and it does not seem to be case sensitive, but it seems to be important that each syllable be written as a separate word.
