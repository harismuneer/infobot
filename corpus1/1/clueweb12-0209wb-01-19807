            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If the first &ldquo;National Treasure&rdquo; was better than it probably deserved to be, then the sequel is worse than it has any right to be.&nbsp; Where the 2004 original was a fresh, fun and exciting Indiana Jones-style adventure that beat &ldquo;The Da Vinci Code&rdquo; to the cinematic punch by almost 2 years, &ldquo;Book of Secrets&rdquo; feels like just another stale, lazy, uninspired sequel.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s something of a disappointment, since it was produced, written and directed by many of the same players that made the first film a surprise hit that grossed $347 million worldwide.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When a mysterious stranger (Ed Harris) shows up with alarming proof that an ancestor of self-proclaimed &ldquo;treasure protector&rdquo; Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) was a co-conspirator in the Lincoln assassination, Ben sets off on a worldwide quest to clear his name.&nbsp; Joining him once again are his estranged ex-girlfriend (Diane Kruger) and his cyber-savvy sidekick (Justin Bartha), but when their search leads to the discovery of the most highly-guarded book on earth, Ben&rsquo;s quest to restore his family&rsquo;s heritage turns into the most dangerous adventure of his life.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As with most blockbusters produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, &ldquo;National Treasure: Book of Secrets&rdquo; is bound to be more of a hit with moviegoers than it will be with critics.&nbsp; And as long as the action keeps things moving, it&rsquo;s certainly entertaining enough.&nbsp; But if you&rsquo;re going to compare apples to apples, then the sequel comes up short.&nbsp; The script is weak, the suspense is gone and the clues are solved too easily to instill a sense of wonder.&nbsp; And after stealing his scenes in the first film, the nerdy partner played by Justin Bartha just isn&rsquo;t as funny this time around.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">But the bigger problem is that the villain, played by Ed Harris, isn&rsquo;t enough of a threat.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s not as menacing as the first film&rsquo;s Ian Howe (played by Sean Bean) &ndash; a worthy opponent to Ben Gates, since they both knew the same tricks and had to constantly outwit each other.&nbsp; Adding double jeopardy to the mix was the FBI agent played by Harvey Keitel, who was right behind both of them every step of the way.&nbsp; In &ldquo;Book of Secrets,&rdquo; he&rsquo;s less of a threat, since he doesn&rsquo;t even get out of the office until more than halfway through the movie.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nicolas Cage is committed as always, but with little time for romance, Diane Kruger doesn&rsquo;t have as much to do this time around.&nbsp; Jon Voight seems happy just to be along for the ride as Cage&rsquo;s father, while Helen Mirren &ndash; a recent Oscar-winner for &ldquo;The Queen&rdquo; &ndash; seems to be having a grand old time as Cage&rsquo;s mother.&nbsp; Bruce Greenwood makes the most of an otherwise absurd scene in which his President of the United States is kidnapped, but it&rsquo;s worth noting, since he played a President before &ndash; John F. Kennedy &ndash; in 2000&rsquo;s &ldquo;Thirteen Days.&rdquo;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">&ldquo;Book of Secrets&rdquo; goes with the assumption that moviegoers will have already seen the original film, since character development is practically non-existent.&nbsp; And that familiarity is fine to an extent, but if the characters don&rsquo;t continue to grow &ndash; or, at least, change in some kind of notable way &ndash; then it&rsquo;s hard to get vested in their best interests.&nbsp; The first film may have been inspired, but the sequel feels tired, and as a result, this &ldquo;National Treasure&rdquo; comes up a dollar short.</font></p></td>
