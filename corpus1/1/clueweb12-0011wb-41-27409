  Cage has always eluded typecasting. Whenever people think they have him pigeonholed, 
  he does something different. For the first ten years of his career, he specialized 
  in weirdos and oddball romantic leads in films like <i>Valley Girl, Raising 
  Arizona</i>, and even the Academy-beloved <i>Moonstruck</i>. Then, after David 
  Lynch's <i>Wild at Heart</i> he began to branch out, playing more straightforward 
  characters in traditional comedies like <i>It Could Happen to You</i> and <i>Guarding 
  Tess</i>. He also started making edgy neo-noirs, sometimes playing the good 
  guy (<i>Red Rock West</i>) and sometimes the bad guy (<i>Kiss of Death</i>). 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Yet, after winning Best Actor for <i>Leaving Las 
  Vegas</i> for a profound if somewhat over-the-top performance as a dying alcoholic, 
  he suddenly decided he was an action star, with John Woo's <i>Face/Off</i> and 
  Bruckheimer-produced craptaculars <i>Con Air</i> and <a href="../../movies/g/gonein60seconds.htm">Gone 
  in Sixty Seconds</a>. At the same time, Cage found time to continue carrying 
  the mantle of romantic lead in <i>City of Angels</i> and <i><a href="../../movies/f/familyman.htm">The 
  Family Man</a></i> and of noir hero in <i>8MM</i>. </font> 
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">Now, Nicolas Cage, né Nicolas Coppola, is a director, 
  like his uncle Francis Ford. For his directorial debut, Cage has chosen a script 
  by made-for-television specialist John Carlen--a script Cage had considered 
  starring in fifteen years ago. But today the thirty-eight-year-old Cage is too 
  long in the tooth to play a young hustler named Sonny, so he recruited James 
  Franco, who first came to national attention in Showtime's <i>James Dean</i>, 
  earning him high profile supporting roles in <i><a href="../../movies/s/sonny.htm">Spider-Man</a></i> 
  and <i>City by the Sea</i>. Mena Suvari, Brenda Blethyn, and Harry Dean Stanton 
  complete the principal cast.</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1">In December 2002, Cage chatted with reporters 
  in Beverly Hills about his new film, <i>Sonny</i>.</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> What did you like about directing, 
  and what did you hate about it? </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Cage:</b> I don't think I hated anything about 
  it, to be honest with you. I was very adrenalized by the experience. I was excited 
  to be surrounded by so many creative people in all walks of the filmmaking process. 
  There is just so much talent in art direction, and camerawork, and certainly 
  the actors, that I liked the idea of being re-ignited myself as an actor by 
  being able to work with such great performers, and being re-stimulated. Also 
  I liked the editing process very much--being in the room and trying to work 
  this puzzle, and get it down to a time that seemed to be the exact correct time 
  for the film, which is a long process. It was different for me. I've never seen 
  a movie so many times in my life. </font>

      time I decided to do action films, people were telling me, 'You're not that

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> You changed your name not to 
  be related to Francis Ford Coppola, from Coppola to Cage. And now you are directing 
  like your uncle. Do you relate in some way? When you started did you want to 
  become like him? </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Cage:</b> No. I always wanted to be an actor. 
  That was my first love and still is. It's the core of my life in film. Even 
  the movie I made is kind of driven by performance and acting. But, my name still 
  is Nicolas Coppola. I never changed my name legally. [Cage] is my acting name, 
  or my surrealistic name… No, when I made this movie, I just decided to go do 
  it. No one in the family knew about it. </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> Do you feel the same rewards 
  doing the big action movies as the small avant-garde work?</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Cage:</b> I think that they're both different. 
  My direction as a person working in film has been to never get comfortable with 
  anything I was doing. At the time that I decided to do action films, people 
  were telling me, "Well, you can't do it. You're not that type. It's not going 
  to work." And so obviously that made me think, "Well, that's not comfortable. 
  Maybe I should try it. What can I do with it?" So I did that, and I'm glad I 
  did it. I'll probably do it again, and I did other kinds of things that seemed 
  like challenges for me, because I like being on the high wire. I like being 
  at that place where you can either fall or stand. That's where I think you really 
  have a shot at doing something truthful. </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> Is it true that you tried to 
  get <i>Sonny</i> made for ten years? </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Cage:</b> No, it's not. What happened was I 
  read the script over fifteen years ago to star in it, and I couldn't find a 
  director to commit to it, and then it was shelved. I literally forgot about 
  it for over fifteen years, until I decided I wanted to direct a movie, and for 
  some reason a bell rang, and I thought, "Oh yeah, I remember that script, that 
  might be interesting." I optioned it, and I re-read it, and I had the same experience 
  as I had when I first read it. It was emotional for me, and I responded to it 
  instinctively, and wanted to try my hand at it. So, that's what happened. I 
  don't think the movie would ever have been made [otherwise]. It would have stayed 
  there in limbo. </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> What were the difficulties with 
  casting the movie before you finally got your group together? </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Cage:</b> Well, first of all, I really believe 
  that the cast that winds up in the movie is the cast that is meant to be. I 
  got very lucky with getting Brenda Blethyn, and--everybody, James Franco, Mena 
  [Suvari], and Harry Dean [Stanton], I think they're all the people that were 
  meant to be in the film. But, without mentioning names, we looked at other possibilities, 
  other actors and actresses, and one thing led to another, and maybe because 
  I was a first-time director, it didn't seem like a safe bet or something, but 
  I'm happy it worked out the way it did. I can't see anyone else playing these 
  parts. </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> Can you talk about Brenda Blethyn? 
  She had to get to a point where she's almost hysterical, very edgy, and yet 
  had to have a certain grounding in reality to make us care for her. You took 
  her to an extreme. Can you talk about that? Because that's something you do 
  in your own work, you take your characters out to that edge, but if they're 
  not real, we're out of the film. </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Cage:</b> I don't know why it is, but I do 
  like dancing in the extreme situations. I like that noise, I like that intensity. 
  For some reason, it's what I respond to in terms of my taste and of my instincts. 
  Brenda is an actress with an enormous range, and an ability to be in some cases 
  larger than life. She had a daredevil sensibility about her that I wanted to 
  access, and guide her to, because that was what I had always been a fan of in 
  her work, that she wasn't afraid to go to those places. She wasn't afraid of 
  the extreme situation or the extreme behavior. That's why I cast her. </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> What qualities did you see in 
  James Franco when you auditioned him? </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Cage:</b> I saw enthusiasm; I saw passion; 
  I saw a dynamic, highly powered intensity. I saw somebody that could be vulnerable, 
  that I could care about, with a face that I could read a story on, and somebody 
  who could be unpredictable and dangerous. </font>

<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> How do you make your actors comfortable 
  when they have to do long scenes in the nude?</font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Cage:</b> I think a lot of it is coming from 
  a place of respect, and knowing that I also am an actor, and knowing how vulnerable 
  it is to bare your soul. I wanted them to feel safe, and let them know that 
  I wanted the set to have quiet so they could concentrate and go to whatever 
  place they needed to in their instrument. I trusted their instincts, and I trusted 
  them to bring to the scene whatever it was that they instinctively felt. Afterwards, 
  we would experiment together, and try different things, sculpt a little bit. 
  We wanted this movie to be as truthful as we could, and not really pull any 
  punches. I think that was important too, in terms of the nudity, that this is 
  a way of making the film more real, and more intimate, rather than trying to 
  hide away from it. </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> The larger issue besides what 
  happens to Sonny is what happens to all of us when we get trapped into a way 
  of being--how it seems to us our only life, our only choice. How did you work 
  to portray that? </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Cage:</b> I can't stress enough how much of 
  it came down to instinct, and what felt right… The scene in the bathroom when 
  he's saying, "I'm better than you," what he's really saying is, "I'm not." I 
  guess I connected with that sense of loneliness. That feeling of being outside 
  and not belonging is something I think we all can relate to. We've all had feelings 
  like that, of wanting to belong somewhere and being unable to do it. But it's 
  hard to talk about because I don't want to rob anybody of their own interpretation. 
  </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> How do you feel having <i>Sonny</i> 
  in movie theaters at the same time as <i>Adaptation</i>? </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Cage:</b> Well, I think because in one I'm 
  an actor and in the other I'm a director, it actually is kind of exciting to 
  have different points of expression come out at the same time. I'm not really 
  worried about that. </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> In <i>Adaptation</i>, how was 
  it to act with yourself? </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Cage:</b> It was… challenging. </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> How weird was it to watch the 
  movie? </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Cage:</b> When I watched the movie, I was able 
  to separate myself from it enough that I could get lost in the movie, which 
  is unusual. I didn't really see me up there, I kind of saw these other people 
  that were brothers. </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> How do you respond when your 
  personal life becomes news? </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Cage:</b> I'd rather not talk about it. </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> Has your acting changed since 
  directing? </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Cage:</b> Yeah, I think it has. I don't know 
  exactly how, but I was so taken with watching Harry Dean Stanton and the simplicity 
  of his reality. It made me… as I said, re-stimulated, or re-ignited. I look 
  at wanting to dig a little deeper with my own work, and getting inspired again, 
  and more passionate. I think directing definitely helped my acting. </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Question:</b> Will you change your approach 
  with other directors now? </font>
<p><font face="Arial" size="-1"><b>Cage:</b> I don't think so. I certainly would 
  never overstep my bounds and make suggestions to a director. As an actor I'm 
  trying to fit to the best of my abilities within the director's vision, and 
  trying to find some happy rapport where we can both bring something to it that's 
  fresh. Usually I've been lucky in working with directors who have trusted my 
  instincts. I had a great experience working with Ridley Scott recently [on the 
  upcoming <i>Matchstick Men</i>]. He was very encouraging to go find something, 
  and I did. But no, when I'm acting, I'm strictly going to be acting. </font>
