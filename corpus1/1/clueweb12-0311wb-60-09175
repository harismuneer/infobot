<p>As our site URL says, it takes &#8220;270 to Win&#8221;. If neither candidate gets a majority of the Electoral Votes,    the election for President is decided in the House of Representatives, with each state delegation having    one vote.  Senators would elect the Vice-President.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a what-ifscenario that I just ran on the election, if it were held today (9/22/08):</p>
<p>Pres:  Barack Obama<br />
VP:   Sarah Palin</p>
<p>Say what???  I&#8217;m insane, right?  Well, follow along&#8230;</p>
<p>1) I took the current default map from <a href="http://www.270towin.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.270towin.com</a> which plots expected outcomes in states where polls are convincing enough to predict a winner.  That leaves 13 states undecided.</p>
<p>2) I plug in all of the light red/blue conclusions from the USA Today poll tracker at <a href="http://tiny.pl/8kmm" rel="nofollow">http://tiny.pl/8kmm</a> .  That leaves 4 states undecided (NV, CO, PA, NH.)</p>
<p>3) I take the most recent poll data from those four states (in the case of an exact tie, I take the one previous) as reported by USA Today.  The polls show NV: McCain (49-46), CO: Obama (51-41), PA: Obama (49-44), and NH: McCain (48-45)  Now, I plug these four results into the interactive map at 270towin, and I get&#8230;</p>
<p>*gasp*</p>
<p>Obama: 269; McCain: 269&#8230; A DEAD TIE!!!</p>
<p>Now, I had to look up what happens in the case of a tie: 270towin says: &#8220;If neither candidate has reached 270 Electoral Votes, then the House and Senate take over and elect the President and Vice-President, respectively.&#8221;</p>
<p>4) So, let&#8217;s go to the House of Representatives to determine the president.  Assuming straight party lines, the House is controlled by the Dems, so OBAMA IS &#8220;ELECTED&#8221; PRESIDENT by the House</p>
<p>5) Let&#8217;s turn to the Senate to determine the VP:  49 Reps, 49 Dems, 2 Independents.  Again, going with straight party line, the score is 49-49.  Now, we know that Lieberman will vote for McCain, so give John a one vote advantage, but even if Bernard Sanders votes for Obama, you now have a 50-50 tie&#8230; bring in Dick Cheney to break the tie, he&#8217;ll go party line for sure, and PALIN IS &#8220;ELECTED&#8221; VICE PRESIDENT by the senate.</p>
<p>There are still some &#8220;ifs&#8221; in there, like&#8230; the house and senate must stay at their current levels&#8230; for the senate, that&#8217;s a big &#8220;if.&#8221;</p>

<p>You may be right about many resources to support the cities coming from the rural areas but when it comes to government most of the tax money comes from the cities and gets spent in the rural areas so I think things generally balance out.</p>

<p>So basically McCain just needs to win it straight up for our contry to even stand a chance. With all of these companies going bottom up I can only imagine how many more will go bottom up when Obama raises thier taxes. Especially in Michigan where I live, we are already loosing jobs left and right because the current legislative branch cant figure out that they need to eliminate taxes for these companies completely. And then Obama will raise them and bye bye Chevrolet, bye bye Ford, bye bye Chrysler, bye bye hundreds of thousands of American jobs.</p>
<p>And why can either party figure out that we need to close the freaken boarders and keep all illegals out and close down imigration for a while. Get some money back to the people. Obamas crap tax breaks for the middle class are a joke. According to his tax breaks, I would get about an extra $100 dollars a year! WHOO HOO, that is really somthing special, Thanks Obama I can now buy 2 blue ray DVD&#8217;s, or I might even be able to get a Walmart Huffy bike for my son. Even though it will break in 2 years, and it will support those companies that are building them overseas. </p>
<p>Or, if McCain gets in, my boss will continue the 50 cent a year raise that is promissed to us only if McCain is elected. By my calculations&#8230; $750 extra next year if McCain is elected. </p>
<p>Sorry Obama, you need to move to a Socialist nation if that is what you really want, dont come in here and try to please all of your rich Fanny and Freddy friends while destorying life for the middle class. You are nothing but an impostor that can convince people to jump off a bridge just because you can speak well.</p>

<p>According to the rules,Only   &#8216;One &#8216; Congressman from each state gets to vote,and since there are more red states,that favors McCain,and they only get to vote for the top 3 E. C. getters for President.</p>
<p>The senate only votes for Vice President,and again, only one vote per state,and only the top two E.C. vote getters&#8230;We very well could see McCain get elected by the House and Biden by the Senate.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve yet to find out who chooses the voter from each State,if it&#8217;s Congress McCain is toast,but if it&#8217;s Majority  of R/D Reps from each state..McCain should win easily.</p>

<p>Democrats will or should control most congressional delegations should that come up and it is the delegation as a whole that casts the vote based on the individual members and they could be pressured to not vote party lines by their constituents.</p>
<p>The Senate vote is by individuals not by state.  I don&#8217;t see Lieberman voting for Palin and the Democrats should definately pick up more seats there so Biden should win that easily.</p>

<p>Yeah.but I&#8217;m just saying there are more Red states,and McCain would have a chance to pull 26 votes(All he needs) even if the Democrats are in the Majority,unless the Cop Out Popular vote comes into play,but we all know that doesn&#8217;t mean crap because you don&#8217;t see McCain out panning for extra votes in NY/CA states he will lose.</p>

<p>If you read the earlier posts you will learn why it is so unlikely for Palin to win in the Senate.  In addition, I could even see some Republican senators voting for Biden due to the experience/judgement factor and the fact that he is one of them so they probably would feel they could work with him better.</p>

<p>There’s one other interesting thing about the tie scenario to point out that I haven&#8217;t seen mentioned on these posts-</p>
<p>In the tie scenario, Biden would essentially be voting for himself for VP. According to what I&#8217;ve read, his state allows him to simultaneously run for VP and the Senate, so if he wins that Senate election and there was an electoral college tie, my guess is he would be sworn in to the new session of Congress, and vote for himself for VP as his only act of that Congressional session. Of course others casting notable votes in that would be none other than McCain and Obama as well.</p>
<p>One other thought- it seems that having an odd number of total electoral college votes available would avoid the whole tie-breaking mess, assuming that we continue in our 2 party system and forgoing the possibility of faithless electors. Though of course that would ruin some of the &#8220;fun&#8221; I guess&#8230;</p>

<p>The Electorial College numbers for each state are equal to the House+Senate members of each state,so depending on redistricting or Census the total could very well change,but they cant very well just make it odd for the heck of it.</p>
<p>I also heard on Fox News yesterday that although there is confusion,the vote can be immediate,but McCain is behind in delegation numbers 27-21-2,so unless they honor the voters of there state(McCain is sure to win more States),McCain cant win a house vote,and any new Congress would surely have worse numbers for McCain.</p>

<p>Interesting thought on the number of electors.  There would have to be another seat added to the House of Representatives to make it work but then there would be an even number of voting members of the House.  The best solution is along the lines of the current DC voting rights act being considered.  It would give the next state in line to gain a representative based on the census that representative (currently would be Republican) in return for giving DC&#8217;s non-voting delegate (currently and for the foreseable future a Democrat)  full voting rights.  This doesn&#8217;t correct the fact that the delegate couldn&#8217;t constitutionally vote when the House decides presidential elections and DC would still be unrepresented in the Senate.  Also the current bill would have the new non-DC seat disappear after the next census and redistricting.</p>
<p>In addition, having an odd number of electors doesn&#8217;t change the fact that the winner still needs an absolute majority.  So one elector intentionally or unintentionally not voting for their candidate, not voting, or being unable to vote could theoretically throw the election to the House if things are close enough.  Also if three or more different people win electors then all of them could be short of the necessary majority.</p>

<p>The current House would decide, right? Not the newly elected one? I guess it doesn’t matter too much, though, since democrats are in control now and look to be gaining even more seats in November. Barring a faithless elector, it looks like Mccain needs 270, but Obama only needs 269.<br />

It&#8217;s probably good for Obama the new House and Senate would decide. The Senate picks VP and right now they have an advantage of one, Joe Lieberman! The man they said is out after this election! If he voted for Palin it would be a 50/50 tie. Of coarse, it&#8217;s the NEW Senate, not this one! I don&#8217;t understand giving the Senate more Democrats, however. They have a lower approval rating than Bush! As an Independent I don&#8217;t understand wanting to throw out all Republicans and give more Senate seats to a Party less popular than Bush when it comes to that! It is so strange! Still, that seems to be what Americans want to do, and will most likely do. Regardless, of how much or how little sense it makes! Imagine Republicans win the Senate, they could name Palin as Obama&#8217;s VP. Now, that&#8217;s bipartisan! lol  <img src='http://www.270towin.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>

<p>The Popular vote by itself would be fine with me,but the rules are Electoral College,for instance..McCain will not spend any money in CA/NY because he&#8217;s going to lose those states,but if  it was the popular vote he would spend,so You&#8217;re an idiot if you run around like Gore did in 2000 claiming some sort victory,when the smart guy spends his money in states he has a chance to win.</p>
<p>Also,Military and provisional ballots were not counted in in at least two states in 2000 CA/MI only because they would not mattered in the overall outcome of the state,Bush clearly would have won those 2-1..That happens all the time,some votes are just are not counted,so popular vote is fine with me if changed,but as long as it&#8217;s Electoral College and those are the rules right now&#8230;Popular vote will not mean a lick of sh&#8217;t to me this go around.</p>
<p>I do feel because McCain will not spend in NY/CA,Obama could very well win the Popular vote and lose the Election just like 2000,but if it&#8217;s a tie and they start on that Popular vote crap to claim why they should win&#8230;THATS GOING TO BE A JOKE,EVEN IF HE WOULD WIN A HOUSE VOTE ANYWAY.</p>

<p>Any attempt to claim Democrats as a whole are more unpopular than the president based on congressional approval ratings is flawed.  The unpopularity of the Congress has to do with the institution as a whole: Republicans, Democrats, how the system is set up, and how those three factors interplay.  Part of the unpopularity is people who would otherwise be supportive of Democrats alone being frustrated by the Republicans actions and vice versa.</p>

<p>Well after the first debate Obama got a boost and no president has had the galup poll (created since 1960 election) lead after the first debate has ever lost. So I guess we&#8217;ll take history&#8217;s lesson and just assume Obama wins. But God allows a 269-269 tie then the E.C. is on the rocks and our Democracy has some real questions to answer. Does anyone have any ideas of alternatives to the E.C. and suggestions to what will happen to it if there is a tie?</p>

<p>To everyone who suggests we should just rely on popular vote as the tie-breaker when an insufficient number of EC votes have been obtained &#8211; you are taking an extremely short-sighted view of the electoral process.  The rules for elections are meant to consider not only our present situation, but future potential scenarios.  Envision a change in our political climate such that we no longer have 2 party system.  If there are 3 or 4 major competing parties, you could conceivably have an individual get elected with 25.1-33.4% of the popular vote&#8230; hardly a mandate.  The electoral process is designed to yield a valid compromise in the event that the general public cannot decide on a clear-cut winner.  While it&#8217;s not perfect, it&#8217;s still a very good system.</p>

<p>Here is a fun exercise:</p>
<p>Take the map as is (with polling data).  Then go through and take any undecided state that voted two times in a row for Clinton in &#8217;92 &amp; &#8217;96 and put it in the Dem column (sounds reasonable, right?).  </p>
<p>Take any undecided state that does not fit the above criteria and put it in whatever column the state voted for most in the last ten election (this will usually be Republican).</p>
<p>This ends up with Florida and Ohio going Red.  For example, calling states like Indiana a &#8216;swing&#8221; state is kind of a joke.  It hasn&#8217;t voted Democratic in the last ten elections.  I think we can safely put that in the Red column.</p>
<p>After all those adjustments are done, you end up with with a 169-169 tie.</p>
<p>Go figure. <img src='http://www.270towin.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>
<p>The final map looks like this:</p>
<p>Blue States (Democrat):<br />
WA, OR, CA, NM, HI, MN, IA, WI, IL, MI, WV, PA, NY, VT, NH, ME, MA, CT, RI, DC</p>
<p>Red States (Republican):<br />

<p>Everybody needs to remember that if it gets to the House it would be 1 state, 1 vote, meaning you would have a race to 26.  Each state delegation would have to determine for themselves whom they wanted to vote for.  Needless to say this method would have a lot of wheeling and dealing.</p>

<p>So, your comment is that &#8220;This might bring the electoral college system to its knees.&#8221;</p>
<p>What a STUPID comment.  We have this little document called the CONSTITUTION.  This is the way its supposed to work!</p>
<p>People have to remember this is not a national referendum vote for President and Vice President from one big monolithic federal election. States elect POTUS and VPOTUS through Electors that are the best mechanism to equalize representation and respect the independent voice of each state in the Union.  Electors in most cases are not bound by law to cast the actual vote for President and VP based on the popular vote.  </p>
<p>What &#8211; you suggest we tweak the Constitution for &#8220;little things&#8221; like voting process?  </p>
<p>Those are the rules as ratified in the Constitution and you&#8217;re comment is irresponsible.</p>
<p><strong>270toWin:</strong>  We run an electoral college website; it isn&#8217;t in our interest to bash that process and that wasn&#8217;t the point of the comment.  In fact, we made the exact point you make in an article in the Wall Street Journal last Friday, where we indicated that the electoral college approach made sense because we are the United <em><strong>States</strong></em> of America.    The point was that the 2000 election was controversial because the popular vote winner was not the electoral college winner.  A similar, or even greater controversy could happen if there was a tie.   Controversial in both cases because to the vast majority of people this would be something with which they are unfamiliar.  Just because something is the way it is supposed to be doesn&#8217;t preclude it being controversial.</p>

<p>Expect some behind the scenes promises &#8212; since individuals (the one guy from N Dak or S Dak or Alaska or other small states) have far greater power than normal, it is plausible that a deal is cut with one or more of them.  An offer of a cabinet position to a guy who might otherwise spend his career as the congressman from some small state.  A promise of funding some project&#8230;  a job for the congresswoman&#8217;s husband&#8230; you name it.  If there is a tie, it should come down to the party by party breakdown of each state&#8217;s delegation in the house&#8230; but this not what will happen.  A few side deals will be cut and the perpetrators will find a lame excuse (my state voted for this guy&#8230; or the national count was higher for this guy&#8230; or my district went with this guy&#8230; or I trust this guy better&#8230; ).  It is no sure thing that party or state discipline will win the day.</p>

<p>Being that the number of electors is the total of the house membership, 435,  plus the total senate membership, 100, there should be 535 electors. Being that 535 is an odd number, we wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about a tie. However, with the 23rd amendment giving 3 electors to Washington, DC we now have 538 electors, an even number. Fact is that the 23rd amendment was a poor attempt to solve one problem, in turn creating another. Maybe we could give 3 electoral votes to Puerto Rico.</p>

<p>From reading the posts, I fear there is a lot of misundersanding of the applicable election provisions of the constitution. Here are the facts, which can be checked be reference to Art. III and the 12th Amendment:</p>
<p>1. First, it is not at all clear from the 12th Amendment that it would be the incoming Congress that would select the president in the case of a tie in the Electoral College. Indeed, the language of the 12th Amendment suggests the exact OPPOSITE, stating that the House shall &#8220;immediately&#8221; choose the President upon tallying a tie in the Electoral College. Interpreting the word &#8220;immediately&#8221; severall months later (i.e. sometime in January after the incoming House has been sworn in), is, if anything, a rather far-fetched reading of the words of the 12th Amendment.</p>
<p>2. According to the only precedent we have for a conginent House election (the House election of 1824), each delegation shall have an internal vote to determine how each state shall vote. If the vote is tied within a state&#8217;s delegation, that state loses its one vote.</p>
<p><strong>270toWin:</strong>   The tally in the House doesn&#8217;t take place until 1/6/09, after the new Congress is inaugurated.   The House would immediately move to choose a President after that.</p>

<p>You want an idea that could fix the college system. In the event of no one reaching a plurality and the first ballots are not broken in the house for president. Take the college vote and and have it proportionally divide 2/3 of the total electoral college up between the top two candidates. Take the popular vote and have it divide the other 1/3 of the vote up according to the top two candidates.Either way you end up with someone who is most likely to balanced and a universally likeable candidate. Incorporating both the  state by state basis and the nation as a whole. While downplaying the population advantages of california, and other more populous states.</p>

<p>Correction no one reaching a majority, and not having been decided on the first ballot. </p>
<p>And it&#8217;s a all in one method, not &#8220;either way&#8221; as i said.</p>

<p>In regards to the concern about House of Representatives not being able to give at least 26 states to one candidate or the other, they would hold revotes until a winner emerged.</p>

<p>In the event of an electoral tie, certain types of &#8220;faithless electors&#8221; would be unlikely &#8211; an elector wouldn&#8217;t want to accidentally flip the Presidency to somebody else.  But they might decide to add another candidate for the Presidency into the House vote.<br />
I think the most likely &#8220;faithless elector&#8221; scenarios would be for both Hillary Clinton and Sarah Palin to receive one or more electoral votes.  Hillary could receive votes from Democratic electors who thought she deserved the nomination, and Sarah could receive votes from far-right electors who think McCain is too moderate.  If that happened, whichever of them received more faithless elector votes would be eligible for votes by state delegations in the House.  It&#8217;s conceivable that Sarah Palin could be elected both President and Vice President.  It&#8217;s much more likely that Obama and Biden would be elected, and it&#8217;s somewhat likely that McCain and Biden would be elected.</p>
