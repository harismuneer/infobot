                    of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 
                    was to jump-start the economy and generate investment in the 
                    stock of American companies. As a result, the 2003 Tax Act 
                    included changes in dividend tax rates and capital gains rates 
                    applicable to individuals as taxpayers. The changes require 
                    both individuals and corporations to consider new tax planning

                      gains arise from the sale of capital assets, such as stocks, 
                      bonds, and land, at a price higher than the asset&#8217;s 
                      cost or basis. If a capital asset has been held longer than 
                      one year, the gain is considered a long-term capital gain. 
                      If the capital asset has been held for a year or less, the 
                      gain is considered a short-term capital gain. Short-term 
                      capital gains are taxed at the taxpayer&#8217;s regular 
                      tax rates. Before the 2003 Tax Act, long-term capital gains 
                      were taxed at 20% for taxpayers in the 25% or higher tax 
                      bracket (10% for individuals in the 10% and 15% marginal 
                      tax brackets).</font></p>

                      after December 31, 2000. These gains were taxed at a maximum 
                      rate of 18% (8% for individuals in the 10% and 15% marginal 
                      tax brackets). Individuals in a tax bracket higher than 
                      15% had the opportunity to make a special &#8220;deemed 
                      sale election&#8221; on their 2001 tax returns, which allowed 
                      them to pay the applicable capital gains tax on the asset 
                      as though it was sold on January 1, 2001, and then begin 
                      the holding period anew on that date. This was to be an 
                      irrevocable election.</font></p>

                      2003 Tax Act&#8217;s provisions lowered the rates on long-term 
                      capital gains to 15% for taxpayers in the 25% bracket or 
                      higher and lowered the 10% rate to 5% for individuals in 
                      the 10% and 15% tax brackets, effective May 6, 2003, through 
                      December 31, 2008. This provision eliminated the five-year 
                      holding period rates of 18% and 8%. In 2008, the new 15% 
                      rate remains the same but the 5% rate drops to 0%. In 2009, 
                      the capital gain rates will return to the old 20% and 10% 
                      rates, and the five-year holding period rules and rates 
                      return. The act did not change the capital gain rates for 
                      collectibles (28%) and unrecaptured section 1250 gains (25%). 
                      The new capital gain tax rates apply to both the regular 
                      tax and the alternative minimum tax (AMT) calculations.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><em><strong>Economic 
                      effects.</strong></em> Past capital gain tax rate cuts have 
                      increased revenue to the federal government in the first 
                      two calendar years after the cuts, yet lost revenue thereafter. 
                      Some observers speculate that the increase in revenue arises 
                      from the unlocking effect of taxpayers who wished to sell 
                      their assets and invest in an alternative financial vehicle 
                      that might yield a greater return. The responsiveness to 
                      lower capital gain tax rates declines as taxpayers&#8217; 
                      marginal tax rates decline. In addition, according to <em>Congressional 
                      Research Service Report of Congress&#8212;Economic and Revenue 
                      Effects of Permanent and Temporary Capital Gains Tax Cuts, 
                      Updated January 29, 2003</em> (issued February 26, 2003), 
                      the amount of tax revenue decreases as the capital gains 
                      are taxed at lower rates. Finally, a capital gains tax cut 
                      induces stock sales, which causes downward pressure on stock 
                      prices in the market.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One 
                      reason Congress gave for reducing the capital gain tax rates 
                      was to stimulate consumer spending. The House Ways and Means 
                      Committee noted, however, that savings from the capital 
                      gains tax cut would be concentrated among higher-income 
                      individuals, and as a result the savings were less likely 
                      to be spent and would produce only a small economic stimulus.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">According 
                      to the <em>House Ways and Means Committee Report on Jobs 
                      and Growth Reconciliation Tax Act of 2003, HR2</em> (issued 
                      May 16, 2003), &#8220;In tax year 2003, the capital-gains 
                      tax cut which only covers eight months of the year is worth 
                      $30,700 to millionaires, but only $42 to households with 
                      incomes between $40,000 and $50,000. Sixty-one percent of 
                      the benefits from the capital-gains dividend tax cut go 
                      to only 2% of households with incomes over $200,000. IRS 
                      data for 2000 show that those with incomes over $500,000 
                      accounted for 57% of all capital gains and dividends, but 
                      comprised only 0.5% of taxpayers and accounted for only 
                      17% of income from all sources.&#8221;</font></p>

                      contrast, according to the aforementioned <em>Congressional 
                      Research Report</em>, the capital gains tax accounts for 
                      less than 1% of income taxes for the bottom 70% of taxpayers.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Because 
                      the 2003 act&#8217;s capital gain rate reductions are temporary, 
                      they may raise revenue initially but lose a larger amount 
                      of revenue in the long run. By appropriately timing the 
                      sale of capital gain assets, a taxpayer is able to choose 
                      among different tax rates and rates of return. </font><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">According 
                      to a 2003 report by the Congressional Research Service, 
                      a similar event occurred as a result of the 1986 Tax Act. 
                      When capital gain tax rates rose from 20% to 28%, there 
                      was a rise in capital gains taxes collected, from 4.22% 
                      of GDP in 1985 to 7.6% in 1986 (before the rate increase 
                      was effective); it then fell to 3.2% of GDP in 1987.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"><em><strong>Effects 
                      on individual taxpayers.</strong></em> The lower capital 
                      gain tax rates enacted by the 2003 Tax Act effectively eliminated 
                      the five-year holding period election until 2009. Taxpayers 
                      that previously made this election and recognized some capital 
                      gain on their 2001 tax returns might consider filing an 
                      amended 2001 return if Congress permits revocation of the 
                      deemed sale election in subsequent legislation.</font></p>

                      additional problem arises for a taxpayer who sells assets 
                      that are being held long term in order to take advantage 
                      of the five-year holding period rules. If these assets are 
                      sold in order to take advantage of the current lower rates, 
                      the replacement assets must be held another five years in 
                      order to take advantage of the special five-year rates in 
                      the future. The taxpayer must also be sure the like-kind 
                      exchange rules do not apply to the transactions.</font></p>

                      members without incurring a gift tax. The new capital gain 
                      tax rates thus present a good tax planning opportunity. 
                      Taxpayers can gift appreciated capital assets to children 
                      over age 13 (to avoid &#8220;kiddie tax&#8221; rules). The 
                      children could then sell the assets now and pay a 5% capital 
                      gain tax rate, or wait until 2008 and pay a 0% capital gain 
                      tax rate (assuming their other income is low enough). The 
                      children can then use the money to fund college expenses 
                      or start a business, or give it back to their parents or

                      negative side effect of the reduction in the capital gain 
                      tax rates may be a reduction in charitable contributions 
                      of appreciated capital assets. Taxpayers may be tempted 
                      to sell appreciated capital assets themselves rather than 
                      contributing those same assets to charity.</font></p>

                      the 2003 Tax Act, dividend income was taxed to individuals 
                      as ordinary income at their regular marginal tax rates. 
                      The act changed the tax rates applicable to dividends in 
                      an indirect manner. First, it increased net capital gains 
                      by qualified dividend income for purposes of applying the 
                      maximum capital gains rate. At the same time, the act reduced 
                      the maximum capital gain tax rates for individuals, as previously 
                      discussed. As a result, it effectively lowered the tax on 
                      individuals receiving qualified dividends to 15% (5% if 
                      they are in the 10% or 15% regular tax bracket). It does 
                      not change the character of dividend income: Dividends are 
                      still considered ordinary income and cannot be offset against 
                      net capital losses.</font></p>

                      and Treasury bonds, and other fixed income securities like 
                      CDs and money-market accounts, may make better investments 
                      for pension plans, IRAs, and other tax-deferred accounts. 
                      Taxpayers will not have to pay taxes on income from these 
                      investments until they receive distributions from the accounts. 
                      Although these investments do not qualify for the reduced 
                      dividend and capital gain tax rates, there are many nontax 
                      reasons for using a retirement account. The appeal of other 
                      tax-deferred investments, such as variable annuities, may 
                      be diminishing, however. Investors may find it cheaper to 
                      pay taxes each year on dividends and capital gains at the 
                      low 15% rate (especially if they are in the top brackets) 
                      rather than defer income but pay ordinary tax rates when 
                      the income is received.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">The 
                      2003 Tax Act provisions equating the tax rate for both dividends 
                      and capital gains may also reduce the importance of tax 
                      planning related to structuring transactions to ensure that 
                      any gain recognized by individual shareholders is classified 
                      as capital gains rather than as dividends. Consider stock 
                      redemptions as an example. If a corporation redeems its 
                      stock, the redemption proceeds are treated as dividend income 
                      to the individual taxpayers unless the redemption can be 
                      treated as an exchange and accorded capital gain treatment 
                      under IRC section 302. Prior to the 2003 Tax Act, individuals 
                      preferred exchange treatment as opposed to dividend treatment, 
                      because capital gains were subject to the beneficial lower 
                      capital gains tax rates while dividends were subject to 
                      ordinary income tax rates. Now, both types of income are 
                      subject to the same tax rates.</font></p>

                      reduction in the dividend tax rate also narrows the tax 
                      difference businesses have to consider when debating between 
                      operating as a C corporation or as a pass-through entity 
                      such as a partnership. Although operating as a C corporation 
                      will still mean a higher tax cost due to double taxation 
                      of income, that gap has narrowed. Other nontax factors may 
                      become more influential in the decision of which entity 
                      to use.</font></p>

                      tax law revisions benefit industry sectors differently. 
                      The reduced dividend tax rate would seem to benefit established 
                      companies, such as manufacturers and banks, which have a 
                      history of paying dividends. Conversely, the technology 
                      sector would not benefit, because such companies typically 
                      reinvest earnings into additional research and development 
                      rather than paying dividends. Microsoft&#8217;s recently 
                      announced dividend policy, however, may mark the start of 
                      a different trend.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">One 
                      last planning consideration would be the frequent practice 
                      of borrowing funds to purchase dividend-paying stocks. Assuming 
                      the interest is deductible as investment interest, this 
                      will generate a tax savings at regular tax rates, while 
                      the resulting dividend income is taxed at the preferential 
                      15% rate. This can create positive after-tax cash flows 
                      for individual investors. The big limitation to this approach 
                      is the investment interest limit. Dividends cannot be considered 
                      investment income and also be subject to the 15% tax rate, 
                      so investors need other sources of investment income in 
                      order to fully deduct the investment interest expense. </font></p>
