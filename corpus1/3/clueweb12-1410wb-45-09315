							Can chocolate do your heart a power of good?	
						</h3>
						
						<br/>
						<div id="articleBody">Chocolate can be good for the heart, reported the Daily Mail (20 July 2005). The newspaper accurately reported the main finding of a well-conducted small, short-term study that showed improvements in blood pressure and related measures in people with hypertension who ate 100 g dark chocolate daily.<br/><br/><UL>
<LI>
<P>Dark chocolate can be good for the heart and lower blood pressure, the <I>Daily Mail</I> reported on 20 July 2005 (1). </P>
<LI>
<P>The report was based on a clinical study involving 20 patients with high blood pressure (hypertension) and 15 healthy controls (2). The study compared the effects of eating dark chocolate with those of white chocolate. Blood pressure fell significantly in both groups after eating 100 g dark chocolate (containing approximately 88 mg flavonols) daily for 15 days, but not after eating flavonol-free white chocolate. Blood cholesterol, insulin resistance (a risk factor for diabetes) and blood vessel function also improved in the patients with hypertension after 15 days of dark chocolate. </P>
<LI>
<P>The newspaper accurately reported the main finding of the well-conducted study, namely that flavonols found in dark chocolate may have some benefits for people with high blood pressure. Although the trial did not provide direct evidence of beneficial effects on the heart, the newspaper statement that dark chocolate may be good for the heart reflects the trial results for effects on blood pressure, blood vessel function and blood cholesterol. </P></LI></UL>
<H4>Evaluation of the evidence base for benefits of dark chocolate in hypertension</H4>
<H5>Where does the evidence come from?</H5>
<P>The research study was conducted by Dr Davide Grassi and colleagues at the University of L'Aquila, Italy, and Tufts University, Boston, USA. </P>
<H5>What were the authors' objectives?</H5>
<P>The authors' objective was to evaluate the effects of flavonols derived from dark chocolate on blood pressure, blood vessel function and response to an oral glucose tolerance test in patients with previously untreated hypertension. </P>
<H5>What was the nature of the evidence?</H5>
<P>This was a randomised controlled trial involving 20 patients with mild hypertension (high blood pressure) and 15 healthy volunteers. All the participants were asked to abstain from cocoa and other flavonoid-rich foods and drinks for 7 days, then were randomly assigned to eat either 100 g dark chocolate or 90 g white chocolate daily for 15 days. After another cocoa-free period of 7 days, participants were switched to the other type of chocolate for 15 days. Blood pressure, oral glucose tolerance, blood vessel function and blood cholesterol levels were evaluated before and after each chocolate eating period. </P>
<H5>What interventions were examined in the research?</H5>
<P>The dark and white chocolate bars used in the study were similar in composition except that the dark chocolate contained approximately 88 mg flavonols per bar and the white chocolate contained none. </P>
<H5>What were the findings?</H5>
<P>Blood pressure decreased significantly after eating dark chocolate in both hypertensive patients and healthy controls. In the patients with hypertension, three measures of insulin resistance/sensitivity (a risk factor for the development of diabetes) were significantly improved by dark chocolate. Blood vessel function was impaired in the hypertensive patients at the start of the study but increased to almost normal levels after 15 days of dark chocolate. Blood cholesterol levels in the hypertensive patients decreased significantly after eating dark chocolate. White chocolate had no significant effect on any of the factors assessed in the trial. </P>
<H5>What were the authors' conclusions?</H5>
<P>The authors concluded that, when eaten as part of a healthy diet, flavonols from cocoa products may provide some benefits on blood pressure and glucose tolerance in patients with hypertension. </P>
<H5>How reliable are the conclusions?</H5>
<P>The authors used an appropriate study design (a randomised controlled trial) to test the hypothesis that flavonols in dark chocolate might benefit people with hypertension. Participants were not prevented from knowing which type of chocolate they were eating, but this is unlikely to have significantly influenced the results because most assessments were based on blood samples or were performed by clinicians who were blinded to the study's design and purpose. The results could have been affected if participants had altered their total calorie intake or physical activity levels, or consumed other sources of flavonols, during the study. However, the authors monitored this using diaries of physical activity and food intake and the participants were instructed to maintain their diet and refrain from flavonoid-rich foods and beverages.</P>
<P>The authors' conclusions are likely to be reliable. However, this was a small and short term trial and further research would be necessary to determine whether the benefits of dark chocolate are maintained in the longer term. Also the hypertensive patients in the trial were otherwise healthy, non-obese individuals who did not smoke or drink alcohol. They are therefore not representative of a more general population of patients with hypertension. Whilst the trial provides a clear indication of effects of flavonols it should be noted that the trial measured the effects of eating dark chocolate in people who had consumed a low flavonol diet for a week before the trial and then did not consume flavonols from foods other than the dark chocolate during the trial. Therefore the trial does not provide information on whether eating dark chocolate as well as a normal flavonol-containing diet (e.g. drinking tea or red wine, eating certain fruits and vegetables) would provide added benefits. Finally, the outcomes measured do not provide direct evidence that chocolate can reduce the risk of developing heart disease or diabetes in patients with hypertension. </P>
<P>Importantly, as the authors point out, the dark chocolate used in this study differs markedly from most commercially available chocolate products, which have a low flavonol content.</P>
<H5>Systematic reviews</H5>
<P>Information staff at CRD searched for systematic reviews relevant to this topic. Systematic reviews are valuable sources of evidence as they locate, appraise and synthesize all available evidence on a particular topic.</P>
<P>There were no related systematic reviews identified on the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR) or on the <A href="http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/crd/crddatabases.htm" target="_blank">Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE)</A>.</P>
