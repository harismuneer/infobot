<H2>Sacred Songs for the Home</H2>
<P align="left">&nbsp;</P>
<P align="left">We've spent over five years now presenting a multitude of Tin 
  Pan Alley's wares for the home parlor piano. We've explored many different themes 
  and styles and presented almost 1,000 secular songs for your enjoyment. This 
  month, we want to look at the sacred side of parlor music and share with you 
  a few of the many inspirational sacred songs from the turn of the 20th century 
  that undoubtedly graced many a home. Though we have presented a few sacred songs 
  in some of our other features (we'll include a list with links on page two of 
  this feature), we really have not explored this aspect of parlor music from 
  the Tin Pan Alley era. 
<P align="left">&nbsp; 
<P align="left">As we pointed out in our essay about the <a href="/insearch/deadzone/insearch.php" target="_blank">earliest 
  American music</a>, most early American music was sacred or liturgical. The 
  settlers brought their hymnals and song books from their homelands to America, 
  and sang praises to their God in thanks for their good fortune. It was only 
  later that America began to develop its own styles and kinds of music beyond 
  the sacred. As such, sacred music and religion has always played an important 
  part in American life. Home and family values were important and often the family 
  would gather 'round the piano in the music parlor to sing praises to God. Sundays 
  in the parlor were often reserved for singing the old favorites and some new 
  ones too. Since this country was founded on the concept of freedom of religion, 
  the market for sacred songs was brisk and many a composer made a good living 
  by composing sacred songs. I've enjoyed producing this feature. Many of the 
  songs are well known, some may be completely new to you. As our gift to you, 
  all scorch versions this month can be printed so you can enjoy the music in 
  your own home if you play the piano. After all, I've no doubt that the inspiration 
  for these songs came straight from God and as such, must consider them God's 
  gift to all of us and certainly deserving of free distribution. You'll also 
  find that this feature is rather devoid of fancy covers. Except for two or three, 
  most are rather plain proving that sometimes great treasures come in simple 
  packages.
<P align="left">&nbsp; 
<P align="left">If any of you have songs you'd like to contribute to future issues 
  we'd love to consider your submission for publication. The <a href="/policy/submissions.php" target="_blank">&quot;rules&quot; 
  for submissions can be found here</a>, we'd love to have submissions by any 
  of our readers, anytime and would enjoy having a &quot;reader submission&quot; 
  or &quot;favorites&quot; feature from time to time. Heck, get involved, help 
  us out and write a feature for us! 
<P align="left">&nbsp;
<p>Come with us now as we revisit the wonderful music of America's faith. Go back 
  to a time when freedom of religion was unfettered by liberal exclusions and 
  the pressure of groups who want the only freedom of religion to be none. As 
  always, this issue is on two separate pages so don't miss <a href="featureb.php" target="_blank">page 
  two of this issue</a>.</p>

      <br>
      Music by: Herbert Johnson<BR>
      Lyrics by: from the Catholic Liturgy<BR>
      Cover artist: unsigned<br>
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <P>Trying to decide which song to present first was difficult but this one 
        seemed to be a good beginning. The traditional Catholic prayer to Mary, 
        Mother Of Jesus, seemed an appropriate beginning. A popular text, the 
        Ave Maria has been set to music in a number of ways by many of the world's 
        greatest composers. We featured a version by Gounod in our <a href="/issues/2001-12/thismonth/feature.php" target="_blank">Classics 
        in the Parlor</a> feature in December of 2001. Many songs by this title 
        have been written, using differing texts but all are intended for one 
        purpose; to sing the praises of the Mother of Christianity. This setting 
        uses the majority of full Latin text of the &quot;Hail Mary&quot; and 
        we've included the full Latin and English texts of the prayer in our lyrics 
        box (see the link below) for you to compare to Johnson's setting. He managed 
        to capture the majority of the text. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>Johnson's setting for the song is perhaps one of the most familiar to 
        many people and is a beautiful flowing piece that expresses the peace 
        and passion of and for Mary. Using a continuing flow of triplet based 
        arpeggios in the left hand and a beautiful melody in the right hand with 
        simple harmonies, Johnson created one of the masterpieces of modern sacred 
        music when he wrote this work. A middle section that brings feeling of 
        mystery and awe beaks the flow and provides a prelude to a triumphant 
        return to the original theme. On hearing it, one cannot deny the feeling 
        of power and strength of faith that can be communicated through music. 
      </P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><b>Herbert Johnson </b>(1857 - 1904)<b> </b><EM>Ave Maria</EM> may have 
        been one of the last songs written by Johnson for he died the year after 
        its publication. We know that he wrote many other hymns and sacred songs, 
        many of which are stunning such as Ave Maria and <EM>Face To Face</EM> 
        (also in this feature) yet very little seems to have been retained about 
        his entire output and life. There also appears to be some evidence of 
        a few secular songs by Johnson although a catalog of his output seems 
        to be lacking.</P>

        David's Harp</H2>
      <H3>1912</H3>
      <p><br>
        Music by: Louis Weber<BR>
        Lyrics by: none, piano solo<BR>
        Cover artist: unsigned</p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>Of course, the old testament was a rich source of inspiration for music 
        and here we see a work based on King David as well as a number of other 
        biblical moments. In this case, rather than a hymn or song, we have an 
        example of a common musical piece from the period called a meditation. 
        Though no lyrics are included, Weber has annotated all of the main themes 
        with commentary or biblical quotes to share with us his source for inspiration 
        and interpretation of the music. It works quite well and I can imagine 
        a family listening to this work and contemplating the commentary provided 
        by Weber and the musical meanings as it relates to his references. 
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p>The first section is titled; &quot;The King's song of praise&quot; and 
        is meant to convey an image of King David, playing his harp in praise 
        of the Lord. Weber uses arpeggiated chords to convey the sound of a harp 
        and a nice melody (reminiscent of <a href="/content/s/stareast.htm" target="_blank"><EM>Star 
        of The East</EM></a><EM>,</EM> scorch format) that manages to hold your 
        attention in spite of the ennui that a long passage of arpeggiated chords 
        can sometimes induce. The second section; &quot;rejoice and be glad&quot; 
        moves the melody to the left hand accompanied by repeating triplet chords, 
        a common musical contrivance in the early 1900's. A change of key also 
        helps change the mood. A return to the home key and the next passage is 
        &quot;The Heavens Declare Thy Glory&quot; and Weber weaves a melody with 
        repeated chords that could symbolize the trumpets of Heaven announcing 
        God's glory that leads to the darkest passage within this work but the 
        one I consider most beautiful and passionate. &quot;Though I walk through 
        the shadow of the valley of death, I shall fear no evil&quot; in an andante 
        6/8 time with a doleful bass clef melody accompanied by arpeggios conveys 
        a fearful yet triumphant passage to the next delightful tune &quot;I shall 
        dwell in the house of the Lord,&quot; a lighthearted tune complete with 
        chirping birds brings us to the end of Weber's piece. Hopefully, you are 
        using the Scorch player to view our scorch versions of these songs, otherwise, 
        you're missing the ability to see the commentary and musical craftsmanship 
        that these composers have passed on to us. 
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p>Sadly, I'm unable to find any information about the talented composer 
        of this work, <b>Louis Weber</b> or the Weber Brothers Publishing House 
        in Kansas City. Perhaps a kind reader from that area can provide us with 
        some information. If so, we'll be happy to add it to this article.

      <h3>1892</h3>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><br>
        Music by: Stephen Adams<br>
        Lyrics by: F.E. Weatherly<br>
        Cover artist: unknown</p>
      <p>This work has become a staple in many a modern church and is one that 
        simply screams out its message in the chorus. One aspect of every song 
        in this month's feature is their compositional nature. Almost all songs 
        we see in the popular song style are in what is called the strophic form. 
        That is, repeated verses and the chorus are sung to repeats of the original 
        melody. All of these sacred songs have been written down in a through 
        composed form, that is, there are no repeats, the music and lyrics continue 
        straight through from beginning to end. And though the composers have 
        in almost all cases, provided what appears to be a verse-chorus construct, 
        through composition allows for subtleties in variation of the original 
        theme. Try to notice that as we progress through this month's songs. This 
        can be very effective in conveying differing moods for each &quot;verse&quot; 
        as you may see in the beautiful In The Garden on the second page. 
      <p>&nbsp;
      <p>Adams has provided us with a beautiful flow for this song and the through 
        composed nature makes it appear a lot longer on paper than if it were 
        strophic n design. Regardless, the song is one of the greatest hymns of 
        inspiration ever written and is a favorite of choirs in many different 
        Christian denominations. 
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p><b>Frederic Edward Weatherly</b> (1848-1929), was a songwriter and in 
        his later years, a radio entertainer. Born in Portishead, Somersetshire 
        in England he studied law at Braesnose College and was a barrister of 
        the Inner Temple in 1887. Weatherly also wrote a number of books including 
        children's books and several quite serious titles including <em>Questions 
        in Logic, Progressive and General</em>; <em>The Rudiments of Logic, Inductive 
        and Deductive</em> and <em>Musical and Dramatic Copyright</em>. He also 
        was a prolific poet, which was the source of his song lyric talent as 
        well. 
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p>Weatherly wrote hundreds of songs among them few if any that have survived 
        the decades since like <EM>Danny Boy</EM> has. Among his &quot;lost works&quot; 
        are; <em>In Sweet September</em>, <em>The Deathless Army</em>, <em>The 
        Midshipmate</em> and <em>Polly</em>. He also wrote other works that have 
        survived the ages and are still well known including <em>London Bridge</em>, 
        and <em>When We Were Old and Gray</em>. Little noticed today, Weatherly 
        ranks at the top of the list of 19th and early twentieth century songwriters 
        in terms of output having produced thousands of songs. 
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p>According to Michael R. Turner and Antony Miall in <em>The Edwardian 
        Song-Book: Drawing-Room Ballads 1900-1914</em>, Methuen, London, 1982 
      <p><br>
      <p> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font size="-1">The most prolific poet of the Edwardian&#151;and for 
          that matter Victorian and Georgian&#151;ballad, the genial and indefatigable 
          Fred E. (Frederick Edward) Weatherly (1848-1929) was virtually a one-man 
          song factory. Seven of his lyrics appear in this book, but he wrote 
          thousands, of which at least fifteen hundred were published, with music 
          by dozens of composers who vied to get their hands on his verses. &#133;The 
          law was as much a love as poetry, and he studied and was called to the 
          Bar at the age of thirty-nine, thereafter enjoying a comfortable career 
          on the Western Circuit, often appearing in criminal cases, almost invariably 
          for the defence. According to his own account, in court he was remarkably 
          keen-witted and effective. Songs poured from him, he translated opera 
          (including Cav. and Pag.) and he published quantities of verse and children's 
          books. He revelled in his considerable celebrity. A little man physically, 
          he had, as a friend put it, 'a blithe and tender soul'. He may have 
          been self-satisfied but he was much loved and was certainly no fool, 
          cheerfully dismissing his facility as a lyricist as no safe ticket to 
          Parnassus. His most commercially successful ballad was 'Roses of Picardy' 
          which became one of the great popular songs of the Great War, and it 
          made its writer a small fortune.</font></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>According to his Brasenose biography, Weatherly came to Brasenose College 
        in Oxford, England from Hereford Cathedral School in 1867, and was awarded 
        a B.A. in Classics in 1871. In 1868 he achieved a certain fame on, or 
        in, the river. The Brasenose IV had practised for Henley Regatta without 
        a cox; on being informed that they must carry one they decided to do so, 
        but for him to jump overboard immediately after the beginning of the race. 
        Weatherly volunteered to take the dive and the crew went on to win the 
        race; although subsequently disqualified, they had established a precedent 
        from which the Coxswainless Fours were to develop. <br>
        <br>
        Weatherly earned his living first as a coach in Oxford and subsequently 
        at the Bar, but he is best known as a songwriter.<font size="-1">(Information 
        about Weatherly's Brasenose association courtesy <a href="http://www.bnc.ox.ac.uk/history/alu/page5.html">Brasenose 
        College</a> ) </font></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>One of the difficulties in finding biographical information on composers 
        or songwriters is the common use of pseudonyms. I was about to give up 
        on Adams when I discovered an entry that indicated Stephen Adams was actually:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p> <b>Michael Maybrick</b>, (1844 - 1913) born in Liverpool, England in 
        1844. He completed his music studies there and moved to Leipzig and Milan 
        to study further. He became a well known baritone singer. His first appearance 
        was in the New Philharmonic Concerts in London in 1870. His songs were 
        popular in both England and America. <font size="-1">( Above from the 
        <a href="http://www.notredamedefatima.org/MP3/177.htm">Our Lady Of Fatima 
        Parish Website</a> where you can hear a beautiful recording of the hymn)</font> 
        There is a rather bizarre theory abroad that Maybrick's brother, James 
        may have been the elusive &quot;Jack The Ripper.&quot; Very few of Maybrick's 
        songs ever reached the lasting level of popularity of <EM>The Holy City</EM> 
        but a few do survive. Among them are <cite>To The Front, The Star Of Bethlehem, 
        The Midship Mite and Mona.</cite><br>

      <P>I debated whether to include this song in this month's feature as it 
        is right on the fence between secular and sacred. Tied directly to <EM>The 
        Holy City</EM> (above) the song even nearly copies the chorus melody but 
        seems to cleverly avoid an outright copyright infringement. In a sincere 
        form of complement, the composer has drafted a song based upon the love 
        for the melody of <EM>The Holy City </EM>and it works well. The cover 
        is one of only two reasonably interesting covers this month and has a 
        definite religious theme to it. </P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P>Erdman and Lewis even manage to start the song off with the same line 
        as <EM>The Holy City</EM>; &quot;last night as I lay dreaming&quot; but 
        then moves to what appears to be a song about a sweetheart as he speaks 
        to &quot;The song you oft-times sang.&quot; Then we are transported back 
        to focus on the hymn with the words, &quot;It was 'The Ho-ly Cit-y' It 
        thrilled me through and through.&quot;. Then, with the chorus, we hear 
        an almost exact phrase from the original song; &quot;&quot;Je-ru-sa-lem, 
        Je-ru-sa-lem,&quot; Rang so soft and low&quot; then we drift back to the 
        sweetheart with &quot;My heart was glad For you were near, The same as 
        long a-go.&quot; Erdman and Lewis pull us back and forth like that for 
        the entire song and so we end up with a song that is a creative hybrid 
        of a sacred and secular song. The true secular nature comes through somewhat 
        in that this song is not through composed like all the rest. It is strophic 
        with multiple verses and repeats of the chorus. Still, I find it to be 
        a pleasant song and one that could easily fit into a musical Sunday in 
        the parlor.</P>

        Music by: Felix Mendelssohn<br>
        Lyrics by: Thomas Hastings<br>
        Cover artist: unknown</p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>Some of the world's greatest composers have written sacred music and 
        of course many, like Bach and Handel, built their entire life around serving 
        the Lord through music. Felix Mendelssohn, one of classical music's greatest 
        composers wrote many songs and piano works specifically for sacred purposes. 
        The music for this song was arranged by E.S. Hosmer from Mendelssohns, 
        Op 53, No. 4, one of his many <EM>Lieder ohne Wort</EM>, songs without words. 
        Mendelssohn wrote eight books of songs without words between 1825 and 
        1845 and: 
      <blockquote><cite>showed that the spirit of song could exist without words 
        to show the meaning. In fact, the pieces are a kind of personal diary 
        for the composer, expressing feelings he thought were impossible to put 
        into words in any case. </cite><font size="-1">(From<a href="http://www.artsworld.com/music-dance/works/s-u/songs-without-words-felix-mendelssohn.html" target="_blank">artsworld.com</a>)</font></blockquote>
      
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Hosmer took Mendelssohn's song four from Op. 53 and added words by Thomas 
        Hastings (1605 - 1685), an early American settler, church Deacon, poet 
        and hymn writer in Watertown Mass. Among Hastings' number of lasting hymns 
        including Rock of Ages. Mendelssohn's (or should I say, Hosmer's arrangement 
        of ) work is somewhat bleak, with a persistent bass line that carries 
        the melody through the piece. Hosmer's arrangement is quite accurate to 
        the original. I've a 1982 recording of the piece played by Edmund Batterby. 
        In that recording Battersby seems to play a little faster than an Adagio 
        tempo as the piece is marked and it really sounded much better than my 
        original, rather slow rendition so I've upped the tempo some and it goes 
        quite well. The original piece was titled, <i>Evening Song</i> so that 
        explains the rather dark character of the piece. Not necessarily a favorite 
        of mine from this month's feature, this hymn is clearly a classical piece 
        that has been modified for home or church use. The work is expressive 
        and melodic and perhaps would have been best left as Mendelssohn intended; 
        without words.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><img src="/images/Mendel05.jpg" width="114" height="170" align="left" vspace="10" hspace="10">Felix 
        Mendelssohn-Bartholdy (born Hamburg, 3 February 1809; died Leipzig, 4 
        November 1847). Born into a prominent family in Berlin, he grew up in 
        a privileged environment (the family converted from Judaism to Christianity 
        in 1816, taking the additional name 'Bartholdy'). He studied the piano 
        with Ludwig Berger and theory and composition with Zelter, producing his 
        first piece in 1820; thereafter, a profusion of sonatas, concertos, string 
        symphonies, and piano quartets revealed his increasing mastery of counterpoint 
        and form. </p>
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p>A period of travel and concert-giving introduced Mendelssohn to England, 
        Scotland (1829) and Italy (1830-31); after return visits to Paris (1831) 
        and London (1832, 1833) he took up a conducting post at D&uuml;sseldorf 
        (1833-5), concentrating on Handel's oratorios. During this period he composed 
        a number of excellent works that reflected the influence of his travels.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>With its emphasis on clarity and adherence to classical ideals, Mendelssohn's 
        music shows alike the influences of Bach (fugal technique), Handel (rhythms, 
        harmonic progressions), Mozart (dramatic characterization, forms, textures) 
        and Beethoven (instrumental technique), though from 1825 he developed 
        a characteristic style of his own.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Mendelssohn found inspiration in art, nature and history for his orchestral 
        music. The energy, clarity and tunefulness of the <em>Italian</em> have 
        made it his most popular symphony. In his best overtures, essentially 
        one-movement symphonic poems, the sea appears as a recurring image, from 
        <em>Calm Sea and Prosperous Voyage</em> and <em>The Hebrides</em> to The 
        Lovely Melusine. Less dependent on programmatic elements and at the same 
        time formally innovatory, the concertos, notably that for violin, and 
        the chamber music, especially some of the string quartets, the Octet and 
        the two late piano trios, beautifully reconcile classical principles with 
        personal feeling; these are among his most striking compositions. Of the 
        solo instrumental works, the partly lyric, partly virtuoso <em>Lieder 
        ohne Worte</em> for piano are elegantly written and often touching. </p>

        Music by: Charles Gounod<BR>
        Lyrics by: Mrs Cousins<BR>
        Cover artist: unsigned<br>
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <P>Initially my least favorite song of this month's selections, I'm afraid 
        this one is becoming an acquired taste and may soon be a favorite. My 
        first impression was that this work did not seem to measure up to my own 
        level of expectation for a work by Gounod. It seemed rather simple and 
        even superficial. As I've listened to it I've grown to appreciate that 
        often, less is more and Gounod has provided an interesting tune that would 
        play well in the home or church. Unfortunately, the sheet music I have 
        has no publication date but appears to have been published either around 
        the time of Gounod's death, or not long afterward. 
      <P>&nbsp; 
      <P>The &quot;Mrs. Cousin&quot; listed as the writer of the words was <b>Ann 
        Ross Cousin</b> (1824-1906 ) born Ann Ross Cundell in Yorkshire England, 
        &quot;a gifted nineteenth-century writer of many hymns and poems of great 
        beauty. Her most popular work has been this hymn, which first appeared 
        in 1857 in the Christian Treasury.&quot; <font size="-1">(Quote<a href="http://villa.lakes.com/irv/hymns/hymn-93.htm" target="_blank">from 
        &quot;Hymn Stories, No. 93</a>)</font> Interestingly, this text has been 
        used in a number of different musical setting. The original 1857 music 
        was written by Chretien D'Urhan, (1790-1845) so it seems that this hymn 
        never really had a marriage of words and music that were actually designed 
        specifically for the words. Rather, over time, music by different composers 
        was used to complement Mrs.. Cousin's poem. Cousin write several other 
        hymns including, <EM>King Eternal, King Immortal, O Christ, What Burdens 
        Bowed Thy Head, To Thee and to Thy Christ, O God, To Thy Father and Thy 
        Mother</EM>, and <EM>When We Reach Our Peaceful Dwelling</EM>. 
      <P>&nbsp;
      <P>From all this, we can conclude that Gounod's music was written for some 
        other purpose and later arranged for this text by an uncredited arranger 
        in this version. I'm not sure what the original setting for this music 
        was. Perhaps an alert student of Gounod's music can identify the tune 
        and its origin and let us know. 
      <P>&nbsp;
      <P><img src="/images/gounod.jpg" width="172" height="250" align="right" vspace="10" hspace="10"><b>Charles 
        Fran&ccedil;ois Gounod</b> ( b. Paris, 1818 - d. Paris, 1893) was the 
        son of a talented painter who had won some acclaim but died when Gounod 
        was four. Gounod's mother was a pianist who gave young Charles his early 
        musical education. He learned classical studies at the Lyc&eacute;e St. 
        Louis and studied music under Anton Reicha when in 1836 he entered the 
        prestigious Paris Conservatoire. There he received instruction from some 
        of the greatest musicians of the times. Gounod won the coveted Prix de 
        Rome three years later. In 1839, he traveled to Rome where he was deeply 
        impressed by the polyphonic music he heard sung in the Sistine Chapel.. 
        He then began a serious study of 16th century sacred music. It was in 
        the area of liturgical music that Gounod excelled throughout his life. 
        Arguably, his greatest work is the <em>Messe solennelle de Saint C&egrave;cile</em>, 
        first performed in 1855. Considered a masterpiece, it established his 
        successful style of ornate and elaborate work that was in contrast to 
        his earlier, more austere work.
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In 1842 he traveled to Vienna and then on to Berlin where he was exposed 
        to the music of the area and also received a commission to compose two 
        masses. His experience there made him unique among French composers in 
        that he had a deep knowledge of music, past and present that went beyond 
        the current French traditions and operatic style. Gounod returned to Paris 
        in 1843 to accept his first position as organist at the Missions Etrang&egrave;res 
        and soon was at odds with a congregation who disliked his steady diet 
        of Bach and 16th century music. Gounod seemed to understand that opera 
        was a key to success for a French composer. As such, he turned to composing 
        opera and his first, <em>Sapho</em> premi&egrave;red in 1851. Unfortunately, 
        in spite of compliments from renowned composers such as Berlioz, it was 
        a failure. He followed <em>Sapho</em> with several other works that fared 
        no better. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Thereafter followed a period of opera production where Gounod met with 
        much better success than he had earlier. Gounod produced <em>Le Medecin 
        malgr&eacute; lui</em> in 1858 and then <em>Phil&eacute;mon</em> in 1860. 
        These successes, combined with <em>Faust</em> in 1859, earned Gounod a 
        place as perhaps the most acclaimed composer in France. Like Mascagni 
        (see <em>Ave Maria</em> on page one of this feature) Gounod was to spend 
        the rest of his life in pursuit of an opera as well received as <em>Faust</em> 
        . Though he produced many more, none enjoyed the popularity of <em>Faust</em> 
        .</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>In the last years of his life, Gounod returned to religious music. He 
        became very successful in England and as such, he had a strong influence 
        on choral music there. It was Gounod's belief that France was a country 
        of 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>&quot;precision, neatness and taste, that is to say, the opposite of 
          excess, pretentiousness, disproportion and longwindedness&quot;</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>It is in this sense, a master of a refined and precisely restricted style, 
        that he is now regarded.</p>
