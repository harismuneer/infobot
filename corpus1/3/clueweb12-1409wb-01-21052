  <h1>Towards a better taxation of savings</h1>
  <h3>Address by Dr Ken Henry<br />
    Chair - Australia's Future Tax System Review Panel 
  and Secretary to the Treasury</h3>
  <h3>Address  to the Australian Conference of Economists Business Symposium<br />
  1 October 2009</h3>
  <p>Thank you for the opportunity to  address you today on taxation reform.</p>
  <p>I'd  like to extend my thanks to the convenors of this colloquium, Dr Tom Karmel and  others from the Economic Society of Australia, for this invitation to speak to  you today. </p>
  <p> The  Tax Review Panel of which I am chair is now more than a year into the  Australia's Future Tax System review. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer have  described it as 'root and branch' &mdash; the most comprehensive review of the  Australian taxation and transfer system, including state taxes, for at least  the last 50 years. </p>
  <p> One  of the more prominent parts of this ever growing plant, with its sprawling limbs,  runners and branches, is the taxation of the personal capital income of Australians  &mdash; broadly understood as income from 'saving'. </p>
  <p> I  have made a number of speeches on a range of issues associated with the tax  review, but the tax treatment of savings is not something I have directly  addressed.&nbsp; I would like to take the  opportunity today to do so.</p>
  <p> And  this is a timely opportunity.&nbsp; The global  financial crisis serves as a reminder that countries, like Australia, with high  rates of domestic investment cannot take for granted that it will always be  financed by a perfectly elastic supply of foreign saving to supplement domestic  savings.&nbsp; The level of domestic savings  matters.&nbsp; The composition of domestic  savings may also matter. This is particularly the case if there are significant  externalities involved in domestic saving being in a form that can adjust  quickly to shifts in foreign capital flows.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>    One  piece of anecdotal evidence that has captured my attention in the immediate  aftermath of the global financial crisis is the role played by Australian  superannuation funds in financing, through equity purchases, a large-scale  de-leveraging of corporate Australia.&nbsp; It  is not at all clear that such a large structural change in corporate financing  could have been achieved without our very substantial pool of superannuation  savings.</p>
  <p> Another  consideration worth thinking about is that while domestic investment can be  financed either by domestic saving or the saving of foreigners, the future  living standards of today's working Australians will have more to do with the  returns generated by the former &mdash; that is, the returns on their own savings.&nbsp; As the Australian population ages, the  quality of our domestic saving decisions is going to become increasingly  important.</p>
Personal capital  income taxes are taxes on saving.&nbsp; They  affect how consumption is distributed over a person's lifetime and, in turn,  the national level of saving. Further, the personal capital income tax settings  have other effects. Taxing savings reduces the gains from working, where some  of those gains are saved. It affects the allocation of a household's savings among  various assets as well as having important implications for equity.
<h3>Comprehensive income  taxation &mdash; three initial observations</h3>
  <p>In  Australia, personal capital income taxation policy, and tax policy more  broadly, has long been inspired by the ideal of comprehensive income  taxation.&nbsp; Typically this has involved a  concern with nominal, rather than real or inflation-adjusted, income.</p>
  <p> The  theoretical premise behind our version of this inspiration is quite elegant in  its appearance and relatively simple in its logic: a dollar of income is a  dollar of income, so it should be taxed at the same rates regardless of how it  is derived. All income should be treated the same whether it comes from a bank  account, shares, property or paid work.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>    At  face value, this argument is compelling. Proponents of comprehensive income tax  argue that it is unfair that things like capital gains are taxed less than paid  work: it should all be treated as taxable income. If someone earns $100,000  from capital gains or interest income, and someone earns $100,000 from work,  they should be taxed at the same rate.</p>
  <p> Allow  me to make three initial observations.</p>
  <p> My  first observation is self-evident to most economists. The example I just described  looked at comprehensive nominal income, rather than real income, as it included  both inflationary gains as well as actual increases in economic power (or real  gains). </p>
  <p> Consider  the following example. If you purchase an asset for $100 and sell it a year  later for $106 &mdash; earning a 6 per cent return &mdash; the full return ($6) is subject  to tax. If inflation was also 6 per cent then the real return is zero. The same  bundle of goods that cost $100 last year would cost $106 this year. So by being  taxed on the inflationary return you are no longer able to consume the same  bundle of goods in the future that you could consume today. </p>
  <p> We  can see this from the first chart (Chart 1). Consider a taxpayer who faces a  statutory tax rate of 30&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent for both their labour income and their  income yielded from an asset (say an interest income stream). The effective tax  rate on labour income consumed today is a neat 30&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent; the column  on the left.</p>
  <p class="chart_heading">Chart 1: Taxing the Infationary Gain</p>
  <p><img src="/content/html/speeches/_images/09_Chart_1.jpg" width="634" height="390" alt="Chart 1: Taxing the Infationary Gain" /></p>
  <p> On  the other hand, the column on the right represents the effective tax rate on  the income from the asset. Had inflation been zero, the effective tax rate on  the income from the asset would also have been the 30&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent  statutory rate. However, even under low rates of inflation, the real effective  tax rate on capital income can be much higher than the statutory tax rate. Assuming  a nominal return of 6&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent per annum and 2.5&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent  inflation, the real effective tax rate would be around 51&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent, two-thirds  higher than the statutory tax rate. </p>
  <p> Comprehensive  nominal income taxation does not actually treat labour and capital income the  same. For them to be treated the same, an adjustment for inflation is needed.</p>
  <p> The  second observation to note is that whenever we consider the taxation of  personal capital income, the effect of means testing government benefits needs  to be taken into account. While means tests and income taxes have a different administrative  basis, they can have similar economic impacts. </p>
  <p> The  withdrawal of benefits can lead to disincentives to work and the same logic  extends to savings. Empirical research bears this out, showing that means  testing affects decisions to work and save<a href="#ftn1" name="ftnref"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
  <p>    So  the tax and transfer systems impose taxes on savings, be it through capital  gains tax, income tax, an assets test or an income test.&nbsp; How these two systems fit together is  something the Panel has been considering carefully.</p>
  <p> My  third observation is that while many in Australia continue to see comprehensive  income tax as the ideal, seminal reviews into taxation around the world in the  last three decades have largely gone the other way. These reviews, carried out  by leading public finance economists, have abandoned even the comprehensive <em>real</em> income ideal, let alone comprehensive <em>nominal</em> income.&nbsp; The US  Treasury <em>Blueprints for Basic Tax Reform</em> in 1977  and the Meade Committee Review in the United Kingdom in 1978 are examples. Based  on their publications to date, the current Mirrlees Review being conducted by  the UK Institute of Fiscal Studies appears likely to follow this trend. </p>
  <p> The  fact is that comprehensive income taxation has, for some time, been considered  by many economists as 'old thinking'. Looking at the recent work in this area,  there are arguments for taxing savings at a higher rate than labour, arguments  for taxing savings at a lower rate than labour, arguments for subsidising  saving and there are even arguments for taxing savings at age&#8209;dependent rates. However,  as Professor Auerbach from Berkeley pointed out at the AFTS conference in  Melbourne in June, he was not aware of any recent credible work that would  suggest that taxing capital income at the <em>same</em> rate as  labour is optimal, other than for administrative reasons. </p>
  <p> Notwithstanding  the declining theoretical support for comprehensive income taxation, many of  the major reform exercises in Australia in the last three decades, inspired by  the Asprey Taxation Review in the 1970s, have involved trying to move the legal tax base closer to  comprehensive income.&nbsp; And I would argue that these reforms have,  generally, been highly beneficial.</p>
  <p> Before  I further discuss some of the broad policy choices, it is worth reflecting on how  the personal capital income tax system in Australia has evolved and what it is  today.&nbsp; Doing so will give context to a  discussion of the competing benchmarks.</p>
  <h3>Past changes</h3>
  <p>Prior  to Asprey, the tax laws recognised many items that were in an economist's  definition of nominal capital income: profits from a business, interest, rent,  dividends and other periodic receipts. These were generally included in the  calculation of taxable income and taxed at the same progressive rates as labour  income. </p>
  <p> Items  that were not recognised back then, or only brought into the tax base to a  limited extent, included: fringe benefits, capital gains, superannuation  earnings, retirement lump sum benefits, imputed rent from owner&#8209;occupied  housing and consumer durables, bequests and gifts received. Of these untaxed or  lightly taxed items, it has been in the areas of capital gains and  superannuation where most changes in the taxation of savings have occurred since  Asprey. </p>
  <p> Capital  gains became generally taxed through the capital gains tax provisions from 1985.  Inflation adjustments were provided so that what was taxable was more like real  income &mdash; but on a realisation basis. It was, of course, recognised that capital  gains were still being treated more favourably than some other forms of capital  income, such as interest income, because of the inflation adjustment and the  deferral of taxation to realisation.</p>
  <p>Capital gains  indexation lasted 15 years. The <em>Review of Business  Taxation</em>, chaired by Mr&nbsp;John&nbsp;Ralph, proposed the abolition  of capital gains indexation and averaging to be replaced by a capital gains tax  discount. As a result, and subject to certain conditions, individuals today  include only 50&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the realised nominal capital gain from  assets in their taxable income. Superannuation funds were afforded a capital  gains tax discount of one&#8209;third of the realised nominal gain. </p>
  <p>A  second area of significant reform was the taxation of superannuation. Prior to 1988,  superannuation pensions were treated largely on a post-paid expenditure tax  basis &mdash; close to what is often called a 'big E, big E, big&nbsp;T', or EET,  treatment. That is, contributions into superannuation funds were exempt (the  first 'E'), the fund earnings were exempt (the second 'E') while retirement  benefits were pretty much fully taxed (the 'big T' at the end, although lump  sum benefits were taxed as a 'little t'). </p>
  <p> Since  then, the tax burden has been shifted away from the taxation of retirement  benefits, with taxes being applied at the contributions and earnings level, but  generally at concessional rates. </p>
  <p> Under  current arrangements, superannuation benefits paid from a taxed source are tax&#8209;exempt  when paid to a person over sixty. Contributions are subject to a  15&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent contributions tax and earnings in the fund are also taxed  at a 15&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent statutory rate. However, the average effective tax rate  on earnings, based on tax revenue collected as a proportion of pre&#8209;tax fund  earnings, is more like 7-8&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent because of the capital gains tax discount  and refundable imputation credits. Focussing on the effective rate rather than  the statutory rate makes sense to the extent that an imputation credit to  resident shareholders is a refund for a tax that they, given that Australia is  an open economy, have not entirely borne.</p>
  <p> The  current treatment can be described as 'little t, little t, big&nbsp;E'. Contributions  are taxed at a low rate (the first 'little t'), as are fund earnings (the  second 'little t') while benefits withdrawn at retirement after age 60 are  exempt (the 'big E' at the end). </p>
  <p> That  said, the first 'little t' can be misleading &mdash; especially when compared to  other forms of saving. Unlike a bank account, the individual is effectively  getting a deduction for saving into superannuation at their marginal tax rate &mdash;  which, for higher marginal tax rate individuals is then only partially  corrected by the 15&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent contributions tax. Access to a partial  deduction for saving (or access to co-contributions), the very low rate of tax  on earnings and the exemption of retirement benefits mean that, for many  individuals, especially those on top marginal tax rates, saving into superannuation  is afforded a better&#8209;than&#8209;expenditure tax treatment. </p>
  <h3>The overall picture  today</h3>
  <p>So,  how far has the inspiration of comprehensive nominal income taxation got us and  what is the shape of the current treatment of capital income? </p>
  <p> For  personal capital income, the answer to that question is 'not very far and not  very consistently'. Our income tax system resembles an <em>ad hoc</em> dual income tax &mdash; where capital income is generally treated separately and  concessionally. However, unlike what may be considered a pure dual income tax model,  different savings types are treated at a variety of different effective tax rates. </p>
  <p> Consider  the following chart (Chart 2), which estimates forward&#8209;looking real effective  marginal tax rates on hypothetical saving, in assets commonly owned by middle  income taxpayers. The real effective marginal tax rates show the tax levied on  the normal return to saving, which is made out of after-tax labour income. A zero  effective tax rate represents the (pre-paid) expenditure tax treatment.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class="chart_heading">Chart 2: Different Treatment of Savings Types</p>
  <p align="center"><img src="/content/html/speeches/_images/09_Chart_2.jpg" alt="Chart 2: Different Treatment of Savings Types" width="525" height="361" /></p>
  <p>    As  mentioned earlier, concessional superannuation is treated more favourably than  the expenditure tax benchmark. This yields a large negative effective tax rate.  Note that these calculations ignore the effect of means tests.&nbsp; The tax imposed on retirement through means  testing would, if factored in, have the effect of increasing these effective  tax rates. </p>
  <p> For  interest bearing deposits, the real effective tax rate is well above the  taxpayer's 31.5&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent statutory rate (around 50&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent)  as the entire real and inflationary gain is included in taxable income. This is  consistent with comprehensive nominal income taxation. </p>
  <p> Ignoring  local property levies, whose incidence is most probably capitalised into  property values, owner-occupied housing is outside the capital income tax base  and faces a zero effective tax rate. </p>
  <p> Rental  properties, however, face different effective tax rates depending on the  financing choice of the saver &mdash; a low positive effective tax rate when equity  financed but a negative effective tax rate when geared. The tax treatment of a  negatively geared property would typically involve the taxation of rental  income and the deduction of interest and other expenses at the full personal  marginal rate, with capital gains taxed at a half rate due to the capital gains  tax discount. This throws up a significant asymmetry. </p>
  <p> The  same result applies for other types of geared investments that yield capital  gains. The treatment of foreign shares, or shares in Australian companies that invest  offshore, have similar characteristics to the treatment of rental property in  that capital gains are afforded the discount.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>    Listed  shares in companies with domestic investments are eligible for imputation  credits on top of the capital gains tax discount. Thus, the effective tax rate  for franked dividends is lower than for dividends from foreign shares. </p>
  <p> According  to the Australian Bureau of Statistics, as shown by the chart on-screen (Chart  3), the principal holdings of Australian households are: </p>
  <ul>
    <li> their own home (44  per cent of household assets) which is untaxed through the income tax system; </li>
    <li> other property &mdash;  including rental property (16 per cent) which is lightly taxed;</li>
    <li> superannuation (13  per cent) which is at most lightly taxed;</li>
    <li> shares and  interests in trusts (12 per cent) (labelled 'other financial assets' in the  chart) which are lightly to moderately taxed;</li>
    <li> personal use assets  (11 per cent) which are untaxed; and </li>
    <li> bank accounts and  bonds (4 per cent) which are fully taxed at marginal rates.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="chart_heading">Chart 3: Composition of Household Assets</p>
<p class="chart_graphic"><img src="/content/html/speeches/_images/09_Chart_3.jpg" width="607" height="384" alt="Chart 3: Composition of Household Assets" /></p>
  <p>Clearly we have a  savings tax base that exempts the lion's share of savings (owner-occupied  property, personal use assets), fully taxes a very small proportion of savings  (returns from interest&#8209;bearing deposits), and lightly to moderately taxes  everything else at varying rates. </p>
  <p>Superannuation is  affected by the Superannuation Guarantee.&nbsp;  But voluntary contributions are also large. It seems plausible, then,  that the particular allocation of household savings among various assets has  something to do with the tax system.&nbsp; And  we might well enquire whether that particular allocation of savings - and the  particular tax system applying to them - is in any sense optimal .</p>
  <p>Is this the way in  which the various forms of domestic saving should be taxed if we are to deal  effectively with the looming economic, social and environmental challenges  associated with population ageing and the probability of persisting, for many  years into the future, with one of the highest rates of investment - in plant,  capital equipment and infrastructure - in the developed world?</p>
<h3>Policy considerations </h3>
  <p>Would  it be better to continue with the ideal of comprehensive income taxation that has  had so much influence in Australian tax policy up until now, or to opt for an  expenditure tax approach? </p>
  <p> This  takes us back to my third initial observation, that the logic of income from  all sources &mdash; even disregarding inflationary gains &mdash; being subject to a common  progressive tax schedule is now widely accepted to be flawed. </p>
  <p> Consider  the following table (Table 1).</p>
  <p class="chart_heading">Table 1: Arguments for Each Base</p>
  <p><img src="/content/html/speeches/_images/09_Table_1.jpg" width="613" height="406" alt="Table 1" /></p>
  <p> If  we consider savings as deferred consumption &mdash; that is, consumption at different  dates like the consumption of different goods &mdash; taxing future consumption at  higher rates has important implications. Economic theory in this area, based on  the work by Sir&nbsp;Anthony&nbsp;Atkinson and Joseph Stiglitz in the 1970s, suggests  that if the labour income tax schedule is chosen optimally, then under fairly  reasonable conditions social welfare cannot be improved by taxing commodities  differently. Therefore social welfare can not be improved by taxing current and  future consumption differently, if wellbeing is based on a lifetime as opposed  to annual perspective.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>    This  result is more compelling the more you look out into the future. If you impose  a 30&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent tax on the returns to both work and saving, the  effective tax rate on consumption if you consume immediately is 30&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent.  But, even when inflation is ignored, the tax on real capital income not only  distorts current and future consumption, but distorts consumption more and more  as it is deferred further into the future &mdash; as the tax on earnings has a compounding  effect over time. If you defer consumption for 10 years the effective tax rate  rises to around 40&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent. If you defer consumption for 20 years, it  rises to around 50&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent. When inflation is taken into account, the  compounding effect of the tax rates is, of course, even more extreme.</p>
  <p> So,  even if it were optimal to tax future consumption at a higher rate than current  consumption, it is unlikely that it would be efficient to tax future  consumption at higher and higher rates the longer it is deferred. The comprehensive  income tax discriminates against taxpayers who save in the earlier stages of  life, with those individuals paying a higher lifetime tax bill than people with  similar earnings who choose to save less<a href="#ftn2" name="ftnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
  <p> Further,  there are practical difficulties in valuing and assessing economic income, even  for things like business profits, let alone items such as unrealised capital gains  and imputed rent.&nbsp; So achieving uniform  taxation of all forms of nominal capital income is problematic, to say the  least.</p>
  <p> The  only coherent reason for taxing on a nominal income basis is that treating  labour and capital income at different statutory rates can lead to  administrative difficulties in addressing the incentive to recharacterise  labour income as capital. &nbsp;There is much  in this practical argument.&nbsp; However,  under current tax arrangements, we already face it.</p>
  <p> Unfortunately,  while the case for comprehensive income taxation is flawed, the case for  adopting an expenditure tax is also far from watertight.&nbsp; Even from a theoretical perspective, there  are a number of arguments suggesting that a positive tax rate on the normal  return to saving may be part of an optimal tax system. </p>
  <p> The  Atkinson-Stiglitz result assumes that the labour income tax schedule has been  selected optimally and that present and future consumption are equally  substitutable for leisure. But when this schedule is not optimal, a tax on  saving may, depending upon the complementarity of leisure and future  consumption, also offset the negative impacts on labour supply arising from the  labour income tax. </p>
  <p> Also,  individuals with more education tend to have higher savings rates than people  with less education. If the level of education is a signal for innate ability (or  earnings capacity) then a tax on savings will tend to fall disproportionately  on more able individuals. It is argued that this will assist the government to  redistribute income from high ability to low ability individuals in a less  distortionary manner. </p>
  <p> There  are also transitional and design issues. An expenditure tax would tax  consumption from existing wealth while only providing a deduction for new  saving. </p>
  <p> If,  instead, an expenditure tax were to be implemented by simply exempting capital  income from tax, existing wealth would be afforded a positive windfall. Further,  supernormal returns, which do not affect savings decisions, would also become tax  exempt. And exempting capital income would come at an efficiency cost since it  would have to be funded by raising distortionary taxes elsewhere. </p>
  <p> What  I have just discussed are arguments concerning efficiency. Unsurprisingly, the  equity arguments are even more heated.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>    Advocates  for comprehensive income argue that capacity to pay is reflective of the amount  by which an individual's ability to purchase goods and services has increased  in a given period. So the income benchmark is the incremental increase in the <em>undiscounted</em> value of lifetime consumption.</p>
  <p> By  contrast, expenditure benchmark proponents argue that the amount of tax an  individual should pay in a given period should be based on the incremental  increase in <em>discounted</em> lifetime consumption  possibilities. Normal returns to saving do not increase consumption  possibilities &mdash; they merely reflect compensation for consumption deferral. Returns  to labour (and economic rents) do, however, represent an increase in  consumption power, whether they are consumed now or later. </p>
  <p> To  put it more intuitively, the income benchmark argues that 'people who have more  wealth should pay more tax' while the expenditure benchmark argues that 'people  who save more than others of the same labour income shouldn't pay more tax'. These  equity considerations are quite contentious and can be argued either way.</p>
  <p> So  what should we make of all this? There is probably no clear cut answer that allows  us to pick one benchmark over another.&nbsp;  We are in a more complicated, less certain, world of trying to find a  more efficient and fairer balance in the taxation of savings, including taking  account of interactions with the transfer system. </p>
  <h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>
  <p>Let  me sum up. </p>
  <p> We  have a system for taxing personal capital income that has evolved into  something that is, to put it mildly, far from the originally intended ideal. </p>
  <p> Further,  the case for staying true to that original ideal now appears weak; while the case  for moving to the other conceptual ideal is not strong either. </p>
  <p> Meanwhile,  we have a tax system for household saving that has not been calibrated to  address the challenges of population ageing and the financing of unprecedented  levels of business investment and infrastructure.</p>
  <p> While  we can see that we have a system that is ripe for reform, we can also see a  complex set of tradeoffs in respect of the choice of the savings base, the  choice of rate and the forms in which such a tax might be levied. Judgement is  required.</p>
  <p> Over  the next couple of months, we will be refining our judgements on these  important issues as we finalise our report on the tax and transfer system.&nbsp; Thank you for your interest.</p>
