The Dog Fight

The Americans and Russians at the height of the arms race realized
that if they continued in the usual manner they were going to blow up
the whole world.  One day they sat down and decided to settle the
whole dispute with one dog fight.

Each side would have five years to breed the best fighting dog in the
world and which ever side's dog won would be entitled to dominate the
world.

The Russians found the biggest meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female
dogs in the world and bred them with the biggest meanest Siberian
wolves.  They selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from each
litter to rebreed.

After five years the biggest meanest dog the world that had ever been
seen had been bread.  Its cage needed steel bars that were five inches
thick and nobody could get near it.

When the day came for the dog fight, the Americans showed up with a
strange animal.  It was a NINE foot long Dachshund.  Everyone felt
sorry for the Americans because they knew there was no way that this
dog could possibly last ten seconds with the Russian dog.

When the cages were opened up, the Dachshund came out of it's cage and
slowly waddled over towards the Russian dog.  The Russian dog snarled
and leaped out of it's cage and charged the American dachshund.  But,
when it got close enough to bite the Dachshund's neck, the Dachshund
opened it's mouth and consumed the entire Russian dog in one bite.

There was nothing left at all of the Russian dog.  The Russians came
up to the Americans shaking their heads in disbelief.  "We don't
understand how this could have happened.  We had our best people
working for five years with the meanest Doberman and Rottweiler female
dogs in the world and the biggest meanest Siberian wolves."

"That's nothing", one of the American replied.  "We had our best
plastic surgeons working for five years to make an alligator look like
a Dachshund."
