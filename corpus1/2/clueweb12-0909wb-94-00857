<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Although this flag design dates back to the Arab revolt against the Ottoman Empire in 1916, it was officially adopted as the flag of the Palestinian people by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1964. In 2005, the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) adopted the flag as the flag of the State of Palestine. Today, the flag is flown widely by Palestinians and their supporters.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Within the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the boundaries of Palestine are subject to deep dispute. To the Palestinian people, the boundaries of Palestine are those made in the British Mandate of 1920–1948, excluding those of the Kingdom of Jordan, which became an independent Arab country in 1921. However, Israel conquered three-quarters of this territory by the end of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War and the remaining part, comprising the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem, were first occupied by Egypt and Jordan, but later conquered by Israel during the Six Days War in 1967.</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Since that time the question of establishing a &quot;State of Palestine&quot; with precise boundaries has been marred by periodic outbreaks of violence.  In 1993, the Oslo Peace Accords, signed by Yassir Arafat and then Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in Washington, managed to get an agreement between the Palestinians and Israelis.  Israel would pull out of the Gaza Strip and cities in the West Bank, while leaving the contested East Jerusalem in Israeli control. In 2005, Israel did unilaterally withdraw from the Gaza Strip as agreed in the &quot;Disengagement Plan,&quot; and all the Israeli settlers were evacuated from the Gaza Strip.  Control over the area was transferred to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) which was established to govern those areas from which Israel withdrew.</P>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In 1989, the League of Communists of Serbia selected Slobodan Miloševic to become the President of Serbia. By 1992, Slovene, Croatia, Macedonia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina had all declared independence from Yugoslavia, leaving only Montenegro and Serbia still calling themselves Yugoslavia.  This resulted in the outbreak of incredibly brutal warfare as different national and religious groups clashed, especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina.</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In 2003, Yugoslavia changed its name to Serbia and Montenegro; a new flag was anticipated, but never created because Montenegro declared itself independent in 2006. However, this new Serbian flag was adopted in August of 2004, featuring the traditional red-blue-white stripes with the Serbian royal arms near the hoist; the civil flag had the three stripes only.</P></TD>

The three points of the triangle are understood to stand for the three nationalities of Bosnia: Bosnian, Coat, and Serbs. It is also seen to represent the map of Bosnia which looks like a triangle.

The flag features white, blue, and yellow colors because they are often associated with neutrality and peace.</P>
<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Unfortunately, Bosnia/Herzegovina is home to three ethnic peoples and this precipitated a series of wars between the predominantly Muslim government and rebel Serbs (who wished to remain a part of Yugoslavia), rebel Coats (who wished to become a part of Croatia), and Bosnian government forces. In three years of war and bloodshed between 95,000 and 100,000 people were killed and more than 2 million left homeless.</P></TD>

In 1993, the UN also sent in peace keeping troops and set-up &quot;safe areas&quot; for refugees in several parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina. These United Nations safe areas were to be protected using &quot;all necessary means, including the use of force.&quot; By 1995, the situation in the UN safe areas was deteriorating and after the Sarajevo Massacre, one of the worst atrocities in Europe since World War II, something different needed to happen. Ultimately, the continued attacks on the UN safe areas, as well as the continued Siege of Sarajevo, resulted in a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina named &quot;Operation Deliberate Force.&quot;</P>

According to Amnesty International, most women trafficked into Kosovo from abroad are from Moldova, Romania, Bulgaria and Ukraine. </P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Regarding the flags, KFOR has always used the standard NATO flag (see above) outdoors at any NATO installation.  Until the mid-2008, the KFOR flag with the two compasses could only be seen indoors in some offices. A slightly different KFOR flag was used the same way between 2008 and mid-2009.  The two compasses were removed, and only the white-blue shield placed on it.  The most recent version was put into use in 2009.</P>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Following Ben Ali's departure, a state of emergency was declared and a coalition government under Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi was created, which at first included members of Ben Ali's party, the Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD), as well as opposition figures from other parties. Continued daily protests soon resulted in Ghannouchi, removing all former RCD members and finally Ghannouchi himself was forced to resign. In February of 2011, Beji Caid el Sebsi became Prime Minister, for how long is anybody's guess.</P></TD>

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">The Constitutional Democratic Rally (RCD - <I>Rassemblement Constitutionel Démocratique</I>) was the governing party in Tunisia during the years that Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was President. The party held strong majorities in both the Chamber of Deputies and the Chamber of Councilors, though elections in Tunisia were widely regarded as rigged. This contributed to the series of violent street demonstrations which pressured President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali into relinquishing authority and fleeing Tunisia.  After Ben Ali departure the incumbent president and prime minister both resigned from their memberships in the RCD, as did the remaining RCD-aligned ministers.</P> 
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">In February of 2011, Beji Caid el Sebsi took Mohamed Ghannouchi place as Prime Minister. Under his direction the Ministry of Interior banned all meetings and activities of the RCD party, and requested the courts to dissolve it. In March of 2011, the court in Tunis did outlaw the former ruling party and ordered the liquidation of all its assets and funds.  The Central Committee of the party was also dissolved at this time.</P>

Arab Spring protests in Syria also started in January of 2011 calling for political reforms and the reinstatement of civil rights, as well as an end to the &quot;state of emergency&quot; which has been in place since 1963.  In March, the Syrian security forces arrested about 15 children for writing slogans against the regime, reportedly the children were tortured and started widespread protest against the Paathy regime, which has ruling Syria since 1963.

In 1969, a swift and bloodless coup toppled the Libyan monarchy and proclaimed the new Libyan Arab Republic.  At that time thousands of Libyans took to the streets to demonstrate their support for the revolution.  When the new cabinet was announced the 27 year old commander-in-chief of the armed
forces, Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, took the title of Prime Minister.</P> 
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">This new flag for Libya was adopted and consisted of three equal horizontal stripes of red (top), white, and black. At that time it was assumed that a green star would be added for each on the white stripe, similar to the flag of the United Arab Republic and other Arab states.

	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">Major Arab Spring protests started across Yemen in January of 2011 and have continued. Demonstrators initially protested against governmental attempts to modify the constitution to further entrench their power base, current unemployment and economic conditions, and plain governmental corruption, but these protest soon included a call for the resignation of President Ali Abdullah Saleh.  In response to these protest, Ali Abdullah Saleh first stated that he would not seek another presidential term in 2013. However, protest continued, and many injuries and deaths were reported as attempts by riot police to stop the protesters intensified.  Late in May, actual urban warfare between allied Hashid tribesmen and army defectors against the security forces and militias loyal to Saleh broke out.</P>
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">To stop the violence, Saleh agreed to give up power in exchange for immunity, but a RPG attack in June left him and several other high-ranking Yemeni officials injured.  Saleh was evacuated to Saudi Arabia for treatment, and handed over power to the Vice President Abd al-Rab Mansur al-Hadi. In late September, Yemeni state-television announced that Saleh had returned to the country after three months amid increasing turmoil in a week that saw increased gun battles on the streets of Sana'a and more than a 100 deaths. It is unclear whether Saleh will remain in power, but protests have continued and are still ongoing.</P>

The following months were filled with reported arrests, tortures, and deaths. Most of the protestors were from the Shia Islamic sect who make up the majority of Bahrainis, but are disproportionately represented by the Sunni royal-led government.</P> 
	<P><FONT FACE="Arial">King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa declared a three-month state of emergency in March of 2011 and asked the military to reassert its control as clashes spread across the country.  At his request, troops from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, with the stated purpose of protecting essential facilities including oil and gas installations and financial institutions, entered Bahrain. Later thousands of Shia protesters arose in Iraq and Qatif in opposition to the Saudi-led intervention in Bahrain. Although in June the declared &quot;state of emergency&quot; ended, several large rallies were staged by the Shi'ite community demanding the release of detained protesters, greater political representation, and an end to sectarian discrimination. In June, Hasan Mushaima, Abdulhadi Khawaja, and several other opposition activists were sentenced to life in prison by a military court, and medical personnel were being prosecuted for treating injured protesters.  Since then, several human rights groups and news organizations have alleged they have been deliberately targeted by the Bahraini government.</P>
