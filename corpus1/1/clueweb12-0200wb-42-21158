<br />Submitted By: Piotr Zlotkowski (mczers at sgh dot waw dot pl)
<br />
<br />The Polish magazine "Tylko Rock" ("Only Rock") has published interviews
with all the members of 1972-74 King Crimson personnel.  Here is the most
interesting one (in my opinion) - with Richard Palmer-James. It's
re-translated into English, so only the essence of his words is
authentic. And of course I'm an author of all possible bad grammar.
<br />
<br />----------------------------------------------
<br />
<br /><i>TR: How did it come to your collaboration with King Crimson?</i>
<br />
<br />RPJ: John Wetton and I were going to school together. It was in the
sixties in Bournemouth. At that time we already made friends. And
also in those days we came to know Robert Fripp. And later, in 1972,
when John landed in King Crimson, he proposed me to try to replace
Peter Sinfield who had left earlier, and to take upon myself writing
lyrics for the group. He knew I had some experience, because I wrote
the lyrics for the first album of Supertramp, in which I was playing
for several months.
<br />
<br /><i>TR: What was Robert Fripp expecting from you when you were starting</i>
writing for King Crimson?
<br />
<br />RPJ: I don't know. I wasn't living in London then, but in Germany,
where I live till today. And I was communicating with the group via
John mainly. I received from him the tapes with very rough versions
of the pieces, which later was on the album "Larks' Tongues In
Aspic". And I was writing the lyrics for them for a few weeks. And
not before all the songs were recorded I had an occasion to talk
about the fruit of my work with Robert Fripp.
<br />
<br /><i>TR: "Easy Money" seems to be a sarcastic song about the stardom in</i>
the world of rock and pop music...
<br />
<br />RPJ: No, it wasn't to be the text about rock or pop star. It's more
general thing, about all these people who are guided by the lowest
motives in their lives. It's such a trifle, written by way of a joke.
You know, usually King Crimson's output is received with excessive
seriousness, whereas there was always an element of fun in it. Even
on the albums "Larks' Tongues In Aspic", "Starless And Bible Black"
and "Red", in fact incredibly gloomy ones. Also during the concerts.
It was a surprise even for me, when I found that King Crimson live is
not only something heavy, dismal and sophisticated but the great
rock'n'roll show, as well. Maybe it's hard to imagine when you listen
to the albums, but it was like this.
<br />
<br /><i>TR: It always seemed to me that the lyrics on "Larks' Tongues In</i>
Aspic" arose from the musician's experiences, but I see I was wrong.
"Exiles" may be interpreted as a confession of an artist doomed to
living on tours, but surely also in this case the source was
different...
<br />
<br />RPJ: Yes, indeed. I already lived out of England for two or three
years then. And you know, it's strange, but a few years of stay out
of Britain were sufficient to cut the umbilical cord binding me with
it. At heart I already wasn't British, but European. It's so till
today. I am not British at heart at all. Maybe I should add I'm not
German, as well. I'm European. Of such reflections originated
"Exiles" lyrics.
<br />
<br /><i>TR: How to interpret "Book Of Saturday"?</i>
<br />
<br />RPJ: It's a kind of a love song. There's something in it like looking
over the book, in which you insert pictures, fragments of your
writings, shopping-lists, memories, tickets. I don't mind that it's
an enumeration of such things. Rather that particular scenes in the
lyrics were seemingly recalled during the skimming over such a book.
This song is like going back to the memories about yourself from the
time when you were someone else.
<br />
<br /><i>TR: "The Night Watch" is of course about Rembrandt's painting. How</i>
did the idea of such unusual topic spring up?
<br />
<br />RPJ: This painting always seemed to me to be something mysterious.
You know, a few years earlier, yet at school, I spent much time on
studies of it. And at that moment I was still trying to penetrate
its secret. And the fruit was "The Night Watch", sort of a small
essay on seventeenth-century Holland and Rembrandt's situation as
a painter, and the tasks he had to undertake to survive. The problem
with "The Night Watch" lies in the fact that I'm not sure if such
considerations were suitable for a subject of a rock song. Besides,
I must say I had an occasion to find that for many King Crimson fans
"The Night Watch" lyrics remained something completely obscure.
<br />
<br /><i>TR: "Lament" is about fame...</i>
<br />
<br />RPJ: Yes, it tells outright about fame. "Lament" and "The Night
Watch" are probably the only lyrics written earlier than the music.
Because usually King Crimson compositions were first, and later I
was fitting lyrics to them. Yes, "Lament" is rather melancholy
reflection on everything connected with the things happening when
you appear on the stage and entertain the audience with your music.
<br />
<br /><i>TR: As far as I know Robert Fripp is the co-author of "The Great</i>
Deceiver" lyrics...
<br />
<br />RPJ: Yes, it's true. John called on me in Munich then and said:
"Listen, Robert has written this verse and would like it to be in
the lyrics of one of the pieces". And I replied: "OK, no problem".
I mean the words which later became the chorus of "The Great
Deceiver".  As far as I know these are the only lyrics Robert has
written for King Crimson. My duty was to create a setting for them,
to add a scenery. And a satiric song was written, such an ironical
comment on all commercial activities.
<br />
<br /><i>TR: Who is The Great Deceiver?</i>
<br />
<br />RPJ: It's the devil. After all the traces of the devil's presence
may be detected in many King Crimson pieces.
<br />
<br /><i>TR: Even in the name...</i>
<br />
<br />RPJ: Even in the name.
<br />
<br /><i>TR: Is "Fallen Angel" a song about the devil, too?</i>
<br />
<br />RPJ: This one I have written together with John Wetton. At first we
both prepared different versions of the lyrics, and afterwards
integrated fragments of a few of them. It's a song about a big city,
about nightmares it abounds with.
<br />
<br /><i>TR: In "Starless", the last piece on "Red", the last King Crimson</i>
album you were writing lyrics for, there are few words...
<br />
<br />RPJ: Yes, this one contains only twelve lines. And that's why writing
it was so difficult. I prepared five or six versions, each about
something quite different. I showed them to John and he choosed some
fragments, added something from himself and created a new whole. A
very impressional lyrics came to existence. It seems that they say
about a disappointment between two near friends, not only lovers. If
"Starless" may be interpreted, it's about a break-up of a friendship.
<br />
<br /><i>TR: Are the lyrics you've written for King Crimson still a reason</i>
for satisfaction?
<br />
<br />RPJ: Certainly. You know, I've written hundreds of lyrics since
then. I'm a professional writer now. But those lyrics were in the
writing in an exceptional situation. For the group ensured absolute
artistic freedom for me. Today something like that doesn't happen.
In any case, not with the groups which achieved a success all over
the world.
<br />
<br /><i>TR: Was dissolution of King Crimson in 1974 great disappointment</i>
for you?
<br />
<br />RPJ: O, yes. Since in my opinion the foursome Fripp, Wetton, Cross
and Bruford were something extraordinarly exciting on stage. And in
my view that King Crimson line-up had a chance to become the
classic British rock group. And it was something what Robert was
afraid of. And because I can respect his point of view I believe he
was entitled to say: "Stop. Not a single step forward".
