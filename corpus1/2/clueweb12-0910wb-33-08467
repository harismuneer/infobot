      <p><a name="ActiveTrader"></a>Traders have a large variety of new financial 
        products to trade: ETFs, E-Minis, single-stock futures, plenty of new 
        indices, and options and futures on almost everything. Learn how all these 
        new products are taxed &#150; as securities or commodities &#150; and 
        consider that commodities have lower tax rates. <br>
        <br>
        Good news! The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 (CFMA) created 
        an entire new batch of financial products to trade, and the new indices 
        created from the act are taxed as commodities, which have lower tax rates 
        then securities.<br>
        <br>
        Before you start incorporating some of the new financial products into 
        your trading program it&#8217;s wise to see how these new products are 
        taxed by the IRS. In general, all new products are either taxed as &#8220;securities&#8221; 
        or &#8220;commodities&#8221; and the latter have lower tax rates. So when 
        given the opportunity to trade a new product that is equivalent in all 
        respects except tax treatment, it will pay tax-wise to chose the &#8220;commodity&#8221; 
        taxed vehicle. <br>
        <br>
        If you are a business trader, understand ahead of time how incorporating 
        some of these new products into your trading program may affect your trader 
        tax status and election for mark-to-market accounting (MTM). <br>
        <br>
        For example, if you elected MTM for your securities trading business only 
        (and not for commodities) and you revise your business plan to trade E-Minis 
        almost exclusively, you won&#8217;t have ordinary loss protection on the 
        E-Minis, as they are taxed as commodities. <br>
        <br>
        Note: An edited version of this page content was published in the August 
        2003 issue of <em><a href="http://www.greencompany.com/EducationCenter/InTheMediaActiveTrader.shtml">Active 
        Trader</a></em> magazine (in the &quot;Business of Trading&quot; section 
        written by our Robert A. Green, CPA): &quot;What's the Difference? Besides 
        stocks, traders have a wide range of financial products to trade. In the

        products classified as commodities have tax benefits securities do not 
        have.&quot; <br>

        We updated this page to reflect the new, lower tax rates put in effect 
        after passage of the 2003 Tax Act: 35 percent on ordinary income and 15 
        percent on long-term capital gains. We point out the significantly lower 
        tax rates that apply to commodities traders (23 percent) vs. securities 
        traders (35 percent). <a href="#taxrates">Click here</a> for the details.

      <p><span class="copybd">Products are more complex, but taxes have gotten 
        simpler! </span><br>
        In the old days, before the Internet revolutionized online trading in 
        1997, a trader&#8217;s business and tax universe was in balance. <br>
        <br>
        The SEC and CFTC kept to their respective turfs for securities and commodities, 
        respectively, and the IRS taxed all instruments as either securities or 
        commodities. The lines of demarcation were clear for all. Most traders 
        focused on securities or commodities trading and few actively traded both.<br>
        <br>
        Wow, have things changed with the passage of the CFMA and the simultaneous 
        creation of an entire assortment of new product &quot;hybrids.&quot;</p>
      <p><span class="copybd">Commodity exchanges created products to appeal to 
        securities traders</span><br>
        The online trading revolution brought tremendous growth in the securities 
        markets with the advent of hot IPOs. Trading in tech and NASDAQ stocks 
        were all the rage in the late 1990s. <br>
        By 2000, the stock market bubble burst and securities and commodities 
        exchanges actively began to compete for customers by creating new products 
        that mirrored products created by the other exchange.<br>
        <br>
        Commodities exchanges felt they missed the stock market windfall, so they 
        rushed to market new flavors of &#8220;broad based&#8221; stock indices. 
        Commodity exchanges were successful, partially because of the tax advantages 
        for commodities traders (over securities traders).</p>
      <p><span class="copybd">Act and you shall find! </span><br>
        These new hybrid products created with the CFMA raised the ire of the 
        SEC. This new Act solved many of the outstanding regulatory and tax treatment 
        issues raised by these new products. <br>
        <br>
        The CFMA established a framework for joint regulation (by the SEC and 
        the CFTC) of single-stock futures and narrow-based security indexes.</p>
      <p>IRS issues were also solved because the CFMA updated the IRS definition 
        of &#8220;nonequity options&#8221; in IRC section 1256 contracts (commodities). 
        Now, both the IRS and regulatory definitions of &#8220;broad based&#8221; 
        indices are the same &#150; 10 or more stocks in an index. This is great 
        news for traders because now almost all indices are &#8220;broad based&#8221; 
        and taxed at the lower commodity tax rates (see below). <br>
        <br>
        Regulatory wise, broad-based security indices, which are not considered 
        security futures products, continue to trade under the sole jurisdiction 
        of the CFTC. Security futures products (i.e., single-stock futures) are 
        subject to the joint jurisdiction of the CFTC and the SEC. <br>
        <br>
        Methods for determining when an index is broad or narrow-based (for tax 
        and regulatory purposes) are discussed at <a href="http://www.cftc.gov/sfp/sfpbackground.htm" target="_blank">http://www.cftc.gov/sfp/sfpbackground.htm</a>. 
        <br>
        <br>
        For indices excluded from the definition of narrow-based security index 
        see <a href="http://www.cftc.gov/sfp/sfpcontractsapprovedprecfma.htm" target="_blank">http://www.cftc.gov/sfp/sfpcontractsapprovedprecfma.htm</a>. 
      </p>
      <p><span class="copybd">Under the CFMA almost all indices are now &#8220;broad 
        based&#8221; commodities</span><br>
        The main effect of the CFMA was to significantly expand the definition 
        of a &#8220;broad based&#8221; index, which is considered a commodity. 
        &#8220;Narrow based&#8221; indices are considered securities. <br>
        <br>
        Among assorted rules under the CFMA, the main rule states a &#8220;broad 
        based&#8221; index is comprised of 10 or more securities; likewise, nine 
        or fewer securities are a &#8220;narrow based&#8221; index.<br>
        <br>
        Under the CFMA, almost all futures and options on stock indices, and smaller 
        variations of indices (commonly known as &#8220;E-Minis&#8221;), are considered 
        &#8220;broad based&#8221; indices, treated as commodities. <br>
        <br>
        This is good news, because commodities have lower tax rates than securities 
        and now almost all indices are commodities.<br>
        <br>
        At the time of writing this article, we did not find one index that is 
        considered &#8220;narrow based&#8221; and taxed as a security. </p>
      <p><span class="copybd">Single stock futures are taxed like securities</span><br>
        The IRS states that, &quot;a gain or loss on the sale, exchange, or termination 
        of a securities futures contract generally has the same character as gain 
        or loss from transactions in the underlying security.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        &quot;For example, if the underlying asset would be a capital asset in 
        the hands of the taxpayer, gain or loss from the sale of the contract 
        is a capital gain or loss. This rule does not apply to securities futures 
        contracts that are not capital assets (they are inventory assets), nor 
        does it apply to products identified as hedging transactions, or any income 
        derived in connection with a contract that would otherwise not produce 
        a capital gain. Except as provided in the regulations, capital gain or 
        loss from the sale, exchange or termination of a securities futures contract 
        to sell property is treated as short-term capital gain or loss.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        &quot;A securities futures contract generally is defined as a contract 
        of sale for future delivery of a single security or a narrow-based security 
        index.&quot;<br>

      <p><span class="copybd">Securities traders pay higher taxes</span><br>
        Before the mid-1980s, the IRS treated all buyer and sellers of &#8220;capital 
        assets&#8221; (securities and commodities) in the same manner.</p>
      <p>Securities trading &#8220;realized&#8221; gains are &#8220;short-term&#8221; 
        capital gains subject to &#8220;ordinary&#8221; (marginal) tax rates, 
        with the exception being that if you hold a security position open for 
        12 months or longer, you benefit from a lower long-term capital gains 
        tax rates (20 percent vs. 38.6 percent). To pay for long-term capital 
        gains rates, Congress subjects securities traders to the onerous wash-sale 
        loss and straddle-loss deferral rules. Few securities traders keep positions 
        open for 12 months, so they pay the higher tax rate and are also penalized 
        with wash sale and straddle rules. This is simply not fair, but it is 
        the rule.</p>
      <p>In general, &#8220;securities&#8221; include: stocks, stock options (equity 
        options), narrow-based indices, single-stock futures (taxed like their 
        underlying stocks), mutual funds, exchange traded funds (QQQs, iShares, 
        SPDRs, etc.) and bonds. <br>
        <br>
        The taxability of options on ETF shares, where the underlying portfolio 
        or index is &#8220;broad based&#8221; is currently uncertain and requires 
        guidance from the IRS. </p>
      <p><span class="copybd">Commodities traders pay lower taxes</span><br>
        In the mid-1980s, Congress and the IRS significantly changed the tax code 
        to provide for important differences between securities and commodities 
        taxation.<br>
        <br>
        Shrewd commodities traders were setting up complex straddles (offsetting 
        positions) to avoid taxes by accelerating realized losses in the current 
        tax year and deferring the offsetting unrealized gains positions to the 
        next tax year. <br>
        <br>
        Congress and the IRS passed IRC Code section 1256 to close this tax shelter. 
        Section 1256 defines commodities and sets forth beneficial tax treatment 
        for commodities. <br>
        <br>
        Form 6781 apportions commodities gains and losses to Schedule D (Capital 
        Gains and Losses) with 60 percent long-term and 40 percent short-term. 
        Securities trading gains are all short-term on Schedule D, unless a trader 
        holds a security open for 12 months or longer (a rarity for traders).<br>
        <br>
        As mentioned previously, long-term capital gains rates are significantly 
        lower than short-term rates. The 2003 Tax Act lowered long-term rate to 
        15 percent and the short-term rate to 35 percent.<br>
        <br>

        <span class="copybd">Commodities </span>are section 1256 contracts taxed 
        60 percent at long-term capital gains tax rates and 40 percent at short-term 
        capital gains tax rates (i.e., ordinary income tax rates). <br>
        <br>
        Pre-2003 Tax Act: <br>
        60 percent multiplied by maximum long-term capital gains tax rate of 20 
        percent = 12 percent.<br>
        40 percent multiplied by maximum short-term capital gains tax rate (ordinary 
        rate) of 38.6 percent = 15.44 percent.<br>
        Net 60/40 blended tax rate = 27.44 percent.<br>
        <br>
        Post-2003 Tax Act: (the 60/40 split survived a last-minute attack from 
        the Senate)<br>
        60 percent multiplied by maximum long-term capital gains tax rate of 15percent 
        = 9 percent.<br>

        rate) of 35 percent = 14 percent.<br>
        Net 60/40 blended tax rate = 23 percent.<br>
      </p>
      <p>The 2003 Tax Act provides a rate reduction for commodities traders of 
        4.44 percent.<br>
        <br>
        <span class="copybd">Securities</span> are usually all short-term for

        Maximum short-term capital gains tax rate (ordinary rate) of 35 percent.<br>
        <br>
        The 2003 Tax Act provides a rate reduction for securities traders of 3.6 
        percent (for short-term tax rates).<br>
        For investors, long-term capital gains tax rates were reduced by 5 percent 
        or more. <br>
        <br>
        Notice that the reductions for securities traders (3.6 percent), commodities 
        traders/investors (4.44 percent) and securities long-term investors (5 
        percent) are similar. It is important to note the net tax rates, which 
        are significantly better for commodities traders vs. securities traders 
        (23 percent vs. 35 percent, respectively). <br>
        <br>
        <b>Effective dates:</b> The ordinary income tax rate reduction changes 
        are effective Jan. 1, 2003. The long-term capital gains rate reduction 
        changes are effective for sales and exchanges after May 5, 2003. For more

      <p><span class="copybd">Commodities defined</span><br>
        The definition of &#8220;commodities&#8221; in IRC Section 1256 include: 
        any regulated futures contract, any foreign currency contract, any non-equity 
        option, any dealer equity option and any dealer securities futures contract. 
        <br>
        <br>
        The big news in the CFMA is the updated definition for &#8220;non-equity 
        options,&#8221; which include &#8220;broad-based&#8221; indices. &#8220;Narrow 
        based&#8221; indices are considered &#8220;equity options&#8221; and taxed 
        as securities. Options relating to broad-based groups of stocks and broad-based 
        stock indices will continue to be treated as &#8220;non-equity options&#8221; 
        under section 1256. </p>
      <p><span class="copybd">Congress helped traders tax-wise</span><br>
        I applaud Congress for acting in a smart manner in their passage of the 
        CFMA. <br>
        <br>
        Traders are not investing in long-term securities, but instead looking 
        to trade any feasible instrument for a quick swing in price for profit.<br>
        <br>
        For traders, it&#8217;s a zero sum game. Now with the CFMA, all those 
        new indices are treated as commodities and commodity tax law is better 
        for traders. Commodities are marked-to-market at the end of each day (which 
        is the way a trader thinks), and the tax rates are lower. <br>
        <br>
        Congress needs to do more work and help more traders avoid the tax pitfalls 
        of securities taxation. Traders can help themselves with an IRC Section 
        475 mark-to-market election to avoid wash sales, straddle rules and capital-loss 
        limitations. </p>
      <p><span class="copybd">Special rules for currency trading</span><br>
        Currency traders transact in contracts on regulated commodities exchanges 
        (regulated futures contracts [RFC] on currencies &#8211; Section 1256 
        commodities) or in the non-regulated &quot;interbank&quot; market (a collection 
        of banks giving third-party prices on foreign current contracts [FCC] 
        and other forward contracts). <br>
        <br>
        Currency traders are taxed similar to commodities traders, except that 
        interbank currency traders must &quot;elect out&quot; of IRC section 988 
        (the ordinary gain or loss rules for special currency transactions) if 
        they want the tax-beneficial &quot;60/40&quot; capital gains rate treatment 
        of IRC section 1256. The principal intention of IRC section 988 is taxation 
        on foreign currency transactions in a taxpayer's normal course of transacting 
        global business. <br>
        <br>
        Most currency traders will want to make this election for the tax-beneficial 
        treatment of section 1256 (lower tax rates on gains).<br>

      <p><span class="copybd">Bottom line</span><br>
        For tax purposes, don&#8217;t be alarmed when you see an ever-growing 
        list of financial products to trade. How an item is taxed is not dependent 
        on the type of exchange it trades on. The current law that matters is 
        the CFMA, and the law actually simplified tax matters. Almost all indices 
        are 10 or more stocks (broad-based) and taxed like commodities. Single-stock 
        futures and ETFs are taxed like securities. When you have a choice, choose 
        the commodity for lower tax rates (60/40).<br>

        of Investment Taxation Baffle You</span></p>
      <p><span class="copybd">By Robert A. Green, CPA</span></p>
      <p>Let&#8217;s assume you are interested in trading a NASDAQ 100 instrument 
        because you are not an expert in any one particular stock and like the 
        broad nature of indexes instead. Next, notice that security and commodity 
        exchanges are competing for your business by offering you a few choices 
        in tradable NASDAQ 100 instruments. You can trade the NASDAQ 100 TRUST 
        (QQQ), an exchange traded fund (ETF). Alternatively, you can trade the 
        E-mini NASDAQ 100 (NQ), a smaller electronically traded version of the 
        NASDAQ 100 stock indexes, compliments of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
      </p>
      <p>What you may not know is that there are some significant differences 
        in taxation for the above two choices. </p>
      <p>The QQQ, like all ETFs, are taxed like securities, with short-term ordinary 
        tax rates up to 35 percent. The NQ, however, is taxed like most futures 
        contracts with the more tax-beneficial 60/40 tax treatment. Sixty percent 
        of trading gains are considered long-term (with maximum tax rates up to 
        15 percent), and 40 percent are considered short-term (with maximum tax 
        rates up to 35 percent). The maximum blended rate on commodities is 23 
        percent, which is 12 percent lower than the maximum rate on securities. 
        Wow, it suddenly occurs to you that you can save a bundle on trading the 
        NQ versus the QQQ. Just make sure that all other factors for these competing 
        choices do not trump the tax benefits.</p>
      <p>Commodities have lower tax rates than securities, and there are also 
        other important differences in taxation. Simply, commodities are marked-to-market 
        (by default) and, therefore, are exempt from important tax rules that 
        affect securities including: wash sales; straddles and constructive receipt; 
        and holding periods.</p>
      <p>Certainly, there are many other rules and nuances that traders should 
        understand before they start trading a given instrument, so be careful 
        to read the fine print; a product name does not always indicate how an 
        instrument is taxed. </p>
      <p><span class="copybd">The Markets Are Ahead of the IRS</span><br>
        Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O&#8217;Neil called the tax code an 
        abomination that needed to be scrapped and redone from scratch. He &#8220;retired&#8221; 
        early, and few pundits expect his vision to be executed. Thus, we are 
        all stuck with this abomination for some time to come.</p>
      <p>And, of course, the tax code is a work in progress. Congress uses &#8220;fiscal 
        policy&#8221; to encourage, reward and punish certain kinds of business 
        and investment behavior. Some of it may be labeled pork-barrel politics, 
        but some also is truly useful. </p>
      <p>In the case of taxation for securities and commodities, the current state 
        of the law does not have an equal playing field. Even though many types 
        of securities trade like commodities with a &#8220;zero-sum game,&#8221; 
        Congress has reacted to different events over the years and caused a &#8220;great 
        divide&#8221; between taxation for securities versus commodities. </p>
      <p>In the 2003 Act, Congress sought to close this gap, but powerful commodity 
        exchanges and lobbyists saved their cherished 60/40 treatment from being 
        repealed (in the last minute of a conference bill). It is anticipated 
        that Congress will try to close current gaps (in securities versus commodities) 
        again soon. In the meantime, many traders will seek to profit from these 
        gaps.</p>
      <p><span class="copybd">In the Eyes of the IRS, It&#8217;s Either a &#8220;Security&#8221; or 
        a &#8220;Commodity&#8221;</span><br>
        In the mid-1980s, Congress acted to stop widespread abuse by professional 
        commodity traders who were using straddles to avoid income taxes. They 
        would have offsetting positions and close losing positions in the current 
        tax year while keeping open their offsetting profitable positions through 
        year-end. To stop this abuse, Congress passed new, sweeping legislation 
        to provide for IRC Section 1256 contracts, which included most commodities 
        and futures contracts on commodities exchanges. This was the first significant 
        divorce of commodities and futures from securities. </p>
      <p>The most important element of IRC Section 1256 contracts was mark-to-market 
        accounting (MTM), which provided that all positions at year-end would 
        be treated as if sold at year-end using year-end prices. This had the 
        immediate chilling effect of killing off the use of commodity straddles 
        for tax avoidance. Now, both losing and profitable offsetting positions 
        would be reported in the current tax year. Clearly, MTM changed many important 
        fundamentals in the tax code, which favored long-term investing. </p>
      <p><span class="copybd">Is It a &#8220;Capital Asset&#8221; or a Hedge for Business?</span><br>
        Before Congress passed IRC Section 1256 legislation in the 1980s, all 
        securities and commodities were subject to tax laws for &#8220;capital 
        assets&#8221; versus ordinary business transactions. Traders and investors 
        purchased securities as &#8220;capital assets&#8221; to potentially generate 
        a gain from speculation, rather than as part of a business operation. 
        Similarly, a trader speculated in corn futures without any commercial 
        interest in the commodity, and generated more tax-favorable &#8220;capital&#8221; 
        gain and loss treatment. But the corn farmer who hedged his crop with 
        corn futures did it as part of his business&#8217;s risk-aversion strategy, 
        and generated &#8220;ordinary&#8221; gain or loss treatment.<br>
        <br>
        Unless an item is defined in IRC Section 1256, IRC Section 988 (the currency 
        rules stated later in the article) or another code section, it is subject 
        to the general rules for &#8220;capital assets.&#8221; <br>
        <br>
        <span class="copybd">Congress Rewards Long-Term Investments In &#8220;Capital Assets&#8221; 
        (Securities)</span><br>
        The tax rules for businesses are fairly straightforward. Add up revenues, 
        deduct all business expenses, and the resulting net profit is taxed at 
        ordinary income tax rates.<br>
        <br>
        Ordinary tax rates are high, but at least a business can deduct every 
        possible business expense without restriction.<br>
        <br>
        Congress passed a complex body of rules for investment activity, and these 
        rules have not aged well. Here&#8217;s the bargain: Hold a &#8220;capital 
        asset&#8221; long enough (currently 12 months), and pay a lower tax rate 
        &#8211; currently 15 versus 35 percent &#8211; a significant difference 
        per the 2003 Tax Act. But fiscal policy usually comes with both a carrot 
        and a stick. To balance the budget on lower long-term capital gains rates, 
        Congress applies a series of rules to prevent abuses and to raise revenue.</p>
      <p><span class="copybd">Don&#8217;t Let Congress Wash Your Savings Away With &#8220;Wash Sale&#8221; 
        Rules</span><br>
        Congress used MTM for Section 1256 to stop traders from avoiding taxes 
        by reporting loss positions and deferring offsetting profitable positions. 
        The original tax rule to stop a similar type of practice is still on the 
        books, and it&#8217;s a royal pain for active securities traders &#8211; 
        the wash sale rules.<br>
        <br>
        If you re-enter a losing positions within 30 days before or after selling 
        a losing position, you are hit with the dreaded wash sale loss deferral 
        rule. These rules are highly complex and beyond the scope of this article. 
        But, bottom line, if you trade commodities and futures (IRC section 1256 
        contracts) or elect IRC 475 (the new mark-to-market accounting rules for 
        business traders), you are exempt from the wash sale rules. What a relief! 
        Congress thinks the wash sale rules are fair because they don&#8217;t 
        want traders taking short-term losses (at the higher tax rate for benefits) 
        and then paying taxes later on at the lower long-term rates. </p>
      <p><span class="copybd">Have a Loss? Good Luck Trying to Deduct It.</span><br>
        The greatest problem for traders is the dreaded &#8220;capital loss limitation&#8221; 
        rules. It&#8217;s a puny net deduction on capital losses of $3,000 per 
        year for individuals (zero for corporations), and it has not been indexed 
        for inflation or raised in decades. Come on! Please! What trader can&#8217;t 
        lose $3,000 in one hour&#8217;s time, let alone over a year?</p>
      <p>Congress changed the laws in 1997 for those who qualify as business traders 
        to allow ordinary gain or loss treatment like other businesses. If you 
        elect IRC Section 475 on time, you are exempt from the dreaded capital 
        loss limitation (and wash sale) rules and may take unrestricted ordinary 
        deductions for your trading losses. But not every trader qualifies for 
        business treatment, and most don&#8217;t know about MTM IRC 475 before 
        it&#8217;s too late.</p>
      <p>Commodity and futures traders catch another break. They are permitted 
        to carry back IRC Section 1256 contract trading losses three tax years, 
        but only to be applied against Section 1256 contract trading gains. </p>
      <p>Capital loss limitations are an abomination for traders. Most traders 
        do not hold positions for more then a month, and most day- or swing-trade. 
        They have no reasonable prospect of ever getting that carrot &#8211; long- 
        term capital gains benefits &#8211; so why penalize them with wash sales 
        and capital loss limitations?</p>
      <p><span class="copybd">Is It a Security or a Commodity? That Is the Question</span><br>
        There has been a bevy of new financial products launched by securities 
        and commodities exchanges the past few years, including but not limited 
        to ETFs, E-minis, single-stock futures, plenty of new indices, and options 
        and futures on almost everything. Commodity futures exchanges rushed to 
        market securities-like products to mimic the trading in indexes rather 
        then miss the equities bubble boom. And electronic exchanges like OneChicago, 
        LLC, and NQLX offered securities futures contracts (single stock futures) 
        and ETF futures. Competing exchanges stepped on each other&#8217;s turf. 
        <br>
        <br>
        But, product names are not indicative of tax treatment and are intended 
        to draw attention and use by traders. Before starting to trade a new product, 
        find out how it&#8217;s taxed &#8211; as a security or a commodity.</p>
      <p><span class="copybd">Single Stock Futures &#8211; Security or Commodity?</span><br>
        One of the new financial products to trade are &#8220;single stock futures&#8221; 
        (SSF). Many traders and professionals alike are still confused about how 
        they are taxed. Single stock futures, called &#8220;securities futures 
        contracts&#8221; by the IRS, sound like (and trade like) a futures product, 
        normally taxed as a commodity. However, SSFs are taxed like securities.<br>
        <br>
        Here's the simplistic rule of thumb. Figure all new products are taxed 
        as either a security or a commodity.</p>
      <p>Next, consider that many new financial products are a combination or 
        representation of other securities and/or commodities. Try to figure out 
        whether the product resembles a security or a commodity. For example, 
        with single stock futures, the product may act like a future, but the 
        underlying product is one security and the SSF product resembles that 
        underlying security. In fact, that is why the IRS states SSFs are taxed 
        like securities.</p>
      <p><span class="copybd">Indexes &#8211; Security or Commodity? It Depends. </span><br>
        Next, apply this same logic to stock indexes. There has been a rash of 
        new stock indexes from various exchanges, providing traders with new means 
        to trade securities markets. To date, most of these new indexes are, in 
        fact, taxed like commodities, but some of the new ones are taxed like 
        securities. New coordinated legislation in 2000 from the IRS, Securities 
        and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
        (CFTC) set the new general rule. <br>
        <br>
        Extending the above logic for SSFs, if the product trades like one or 
        a few securities (the cut-off is set at nine), it is defined as a &#8220;narrow-based&#8221; 
        index and taxed like a security. Conversely, if the index is comprised 
        of ten or more securities, it is considered a &#8220;broad-based&#8221; 
        index that resembles a commodity.</p>
      <p>To date almost all indexes are comprised of ten or more securities, and 
        therefore, are taxed like commodities with the beneficial 60/40 treatment. 
        But a few aren&#8217;t. OneChicago, LLC one of two U.S. futures exchanges 
        originally established to offer single stock futures and related products, 
        last summer introduced 15 futures on the Dow Jones MicroSector Indexes. 
        Each of the 15 is a narrow-based index that includes five of the largest 
        and most actively traded stocks in an industry sector. These narrow-based 
        indexes are taxed like securities. </p>
      <p><span class="copybd">Forget the Rule of Thumb: Give Me a List of Securities, 
        Please</span><br>
        OK, let&#8217;s just break this down to make it easier. Securities include 
        but are not limited to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) including QQQ, DIA and SPDRs; </li>
        <li>Stocks, stock options, mutual funds, and bonds;</li>
        <li> Single stock futures, otherwise known as &#8220;non-dealer securities 
          futures contracts;&#8221;</li>
        <li> By default, any &#8220;capital asset&#8221; that is not otherwise 
          defined as an IRC Section 1256 contract (a commodity) or IRC Section 
          988 (currencies, inter-bank foreign exchange or FOREX). For example, 
          gold bullion sounds like a commodity or currency, but physical gold 
          is neither included in IRC section 1256 or 988, and it&#8217;s taxed 
          like securities. That means if you hold gold bullion bars for more than 
          12 months, you are entitled the lower long-term capital gains rate (currently 
          15 percent).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The taxability on options on ETFs, where the underlying portfolio or 
        index is broad-based, is currently uncertain and requires guidance from 
        the IRS.</p>
      <p><span class="copybd">Which Do I Want to Trade, Security or Commodity?</span><br>
        If you want to buy and hold a product for the long-term and are not worried 
        about large non-deductible capital losses, then the best choice is a security. 
        You can pay taxes at the lower long-term capital gains rates (up to 15 
        percent).</p>
      <p>If you plan on buying and selling in a short period of time &#8211; the 
        focus of most business traders, and want a built-in carry-back loss feature, 
        then the best choice is a Section 1256 contract, which includes most commodities 
        and futures traded on exchanges. You can pay taxes at the lower blended 
        long-term/short-term (60/40) rates up to 23 percent.<br>
        <br>
        If you are a securities business trader, then elect IRC 475 to have mark-to-market 
        accounting on securities. Your trading gains are taxed at the higher ordinary 
        tax rates (up to 35 percent) whether you elect MTM or not. And with MTM, 
        you are exempt from the onerous wash sale loss and capital loss limitation 
        rules. <br>
        <br>
        It is possible to have the best of all worlds. You can trade 1256 contracts 
        for 60/40 treatment, business trade securities with MTM loss protection, 
        and &#8220;segregate&#8221; investments in securities for long-term capital 
        gains with deferral (until you sell).</p>
      <p><span class="copybd">Here&#8217;s the Skinny on Section 1256 Contracts.</span><br>
        Special tax rules apply to IRC section 1256 contracts. By definition, 
        they include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Any regulated futures contract (i.e. commodities and futures contracts 
          on U.S. commodities exchanges;</li>
        <li>Foreign currency contracts (traded on exchanges, but not including 
          FOREX or inter-bank trading; see special rules for IRC 988 below);</li>
        <li>Non-equity options or dealer equity options (i.e. these are the &#8220;broad-based 
          indexes&#8221; discussed above, including but not limited to the NASDAQ 
          100, Dow and S&amp;P futures contracts);</li>
        <li>Any dealer securities contracts (not the same as &#8220;non-dealer&#8221; 
          securities futures contracts &#8211; single stock futures. If you are 
          not a dealer, then it&#8217;s non-dealer and not 1256).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Section 1256 contracts are marked-to-market (MTM) each day and at year-end. 
        This means that you report both realized and unrealized gains and losses. 
        MTM doesn't apply to certain hedging transactions.</p>
      <p>There is a newer and different type of mark-to-market accounting treatment 
        that is part of IRC Section 475; don&#8217;t confuse IRC 475 with IRC 
        1256. In 1997, Congress expanded IRC 475 from covering &#8220;dealers&#8221; 
        only to also covering &#8220;traders in securities and/or commodities.&#8221; 
        IRC 475 converts &#8220;capital&#8221; gains and losses into &#8220;ordinary&#8221; 
        gains and losses. Commodity traders usually skip IRC 475 elections because 
        they want to retain the more favorable 60/40 lower capital gains rates 
        on gains. Securities traders prefer to elect IRC 475 because their gains 
        are already taxed at ordinary tax rates. So why not have ordinary loss 
        treatment (rather than be encumbered with capital loss limitations)? To 
        use IRC 475, a trader first must qualify for &#8220;trader tax status&#8221; 
        (business treatment) and elect IRC 475 on a timely basis (by April 15 
        of the current tax year or within 75 days of inception for &#8220;new 
        taxpayers&#8221;).</p>
      <p>Section 1256 MTM is still considered &#8220;capital gains and losses&#8221; 
        and, in fact, after reporting Section 1256 contracts on Form 6781, the 
        net results are then transferred to Schedule D (Capital Gains and Losses). 
        So, you are subject to the $3,000 capital loss limitation, although you 
        benefit from 60/40 tax treatment (the lower blended rate of 23%).</p>
      <p>Many traders overlook a built-in loss carry-back feature in Section 1256. 
        You can carry 1256 contract losses back three tax years, but only against 
        Section 1256 gains in those years. This loss carry-back feature is narrower 
        then the net operating loss carry-back benefit opportunities caused by 
        ordinary loss treatment in IRC 475 MTM (for business traders only). Net 
        operating losses can offset any type of income in the prior two tax years 
        (Congress may extend to five-year carry-backs).<br>
        <br>
        <span class="copybd">Now I&#8217;m Confused. Which MTM Is Right for Me?</span><br>
        All traders in Section 1256 contracts automatically use MTM. That&#8217;s 
        the only way your brokers will report this activity to you. </p>
      <p>When it comes to securities, all investors and business traders use the 
        &#8220;cash method&#8221; by default. Business traders are entitled to 
        elect the new MTM IRC Section 475 that converts restricted capital losses 
        (and gains) into unlimited ordinary losses (and gains). </p>
      <p>Profitable Section 1256 contract traders should not elect IRC 475 MTM 
        to trump their Section 1256 MTM; that would raise their tax rate by 12 
        percent on gains and result in a better loss potential (but for most it&#8217;s 
        not worth the added tax rate). </p>
      <p>If you trade ETFs, single stock futures and narrow-based indexes and 
        qualify for trader tax status (business treatment), then IRC 475 MTM is 
        a good election (so make sure to elect it on time by April 15th of the 
        current tax year, or within 75 days of inception for &#8220;new taxpayers&#8221;). 
        Gains are taxed at the same ordinary tax rates, but with MTM, you unlock 
        unlimited ordinary loss potential (for immediate tax refunds, rather then 
        deferred unutilized capital losses).</p>
      <p><span class="copybd">Skip It &#8211; Let My Broker Tell Me What I Made 
        and How to Report It </span><br>
        Well, that may be fine for Section 1256 contracts, but not for securities 
        and currencies. </p>
      <p>Around February, your broker mails you (with a copy to the IRS) a Form 
        1099-B, which reports some of your brokerage firm activity for the year. 
        Actually, most brokers only report the minimum information required by 
        IRS law.</p>
      <p>Here&#8217;s the bottom line. You cannot prepare your tax returns based 
        on Form 1099s, but will have more luck with Supplemental Information provided 
        by your broker. If you have lots of transactions or use a direct-access 
        or online broker, you also will need more help. <br>
        Accounting software programs can help a lot. GTT TradeLog from this writer&#8217;s 
        company was positively reviewed by the media, and it&#8217;s considered 
        a robust product for active traders.</p>
      <p>Here are a few other things you need to know about the limitations of 
        Form 1099-B:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Currently may omit single stock futures; </li>
        <li>Only report proceeds on sales of securities, not purchases, and they 
          do not match buys with sells; </li>
        <li>Does not report option proceeds or purchases, although most Supplemental 
          Information pages do;</li>
        <li> Does not account for wash sales or MTM on securities;</li>
        <li> Does not account for FOREX trading;</li>
        <li> Are based on &#8220;trade date,&#8221; but monthly statements showing 
          opening and closing positions (needed for accounting), are based on 
          &#8220;settlement date.&#8221;</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Remember, the Form 1099-B is an informational statement with bare bones 
        reporting, and it&#8217;s not meant to state what you made or lost with 
        a brokerage firm. It&#8217;s not like other 1099s (Misc or R) or a Form 
        K-1 or W-2, all of which do report your actual income or loss. </p>
      <p>Many brokers have online reports, but often there are unmatched trades 
        and there&#8217;s no account of wash sales and/or MTM. </p>
      <p>If you don&#8217;t properly report your income to the IRS, you are subject 
        to penalties and interest, including some large extra penalties for understating 
        your taxes with negligence. Get the help you need early on.</p>

        <span class="copybd">With SSFs, Start Holding Period Early For a Long-Term 
        Capital Gain </span><br>
        A securities futures contract is basically a contract of sale for the 
        future delivery of a single security or a narrow-based security index. 
        If a taxpayer takes deliver on the underlying security, their holding 
        period starts from the date of the original purchase of the securities 
        futures contract. That&#8217;s helpful for achieving a 12-month hold; 
        for a lower long-term capital gains tax rate.</p>
      <p><span class="copybd">Currency Trading &#8211; Special Tax Rules Apply</span><br>
        Currency traders transact regulated futures contracts on regulated commodities 
        exchanges (treated as Section 1256 contracts) or in the non-regulated 
        &quot;interbank&quot; market (a collection of banks giving third-party 
        prices on foreign current contracts (FCC) and other forward contracts). 
        <br>
        <br>
        By default, FOREX or inter-bank trading is not included in Section 1256; 
        rather it&#8217;s subject first to IRC Section 988, which specifies tax 
        treatment for foreign currencies.<br>
        The principal intent of IRC Section 988 is taxation on foreign currency 
        transactions in a taxpayer's normal course of transacting global business. 
        For example, if a manufacturer purchases materials in a foreign country 
        in a foreign currency, then the fluctuation in exchange rates gain or 
        loss should be accounted for pursuant to IRC 988.</p>
      <p>So what&#8217;s IRC 988? Simply, it provides that these fluctuations 
        in exchange rate gains and losses should be treated as ordinary income 
        or loss and reported as interest income or interest expense. IRC 988 considers 
        exchange rate risk in the normal course of business to be like interest. 
      </p>
      <p>When a currency trader uses the interbank market to transact in foreign 
        currency contracts and other forward contracts, he is exposed to foreign 
        exchange rate fluctuations, similar to a manufacturer mentioned above. 
        However, the currency trader looks upon his currency positions as &quot;capital 
        assets&quot; in the normal course of his trading activity (business or 
        investment). The &#8220;capital asset&#8221; rules apply. What this means 
        is that a currency trader may elect out of ordinary gain or loss treatment 
        in IRC section 988, thereby qualifying to use section 1256 contract treatment 
        &#8211; which is 60/40 capital gains and losses. Most currency traders 
        will want to make this election for the tax-beneficial treatment of section 
        1256 (lower tax rates on gains). </p>
      <p>And, those with large FOREX trading losses may be better to skip IRC 
        1256 and take an ordinary tax loss. You need to make the election on a 
        &#8220;contemporaneous basis&#8221; in your own books and records; which 
        means you are not supposed to pick and choose the best approach after-the-fact.</p>
      <p><span class="copybd">Bottom Line </span><br>
        Don&#8217;t let the tail (taxes) wag the dog (trading). Put your trading 
        affairs in tax order. Buy and hold &#8220;segregated&#8221; investment 
        securities for deferred 15-percent tax rates. Trade commodities, futures 
        and broad-based indexes for a lower 23-percent blended tax rate (60/40 
        treatment on IRC Section 1256 contracts). Try to qualify for trader tax 
        status and elect IRC 475 on securities only for added tax loss insurance. 
        If you are not sure, ask your broker and accountant; this will prevent 
        surprises at year-end. There are a number of other differences between 
        all the new products besides taxes (margin, risk, investment sizes, selling 
        features, and more).</p>
