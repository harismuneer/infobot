<br />
It looks like Clinton's campaign is seconds away from collapsing... you should probably say goodbye to Edwards also. <br />
<br />
As for the Republicans?  It's far from over, and it looks like McCain might have a serious advantage now that Romney's lost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obama has a good chance of going all the way to November, but theres still the chance that if he was to win presidency, he could be assassinated due to his race. Yes the racial boundaries are pretty much total history now, but there are still the lingering groups that refuse to see 2 colors instead of 1.<br />
<br />
I could give a **** let about the republican side.<br />
<br />
Im totally independent and I vote for who I believe is the lesser of 2 evils. So it will be interesting to see who is in the lead in the next few months</div></div><hr />

I'm not surprised with the way the voting went in Iowa.  I went to a couple of Obama events in Illinois, and they were hitting Iowa hard with volunteers.  With such close proximity to Illinois, Obama had a very good shot of winning (Which he eventually did).<br />
 <br />
New Hampshire is a very different story though.  If Obama wins NH, then you can kiss the Democratic race goodbye for Edwards, Hillary and the rest of the Democratic candidates.<br />
 <br />
As for the Republican side, I was surprised to see Giuliani lose so much ground.  He should also do a lot better in NH but he's candidacy is all but done with the Iowa results...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I doubt he'll be able to do much better in NH.  He's performing well nationally, but he's in 5-6 place in New Hampshire at the moment... and tonight's results shouldn't help much.</div></div><hr />

I'd love to see Obama knock Hillary out of it.  It's still an uphill climb for him IMHO.  I agree that Edwards is just about done.  If Hillary wins her party's nomination, I think the Dems are doomed.  It's widely believed that they have a major advantage this year and and to me, the best way to flush that down the toilet would be to run Hillary.  Her image is way too damaged to win the swing votes she would need.</div></div><hr />

This is purely ridiculous, as if the 31st (Iowa) and 42nd (New Hampshire) most populated states in the union can accurately provide a &quot;pulse&quot; for the rest of the nation.  Even worse, that the media feels like winning in Iowa &amp; New Hampshire is enough to get voters in other states to swing their vote.<br />

It's not over for any of the candidates until late on February 5th....Super Tuesday, where 20 states hold their primaries.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I don't care much for Giuliani.  However, as I stated earlier Iowa's caucuses and New Hampshire's primaries are an innaccurate gauge of predicting the party's nomination.<br />
<br />
For example, in 1992, Bill Clinton lost both Iowa and New Hampshire, that sure did turn out to be a good indicator of who would win (sarcasm).  In  1996 the primaries were basically irrevalent for the Democrats due to Clinton being the incumbent.  2000 was also basically irrevalent for the Democrats with only Al Gore and Bill Bradley being front runners in the primaries, making Al Gore nearly uncontested for the race.  2004 was the only year since in which John Edwards and John Kerry kept &quot;trading ground&quot;.  Even going back to 1988, Michael Dukakis lost Iowa and won New Hampshire.  <br />
<br />
Just evidence that media hypes the Iowa causus and NH primary too much.</div></div><hr />

I agree that you can't really gauge who the rest of the nation will vote for based on just Iowa and NH.  But what it can do is eliminate some candidates.  I think you have to finish at least in the top 5 possibly top 3 (Depending on the variations between the votes) to still be consider a viable candidate come Super Tuesday.<br />
 <br />
Take the Republican side, just because McCain, Romney, Thompson, or Ron Paul didn't win, they are still in the race.  But Giuliani finished 6th which is going to hurt him a lot...</div></div><hr />

 <br />
Bill Clinton lost Iowa because he was running against a senator from Iowa. Everyone knew Harkin would win his own state (And he did by a large margin). Similar situation in NH although not to the same extent, where Bill lost to Tsongas (Senator from Massachusetts).<br />
 <br />
Clinton came in second in both states though, which validated him as a major player in the democratic race. As I said earlier I don't think Iowa or NH is a good gauge of who will win the nomination but it could eliminate the &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; prior to Super Tuesday...</div></div><hr />

LOLOLOL! haha. The thing is, Oprah did help with the housewives. But, one thing about Obama is most liberals (extreme, moderate, etc) and even some Republicans like him, or at least don't hate him like they do Clinton. He's young, although inexperienced. Before Oprah announced her support for Obama, he was getting popular. People like him. <br />

Unfortunately for Hillary Clinton this is a completely different situation.  In 1992 Bill Clinton was not the frontrunner in his party and he was able to take second in New Hampshire which boosted his campaign.  Hillary on the other hand, is (or was) considered the frontrunner before the Iowa Caucus, and a third place finish has completely devastated her campaign.  Look at what happened to Howard Dean in 2004.  He was winning in all national polls, but a third place finish in Iowa killed his chances of winning.</div></div><hr />

Heck, I consider myself a liberal and I like Huckabee.  I've been saying all along that I'd actually consider voting for him if he went up aginst the souless Clinton politcal machine.  He seems like a very earnest and principled candidate.</div></div><hr />

The Clintons represent the past and I think Hillary is doomed to an early defeat.  That's fine with me.  I think this country has come a long way when an African-American wins a primary -- even Iowa -- and draws support from a broad range of people.  I'm not a Democrat but I respect Barack Obama.  He's not out there like the rest of the Democrats who beat up on President Bush more than they do on terrorists.  He reminds me of JFK, not in policy, but in charisma and speaking ability.  Congratulations to the Democrats on finding someone who is upbeat and positive for once.<br />
<br />
As for the GOP, I am still undecided as to whom I will support.  Besides being a Catholic pro-lifer, I'm also inclined to support someone with prior military experience if for no other reason that it helps when sending troops hither and yon to have &quot;been there&quot; yourself.  Certainly this makes me consider John McCain but I am still undecided.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jmccracky</div><div class="date">01-06-2008, 11:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think sometimes it boils down to who you can trust. Obama just seems genuine and most people see that. Same with Huckabee. Huckabee seems like a person who cares, even if you disagree with the policies he believes in. <br />
<br />
Here is a list of the candidates that I would trust and not trust and some opinions of each-<br />
<br />
Mike Huckabee- Yes. I don't agree with anything he says, but I'd trust this man. <br />
<br />
Mitt Romney- No. Too fake. He makes me puke. <br />
<br />
Rudy G- NO. I used to like him. See Mitt Romney. <br />
<br />
Obama- Yes. He's young and fresh. I'm liking this guy more and more. The one thing I do so whole heartedly disagree with him on is his support for the Patriot Act. The Patriot Act is anti-American philosophy at its finest....or worse. However you look at it. <br />
<br />
Edwards- Maybe? I dunno. His hand gestures and hair are straight out of the school of how to be a politician. Mitt Romney has everything else covered, lol, and possibly better hair. I think Edward's heart is in the right place. I'm just not sure if he could get anything done. He's for poor people. Ya know, poor people are also hard working Americans. You don't have to make a gazillion dollars to be important in our country. <br />
<br />
Hillary- No. I did like Bill though. Don't care what anyone says. He was a phenomenal speaker and fascinating. I, however, do not think that Hillary is the vicious female dog that everyone thinks she is. Anytime a woman with power is strong, she's called and labeled a female dog. A man is labeled a go getter. <br />
 <br />
Ron Paul- Yes. Very trustworthy. I do strongly disagree with some of his views, but like Hear Us Roar has said many times, sometimes you gotta put aside the differences. We're all different. I love his passion and think he's a for real guy. <br />
<br />
Kucinich- Yes. This guy really is nice. That is why I won't vote for him. I hope someday that we can live in a world in which we can all vote for a guy like Doug. Unfortunately, in the world of American politics, nice guys finish last. He is VERY passionate and doesn't seem like a crook. Shoot. I dunno. I agree with about everything he says. I might vote for him after all. <br />
<br />
Fred Thompson- Maybe? Same as Edwards. I don't think he is a bad guy. I also don't think he is presidential material. He's kind of the joke out of the bunch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ohio is a republican state. If every single person votes democratic in Ohio, the electoral college can and 9 times out of 10 will vote republican, because republicans run the electoral college here in Ohio. Same goes for all states. Whatever the party of the electoral college is of your state, thats what it votes regardless of of popular vote.<br />

Oh really?  How did we get a Democrat governor then?  Besides, that's not how the Electoral College works.  Let's go back to why the Electoral College was established in the first place.  It exists to spread the vote evenly among the states and the population as a whole.  Without the Electoral College, the winners would be chosen from New York City, Boston, and Philadelphia which were the biggest US population centers at the time of our first elections.</div></div><hr />

We can have a democratic governor, but when it comes to elections, this state votes republican. Because our elected electoral college members are republican. And as long as they stay republican, a republican gets our vote.<br />
<br />
Also depends on whos related to who in what states gets the votes. Dang Bush family</div></div><hr />

<br />
When it comes to elections the state votes Republican?  I really don't see where you're getting this from.  Clinton won it twice in 1992 and 1996, Carter won it in 1976, and Lyndon Johnson won it in 1964. Sure it voted for Bush twice in 2000 and 2004 but they were both by margins of less than 4 percent.  There's a reason why they call it a &quot;swing state.&quot;<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is, Ohio is trending Democrat and there's a significant chance it'll vote that way in 2008.  Corruption has decimated the GOP in the state, and it showed when we elected a Democratic Senator and Governor two years ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ohio is not a Republican state.  It's what many pundits like to call a &quot;purple&quot; state.  There's generally an even number of Democratic and Republican voters, with a large independent block.  Republicans also do not run the electoral college in Ohio.   I'm not sure you're fully understanding how our system works.  We elect a new slate of electors every year that are pledged to a particular candidate.  If the state votes Democrat then the Democrats will get their own group of electoral voters, if the GOP wins Ohio then the opposite occurs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even though he is a democrat I think he can relate to most of the Republicans. <br />
<br />
Biden for president.<br />
<br />
He dropped out of the race.</div></div><hr />

The popular vote does matter.... Popular vote in a particular state is what determines the voting power of that state's delegates to the Electoral College.<br />
<br />
I.E.:  Ohio has 20 Electors, those electors get there by means of whichever candidate wins the state.  It's a representative group of the winner of the state. <br />
<br />
You have to keep in mind that we are a Republic, where we elect &quot;X&quot; number of individuals  where &quot;X&quot; equals a portion of the population of a state.  We are not the commonly misconceived Democracy that the majority of Americans assume we are.<br />
<br />
On the Electoral College......Except for 2 times in our 232 year history where we've had 54 presidential elections, making the Electoral College accurate 96.23% of the time. I'm not justifying the Electoral College nor am I condoning it but i will say this.... it's our our system and for the most part it's been right in coinciding with the popular vote to determine the next president</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that about sums it up for me.  I am woefully ignorant of the Republican candidates, I only know that I really don't trust Giuliani. Has nothing to do with his relationships, it's just him. Something about him that I can't define just bothers me.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I was happy to see Obama do so well in Iowa. In part because he's new and different, something that represents a change instead of the status quo, and in part because I never thought I'd live to see a woman or a black man as a serious candidate for President, much less actually be President. But Obama, well, I've been following him for some months, now, watching and reading interviews and learning all I could about him. For me, personally, Obama is the front-runner.<br />
<br />
I don't trust Hillary. It's like Giuliani. There's something indefinable about her that I just don't like, don't believe, don't trust. Not that I think she'd make a poor Chief, I just don't feel comfortable. Bill I loved. I voted for him both times and was glad to do it. I don't know if my mistrust is because, despite my mother's best efforts, I still think a woman shouldn't be as strong as a man, or if it's just her. I hope it's the latter. My mother would crawl out of her grave and slap me silly if it's the former. I'd deserve it.<br />
<br />
Edwards, now, is an interesting one. I agree, his look and actions are textbook perfect, but he doesn't come across as insincere as he appears. Not to me, anyway. And again, he represents a possibility of change. His approach does seem to feed off the (Bill) Clinton &quot;Aw, shucks&quot; ideal, appealing to those who feel like they don't have a voice, the growing lower class. How much he, or any other president for that matter, can actually accomplish, though, I don't know.<br />
<br />
McCain - once again, the only Republican candidate I would seriously consider voting for. <br />
<br />
The rest of the field, I know very little about them. And with my favorite candidate as a front runner for now, including in the polls in New Hampshire, I'm not going to worry too much about them. I think, however, I need to learn a bit more about Huckabee.<br />
<br />
This is going to be an interesting election. <br />
 <br />
Ron Paul lost my confidence when I saw him on Meet the Press. I'm well aware of what it's like to misrepresent yourself, to not present the best picture. I'm dyslexic. It affects more than just reading. But the way he looked on that show, well, frankly, he looked like an idiot. Worse than Bush on his worst day. And I ain't no Bush fan.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps before you start on conspiracy theories and buy a remote cabin in Wyoming, it would be a good idea to review this site:<br />
US Electoral College (http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong.  It's actually happened four times. <br />
<br />
Election of 1824: Andrew Jackson wins popular vote but still loses.<br />
Election of 1876: Samuel Tilden wins popular vote by moderate margin but loses electoral college by one.<br />
Election of 1888: Grover Cleveland loses his reelection bid, but wins the popular vote.<br />
Election of 2000: Al Gore wins the popular vote, but loses the electoral college due to SCOTUS intervention.<br />
<br />
Personally I think it's high time we abolish the electoral college.  It was created because the founding fathers were worried we wouldn't know enough about a candidate before we elected him.  With the spread of cable news and the quick transfer of information, I think it's safe to say Americans will probably be informed enough to not elect a tyrant....<br />
<br />
Of course I could be wrong... we elected Bush after all.<br />
<br />
<br />
A lot of states are considering amending their state constitutions regarding the electoral college.  Their electoral votes will be awarded to the candidate that wins the popular vote at a national level.</div></div><hr />
