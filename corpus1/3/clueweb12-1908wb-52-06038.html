<p>A better approach would be for the government to provide capital directly, in the form of a "super-bond," in an amount no greater than the debt to bondholders. The "super-bond" would be subordinate to customer liabilities, so it could be counted as capital for the purpose of capital requirements, and would be seen by customers as a legitimate cushion of protection. However, in the event of bankruptcy, it would have a senior claim in front of both stockholders and even senior bondholders. Do that, and you've actually got a mechanism to protect the financial system while at the same time protecting customers and taxpayers. Ideally, the super-bond accrues a relatively high rate of interest so that financials have an incentive to shift to private financing as soon as possible, but you would also defer the interest until the bank meets a minimal level of profitability to make sure that the financing doesn't strain the institution's liquidity. </p></blockquote></div><div class="vine-p p-content_TagList"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/business" rel="tag">business</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/us" rel="tag">us</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/bonds" rel="tag">bonds</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/economy" rel="tag">economy</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/wall-street" rel="tag">wall-street</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/economics" rel="tag">economics</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/banks" rel="tag">banks</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/finance" rel="tag">finance</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/us-news" rel="tag">us-news</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/bailout" rel="tag">bailout</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/assets" rel="tag">assets</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/bank-failures" rel="tag">bank-failures</a></div><div class="vine-p p-content_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22contentId%22%3A%221940722%22%2C%22headline%22%3A%22+You+Can%27t+Rescue+the+Financial+System+If+You+Can%27t+Read+a+Balance+Sheet+%22%2C%22authorDomain%22%3A%22200MilesUp%22%7D"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><span class="numCount">2</span><span class="label">votes</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_uparrow_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Vote for this story to help push it up the Vine." /></span></li><li class="box comments"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2008/10/01/1940722-you-cant-rescue-the-financial-system-if-you-cant-read-a-balance-sheet#comments" title="View Comments">0<span class="label"> comments</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_comment_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Comments" title="Comments" /></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="clearer"><span></span></div></li><li class="vine-contentList-item-1899753"><img src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=http3A2F2Fwww.newsvine.com2F_vine2Fimages2Fav2F120x1202F200MilesUp-1410636418.jpg&width=30" width="30" height="30" alt="" class="post_avatar" /><div class="headline"><a class="icon" href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=09&amp;year=2008&amp;base_name=the_five_worst_problems_with_t" title="Direct Link To Story"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/extlink_16.gif" alt="Direct Link To Story" width="16" height="16" /></a><h1><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2008/09/23/1899753-the-five-worst-problems-with-the-bailout-bill">The Five Worst Problems With The Bailout Bill. </a></h1></div><div class="dateline">Seeded on Tue Sep 23, 2008 8:31 AM EDT (prospect.org)</div><div class="teaser"><blockquote><p>And the Foreclosure Crisis? The financial crisis is one symptom of the foreclosure crisis. The bad assets are largely bad mortgages, and when they go bad, it means Wall Street loses some money, yes, but it also means a family loses their home. And though ensuring Wall Street's survival is a definite priority, it's extremely hard to argue that elite investors who made bad bets in order to reap big profits deserve public help while ordinary homeowners who entered into bad mortgages on the strength of bad advice merit nothing. The terms of this bailout, however, actually make it easier to imagine a policy that could aid these folks. As Dean Baker says, "The government will inevitably come into the possession of a vast amount of mortgages in various stages of delinquency. The priority in these cases should be to allow people to remain in their homes, not maximizing the return on the mortgages. This should mean first a good faith effort to negotiate a write-down that makes it possible for homeowners to remain in their house as owners. If this proves impossible, then the next recourse should be to give homeowners the option to remain as renters paying the market rent for the house. Only if the homeowner can neither arrange a new mortgage nor pay the market should the government move ahead with foreclosure procedures." For the government to protect Wall Street by buying these mortgages but abandon Main Street once it owns them would be obscene.</p></blockquote></div><div class="vine-p p-content_TagList"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/business" rel="tag">business</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/us" rel="tag">us</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/wall-street" rel="tag">wall-street</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/fed" rel="tag">fed</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/economics" rel="tag">economics</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/us-treasury" rel="tag">us-treasury</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/bailout" rel="tag">bailout</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/foreclosures" rel="tag">foreclosures</a></div><div class="vine-p p-content_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22contentId%22%3A%221899753%22%2C%22headline%22%3A%22The+Five+Worst+Problems+With+The+Bailout+Bill.+%22%2C%22authorDomain%22%3A%22200MilesUp%22%7D"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><span class="numCount">3</span><span class="label">votes</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_uparrow_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Vote for this story to help push it up the Vine." /></span></li><li class="box comments"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2008/09/23/1899753-the-five-worst-problems-with-the-bailout-bill#comments" title="View Comments">2<span class="label"> comments</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_comment_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Comments" title="Comments" /></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="clearer"><span></span></div></li><li class="vine-contentList-item-1498501"><img src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=http3A2F2Fwww.newsvine.com2F_vine2Fimages2Fav2F120x1202F200MilesUp-1410636418.jpg&width=30" width="30" height="30" alt="" class="post_avatar" /><div class="headline"><a class="icon" href="http://www.economist.com/opinion/displayStory.cfm?Story_ID=11376185" title="Direct Link To Story"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/ico/92.gif" alt="Direct Link To Story" width="16" height="16" /></a><h1><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2008/05/19/1498501-is-international-financial-system-fundamentally-flawed">Is International Financial System fundamentally flawed?</a></h1></div><div class="dateline">Seeded on Mon May 19, 2008 10:59 AM EDT (The Economist)</div><div class="teaser"><blockquote><p>The second, deeper question is whether a market-based approach to finance is efficient.

The Bombay Sensitive Index or Sensex dove 1716.41 points (9.75%) within sixty seconds and trading was halted for an hour. In less than 60 seconds Rupees 3,000,000,000,000 ($76 billion)of investors' wealth vanished. People panicked and many crowded the Dalal Street, Bombay Stock Exchange's address; shell shocked investors helplessly looked at the electronic displays outside the exchange while others demanded that the statue of the bull outside the exchange's entrance be removed.    </p>
<p>The Finance Minister assured that there was "no reason to allow the worries of western world to ovewhelm us, our economy is very strong". He added that adding liquidity in the system wasn't an issue. Some major banks confirmed that the Finance Ministry has 'advised' them to help brokers square-off the margins, the Finance Ministry also directed the big insurance companies like Life Insurance of India & state-owned banks to buy frontline stocks so as to stop the market from plunging further. </p>
<p>At 12:11pm the market was trading 1946 points below its previous close, some stocks had corrected by as much as 45%. The stocks went into the recovery mode at around 12:36pm, from then on the market traded in a highly volatile manner ending the session at 3:30pm down 875 points. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, an investor in the state of Gujarat died of heart attack after he lost Rupees 300,000 ($7,600); it may not sound a big amount but it is big for those who invest in the market after saving whatever they can from their monthly incomes. Many astrologers are giving advises that the face of the bull (outside the Exchange building) be turned towards the right side; they say that would bring recovery & new highs in the market. </p>
<p>Although Indian markets aren't alone in the global equity mayhem but no stock market has plunged like the BSE has. I suffered a 40% decline in profits in two days & it that didn't help me concentrate in the class, I just kept checking the Index level while my professors took the lectures. I was hoping that i could raise some money so as to partly finance my post graduate studies but I guess it would be very tough now. But like almost every other investor I too, haven't lost hope - everybody including me feels that the fundamentals of the Indian economy are very strong (it's  growing at 8.9%). </p></div><p

post 7.1 percent growth, slightly off their 2007 performance of 7.4 percent but still a continuation of a four-year streak of record expansion.</p>
<p>By contrast, the bank anticipated a lacklustre 2.2 percent from high-income countries and 1.9 percent from the U.S. economy, the world's biggest.</p>
<p>These predictions could prove rosy if the United States ends up taking other economies -- including developing ones -- down with it, the bank said in its Global Economic Prospects report for 2008.</p>
<p>A weaker U.S. dollar, the spectre of recession, and rising financial-market volatility could cast a shadow over this soft landing scenario for the global economy, it said.</p>
<p>These risks would cut export revenues and capital inflows for developing countries and reduce the value of their dollar investments abroad. If this happened, developing countries might have to draw down the reserves and other buffers they have built up in recent years.</p>
<p>"Overall, we expect developing-country growth to moderate only somewhat over the next two years. However, a much sharper United States slowdown is a real risk that could weaken medium-term prospects in developing countries," said Uri Dadush, the bank's director of development prospects. </p></blockquote></div><div class="vine-p p-content_TagList"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/business" rel="tag">business</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/world" rel="tag">world</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/economics" rel="tag">economics</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/growth" rel="tag">growth</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/developing-countries" rel="tag">developing-countries</a></div><div class="vine-p p-content_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22contentId%22%3A%221218091%22%2C%22headline%22%3A%22ECONOMY%3A+Global+Prospects+Pinned+on+Developing+World%22%2C%22authorDomain%22%3A%22200MilesUp%22%7D"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><span class="numCount">1</span><span class="label">vote</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_uparrow_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Vote for this story to help push it up the Vine." /></span></li><li class="box comments"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2008/01/10/1218091-economy-global-prospects-pinned-on-developing-world#comments" title="View Comments">0<span class="label"> comments</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_comment_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Comments" title="Comments" /></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="clearer"><span></span></div></li><li class="vine-contentList-item-1177623"><img src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=http3A2F2Fwww.newsvine.com2F_vine2Fimages2Fav2F120x1202F200MilesUp-1410636418.jpg&width=30" width="30" height="30" alt="" class="post_avatar" /><div class="headline"><a class="icon" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2007/TECH/biztech/12/20/digital.design/index.html?eref=rss_latest" title="Direct Link To Story"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/ico/56.gif" alt="Direct Link To Story" width="16" height="16" /></a><h1><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/12/20/1177623-businesses-have-designs-for-the-poor">Businesses have designs for the poor </a></h1></div><div class="dateline">Seeded on Thu Dec 20, 2007 6:18 PM EST (CNN)</div><div class="teaser"><blockquote><p>Meanwhile, a pioneer of pro-poor technologies is behind a new organization that will churn out even more ideas. Paul Polak, who started International Development Enterprises (www.ideorg.org) about 25 years ago to aid the rural poor, helped launch a new organization called D-Rev a few months ago. D-Rev is keeping a low profile to ensure a smooth take-off.</p>
<p>A non-profit organization, IDE gained recognition for encouraging the use of water treadle pumps in Asia and Africa. The pumps are made of basic materials readily available in remote areas, but reminiscent of StairMasters in that stepping motions are used to draw up groundwater for watering crops (http://other90.cooperhewitt.org/Design/bamboo-treadle-pump).</p>
<p>Other IDE projects include dirt-cheap ceramic water filters and simple but effective irrigation systems. The idea with each project is to "activate the markets" so that small local merchants have a profit-motive to sell such technologies to poor farmers in their area.</p>
<p>D-Rev, the new organization, will encourage the design of more products for low-income people, but not only for the rural poor. The organization is keeping mum on many details, but one of its projects is a "one-horse micro-diesel engine, which will do for mechanization at the village what the Prius did for the motor car," Polak said.</p>
<p>Another is an electro-chlorinator approach to purifying drinking water in the slums.</p>
<p>"One of the problems with slums is a lot of times they don't have access to a water supply, or they tap into the city water, which really makes you sick because it's got pathogens," Polak said. "I think we can do a low-cost kiosk that'll set up a slum entrepreneur on a franchise basis with $300 in capital costs that'll produce 5,000 liters of drinkable water a day." Imagine 10,000 such kiosks, he added, and you've got a big business.</p>

<p>According to the Empowered Newswire, a US-based Nigerian news agency, Ezekwesili, in an email exchange, said the anomaly was detected by the Federal Government during an audit of the oil sector conducted by the Nigerian Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.</p>

<p>Ezekwesili, who was the former Minister of Education, disclosed that "when the Federal Government asked the oil companies about the money, their reply was that nobody asked."</p>
<p>She, however, added that the oil firms had since paid the money in full to the coffers of the Federal Government.</p>

Siemens is alleged to have artificially driven up the costs for the construction of a power plant completed in the Punjab region of Pakistan during the late 1990s. The result may have been several millions worth of inflated World Bank subsidies for the project.</p></blockquote></div><div class="vine-p p-content_TagList"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/business" rel="tag">business</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/contracts" rel="tag">contracts</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/world-bank" rel="tag">world-bank</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/siemens" rel="tag">siemens</a></div><div class="vine-p p-content_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22contentId%22%3A%22824966%22%2C%22headline%22%3A%22Did+Siemens+Cheat+the+World+Bank%3F%22%2C%22authorDomain%22%3A%22200MilesUp%22%7D"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><span class="numCount">0</span><span class="label">votes</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_uparrow_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Vote for this story to help push it up the Vine." /></span></li><li class="box comments"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/07/08/824966-did-siemens-cheat-the-world-bank#comments" title="View Comments">0<span class="label"> comments</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_comment_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Comments" title="Comments" /></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="clearer"><span></span></div></li><li class="vine-contentList-item-818388"><img src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=http3A2F2Fwww.newsvine.com2F_vine2Fimages2Fav2F120x1202F200MilesUp-1410636418.jpg&width=30" width="30" height="30" alt="" class="post_avatar" /><div class="headline"><a class="icon" href="http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/hot-slovenia-beats-china-as-worlds-top-market/2007/07/04/1183351290819.html" title="Direct Link To Story"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/ico/87.gif" alt="Direct Link To Story" width="16" height="16" /></a><h1><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/07/04/818388-hot-slovenia-beats-china-as-worlds-top-market">Hot Slovenia beats China as world's top market </a></h1></div><div class="dateline">Seeded on Wed Jul 4, 2007 3:22 PM EDT (The Age)</div><div class="teaser"><blockquote><p>SLOVENIA'S share rally has made its equity market more expensive than China's.

<p>The office is still full of paper, but a lot of it hasn't been looked at for years. For example, I have filing cabinets full of photocopied journal articles, and a good indexing system for them, but I hardly ever use them. It's easier to download PDFs for all the articles I want on a topic, and read them onscreen, rather than checking to see if I already have a file copy. And I've hardly added any in the last five years, so it's only inertia that keeps them in place.</p>
<p>There are still a couple of exceptions.

In this case, Flying Dog's Open Source Beer Project will allow beer drinkers and homebrewers to create or recommend modifications to the recipe.</p>
<p>The Open Source Beer Project will start as a Dopplebock but the style may evolve as participants offer ideas and tweak the recipe.  "We are encouraging input on every part of the recipe, down to how what variety of hops we should use, how much we should use and when we should add them," said Flying Dog's Head Brewer, Matt Brophy.<br />
Flying Dog's Director of Marketing, Neal Stewart says that this is a unique way for consumers to participate in the creation of a new beer. "The Open Source Beer is a truly collaborative project and gives our loyal fans the opportunity to buy a beer that they actually played a major role in creating." </p>
<p>The Open Source Beer will be Flying Dog's latest "Wild Dog" release and will hit stores in October.  Wild Dogs are extremely limited edition beers that come exclusively in hand filled, corked and labeled 750ml bottles.  Only 5000 bottles of the Open Source Wild Dogs will be available to the public.  Flying Dog's current Wild Dog is a whiskey barrel-aged version of their popular Gonzo Imperial Porter.</p>

<p>Announcing the launch of the  $150 million Corecap Islamic Private Equity Fund I (CIPEF I), Al Thani said the fund will eye Shariah-compliant Private Equity investments in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region through equity participation and Shariah-compliant mezzanine structure.</p>
<p>The fund will acquire majority stakes in stable and mature businesses through funding growth capital, MBOs, MBIs, LBOs and recapitalisations. As one of its kind, CIPEF I achieves a breakthrough in the sphere of Islamic Finance, making it the first Private Equity fund that offers a Shariah-compliant mezzanine structure worldwide.   This innovative structure overcomes one of the main traditional funding barriers for the growth of the Islamic Private Equity Industry. The announcement was made at the Qatar Economic Forum.</p>
<p>Corecap's solid shareholder base is led and represented on the board by the Chairman Shaikh Mohamed bin Jassem Al Thani, former minister of economy and commerce in Qatar, Vice-Chairman Rohit Walia, CEO and Managing Director of Bank Sarasin-Alpen (ME)  and Alpen Capital (ME), leading Swiss private and investment banks, and by CEO and Board Member Khaled Hassan Rashed and Managing Director Omar Adel El Maghawry both representing CORE PARTNERS, an investment management firm.</p></blockquote></div><div class="vine-p p-content_TagList"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/business" rel="tag">business</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/finance" rel="tag">finance</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/banking" rel="tag">banking</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/growth" rel="tag">growth</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/islam" rel="tag">islam</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/islamic-banking" rel="tag">islamic-banking</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/sharia" rel="tag">sharia</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/riba" rel="tag">riba</a></div><div class="vine-p p-content_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22contentId%22%3A%22732917%22%2C%22headline%22%3A%22+Islamic+finance+industry+grows+at+15-20%25+a+year%22%2C%22authorDomain%22%3A%22200MilesUp%22%7D"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><span class="numCount">0</span><span class="label">votes</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_uparrow_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Vote for this story to help push it up the Vine." /></span></li><li class="box comments"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/05/22/732917-islamic-finance-industry-grows-at-15-20-a-year#comments" title="View Comments">0<span class="label"> comments</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_comment_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Comments" title="Comments" /></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="clearer"><span></span></div></li><li class="vine-contentList-item-727176"><img src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=http3A2F2Fwww.newsvine.com2F_vine2Fimages2Fav2F120x1202F200MilesUp-1410636418.jpg&width=30" width="30" height="30" alt="" class="post_avatar" /><div class="headline"><a class="icon" href="http://www.businessweek.com/autos/content/may2007/bw20070517_870308.htm?campaign_id=rss_topStories" title="Direct Link To Story"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/ico/143.gif" alt="Direct Link To Story" width="16" height="16" /></a><h1><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/05/18/727176-iacocca-daimler-screwed-chrysler">Iacocca: Daimler screwed Chrysler</a></h1></div><div class="dateline">Seeded on Fri May 18, 2007 6:28 PM EDT (Business Week)</div><div class="teaser"><blockquote><p>There's one thing everyone agrees on: Daimler screwed Chrysler royally. To understand how the desperation sale to Cerberus Capital Management could possibly happen to one of America's iconic car companies, you have to look at the history. Chrysler's merger with Daimler-Benz nine years ago was a disaster from the start. At the time, Chrysler was making a lot of money—something like $1 billion every quarter. The minivan was a cash cow. The Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Ram pickup were selling like crazy. There were 4,000 profitable dealers, a brand-new $1.5 billion research center, and $12 billion in cash. Chrysler was the lowest-cost producer and the most profitable car company in the world, with sales of 2.5 million cars and light trucks. But it took Daimler less than a decade to drive Chrysler off a cliff.</p></blockquote></div><div class="vine-p p-content_TagList"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/business" rel="tag">business</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/us" rel="tag">us</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/chrysler" rel="tag">chrysler</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/cars" rel="tag">cars</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/daimler" rel="tag">daimler</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/cerberus-capital-management" rel="tag">cerberus-capital-management</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/lee-iacocca" rel="tag">lee-iacocca</a></div><div class="vine-p p-content_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22contentId%22%3A%22727176%22%2C%22headline%22%3A%22Iacocca%3A+Daimler+screwed+Chrysler%22%2C%22authorDomain%22%3A%22200MilesUp%22%7D"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><span class="numCount">3</span><span class="label">votes</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_uparrow_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Vote for this story to help push it up the Vine." /></span></li><li class="box comments"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/05/18/727176-iacocca-daimler-screwed-chrysler#comments" title="View Comments">1<span class="label"> comment</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_comment_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Comments" title="Comments" /></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="clearer"><span></span></div></li><li class="vine-contentList-item-727080"><img src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=http3A2F2Fwww.newsvine.com2F_vine2Fimages2Fav2F120x1202F200MilesUp-1410636418.jpg&width=30" width="30" height="30" alt="" class="post_avatar" /><div class="headline"><a class="icon" href="http://www.smh.com.au/news/technology/internets-free-world-attracts-dark-forces/2007/05/18/1178995408868.html" title="Direct Link To Story"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/ico/101.gif" alt="Direct Link To Story" width="16" height="16" /></a><h1><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/05/18/727080-2nd-life-internets-free-world-attracts-dark-forces">2nd Life: Internet's free world attracts dark forces </a></h1></div><div class="dateline">Seeded on Fri May 18, 2007 5:58 PM EDT (The Sydney Morning Herald)</div><div class="teaser"><blockquote><p>IT IS a land of 6 million citizens with no police force, courts or taxes.

Few industries could be less flighty than Buddhist temple construction. The belief system has survived for thousands of years and has many millions of adherents. With this firm foundation, Kongo had survived some tumultuous times, notably the 19th century Meiji restoration when it lost government subsidies and began building commercial buildings for the first time. But temple construction had until recently been a reliable mainstay, contributing 80% of Kongo Gumi's $67.6 million in 2004 revenues.</p></blockquote></div><div class="vine-p p-content_TagList"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/business" rel="tag">business</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/japan" rel="tag">japan</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/bankruptcy" rel="tag">bankruptcy</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/kongo-gumi" rel="tag">kongo-gumi</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/temple-building" rel="tag">temple-building</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/family-businesses" rel="tag">family-businesses</a></div><div class="vine-p p-content_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22contentId%22%3A%22709588%22%2C%22headline%22%3A%22The+End+of+a+1%2C400-Year-Old+Business%22%2C%22authorDomain%22%3A%22200MilesUp%22%7D"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><span class="numCount">1</span><span class="label">vote</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_uparrow_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Vote for this story to help push it up the Vine." /></span></li><li class="box comments"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/05/09/709588-the-end-of-a-1400-year-old-business#comments" title="View Comments">0<span class="label"> comments</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_comment_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Comments" title="Comments" /></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="clearer"><span></span></div></li><li class="vine-contentList-item-709549"><img src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=http3A2F2Fwww.newsvine.com2F_vine2Fimages2Fav2F120x1202F200MilesUp-1410636418.jpg&width=30" width="30" height="30" alt="" class="post_avatar" /><div class="headline"><a class="icon" href="http://business.guardian.co.uk/story/0,,2075788,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=1" title="Direct Link To Story"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/ico/103.gif" alt="Direct Link To Story" width="16" height="16" /></a><h1><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/05/09/709549-ryanair-declares-price-war">Ryanair declares price war</a></h1></div><div class="dateline">Seeded on Wed May 9, 2007 3:52 PM EDT (Guardian Unlimited)</div><div class="teaser"><blockquote><p>Ryanair declared a "price war" today against its no-frills rivals such as easyJet as it slashed fares to fill seats when passenger numbers are falling.</p>

As Paul Samuelson once wrote, "According to legend, economists are supposed never to agree among themselves. If Parliament were to ask six economists for an opinion, seven answers would come back — two, no doubt, from the volatile Mr. Keynes!" In fact, economists' image problem goes deeper. Even as individuals, economists have a bad reputation for failing to reach any definite conclusions; hence Harry Truman's famous wish for a "one-handed economist" who could not say "on the one hand … on the other hand."</p>
<p>Hard as it is to believe, though, neither reputation is accurate. As I show in my new book, The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies, the best survey data indicate that economists converge on a long list of unpopular positions. Compared to the general public, economists think that markets work very well, that economic interaction with foreigners makes us better off, that saving labor is a good idea, and that the economy is doing well and getting better.</p>
<p>While detractors of the economics profession often attribute these contrarian views to economists' privileged lifestyle and "right-wing" outlook, the data say otherwise. The typical economist has a high income and a lot of job security, but still sharply disagrees with equally well-off non-economists. Furthermore, despite the "right-wing" reputation, the typical economist is a moderate Democrat. He just happens to be a moderate Democrat who thinks that supply-and-demand governs prices, welcomes foreign competition, and sees the upside of downsizing.</p></blockquote></div><div class="vine-p p-content_TagList"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/business" rel="tag">business</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/economics" rel="tag">economics</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/economists" rel="tag">economists</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/samuelson" rel="tag">samuelson</a></div><div class="vine-p p-content_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22contentId%22%3A%22707767%22%2C%22headline%22%3A%22Economists+Agree%3F%21+%22%2C%22authorDomain%22%3A%22200MilesUp%22%7D"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><span class="numCount">1</span><span class="label">vote</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_uparrow_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Vote for this story to help push it up the Vine." /></span></li><li class="box comments"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/05/08/707767-economists-agree#comments" title="View Comments">0<span class="label"> comments</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_comment_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Comments" title="Comments" /></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="clearer"><span></span></div></li><li class="vine-contentList-item-706427"><img src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=http3A2F2Fwww.newsvine.com2F_vine2Fimages2Fav2F120x1202F200MilesUp-1410636418.jpg&width=30" width="30" height="30" alt="" class="post_avatar" /><div class="headline"><a class="icon" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&amp;refer=columnist_currier&amp;sid=aSBzp8lBznWg" title="Direct Link To Story"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/ico/564.gif" alt="Direct Link To Story" width="16" height="16" /></a><h1><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/05/08/706427-us-savers-discover-they-cant-do-anything-right">U.S. Savers Discover They Can't Do Anything Right</a></h1></div><div class="dateline">Seeded on Tue May 8, 2007 4:56 AM EDT (Bloomberg.com)</div><div class="teaser"><blockquote><p>Brennan concludes: ``There's no need to lead an ascetic lifestyle, but a sober-minded assessment suggests that `over- saving' is pretty low on the list of things to worry about. As economists would say, the risks are asymmetric: Over-saving may impose unnecessary (but probably manageable) hardships, while under-saving can put you in a very tough spot when you're least able to respond.''</p>
<p>The intriguing thing to me in this whole debate, and indeed in most of the talk I encounter about saving, is what seldom gets mentioned: the virtue of saving money for its own sake.</p>
<p>Practically all public-policy incentives to saving pin a specific objective on it -- retirement, most commonly, but also such things as paying for children's college tuition. The whole notion of a ``savings account'' is commonly defined as an emergency reserve against some unexpected ``rainy day,'' such as the loss of your job.</p>
<p>All this shies away from the elemental point that saving a dollar or a yen or a euro, just on general principle, is more often than not the best thing you can do with that money when it comes into your hands.</p></blockquote></div><div class="vine-p p-content_TagList"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/business" rel="tag">business</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/us" rel="tag">us</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/savings" rel="tag">savings</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/economics" rel="tag">economics</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/investment" rel="tag">investment</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/net-worth" rel="tag">net-worth</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/contrarian-view" rel="tag">contrarian-view</a></div><div class="vine-p p-content_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22contentId%22%3A%22706427%22%2C%22headline%22%3A%22U.S.+Savers+Discover+They+Can%27t+Do+Anything+Right%22%2C%22authorDomain%22%3A%22200MilesUp%22%7D"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><span class="numCount">6</span><span class="label">votes</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_uparrow_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Vote for this story to help push it up the Vine." /></span></li><li class="box comments"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/05/08/706427-us-savers-discover-they-cant-do-anything-right#comments" title="View Comments">5<span class="label"> comments</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_comment_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Comments" title="Comments" /></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="clearer"><span></span></div></li><li class="vine-contentList-item-703357"><img src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=http3A2F2Fwww.newsvine.com2F_vine2Fimages2Fav2F120x1202F200MilesUp-1410636418.jpg&width=30" width="30" height="30" alt="" class="post_avatar" /><div class="headline"><a class="icon" href="http://www.dubai-world.net/?p=156" title="Direct Link To Story"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/extlink_16.gif" alt="Direct Link To Story" width="16" height="16" /></a><h1><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/05/06/703357-dubai-to-have-worlds-biggest-retail-zone"> Dubai to have world's biggest retail zone</a></h1></div><div class="dateline">Seeded on Sun May 6, 2007 9:51 AM EDT (dubai-world.net)</div><div class="teaser"><blockquote><p>Dubai: Dubai will create the world's largest shopping area, providing 17 times more retail space than Mall of the Emirates, currently the biggest shopping mall in the city.<br />

<p>But domestic and international observers remain worried that the widespread problems with the election will undermine the legitimacy of the incoming administration.</p>
<p>This has not stopped some investors from committing money, says Christopher Hartland-Peel, African equity analyst at Exotix, a London-based brokerage. Exotix, with a local Nigerian bank, is placing $45m of equity with domestic and international investors for IGI Insurance, the number two insurer by assets.</p>
<p>In addition to an increasing number of equity placements, there have been bond issues by two Nigerian banks, some private equity activity, and a growing number of mergers and acquisitions. Some companies are considering an international stock market listing this year.</p>
<p>Investment banks, including JPMorgan, Citi, Deutsche Bank, Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, and HSBC have recently stepped up their presence in Nigeria and sub-Saharan Africa. Ghana could become the first west African nation to enter the international bond markets with a benchmark sovereign bond issue this year and Botswana and Zambia are also increasingly attracting foreign investor interest.</p>
<p>Along with Nigeria, these three countries have seen "pronounced foreign investor interest in their local currency debt markets", according to a report this month by the International Monetary Fund. Early estimates suggest that in the first half of 2006, Nigeria received portfolio inflows of roughly $1bn, more than five times the total capital flows in 2005.</p></blockquote></div><div class="vine-p p-content_TagList"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/business" rel="tag">business</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/nigeria" rel="tag">nigeria</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/investors" rel="tag">investors</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/africa" rel="tag">africa</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/financial-markets" rel="tag">financial-markets</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/electoral-crisid" rel="tag">electoral-crisid</a></div><div class="vine-p p-content_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22contentId%22%3A%22679196%22%2C%22headline%22%3A%22Even+after+elections%2C+Global+investors+eye+Nigeria%22%2C%22authorDomain%22%3A%22200MilesUp%22%7D"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><span class="numCount">4</span><span class="label">votes</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_uparrow_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Vote for this story to help push it up the Vine." /></span></li><li class="box comments"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/04/23/679196-even-after-elections-global-investors-eye-nigeria#comments" title="View Comments">2<span class="label"> comments</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_comment_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Comments" title="Comments" /></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="clearer"><span></span></div></li><li class="vine-contentList-item-674964"><img src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=http3A2F2Fwww.newsvine.com2F_vine2Fimages2Fav2F120x1202F200MilesUp-1410636418.jpg&width=30" width="30" height="30" alt="" class="post_avatar" /><div class="headline"><a class="icon" href="http://www.javno.com/en/world/clanak.php?id=37063" title="Direct Link To Story"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/extlink_16.gif" alt="Direct Link To Story" width="16" height="16" /></a><h1><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/04/20/674964-nigeria-rating-safe-for-now-despite-election-worry">Nigeria Rating Safe for now Despite Election Worry</a></h1></div><div class="dateline">Seeded on Fri Apr 20, 2007 5:38 PM EDT (javno.com)</div><div class="teaser"><blockquote><p>Nigeria's turbulent election set for the weekend should not affect the country's credit rating, which is backed by strong fiscal policies and oil revenues, a senior Standard & Poor's analyst said on Friday.</p>

When it comes to creating and distributing value, nothing compares to the world of business. Multinationals are very good at business. Multinationals are very good at creating value.</p>
<p>Some say it is a matter of local versus global. People go after Walmart because of its brilliance at keeping costs low and supply chains tight and efficient. Their organisational brilliance becomes destabilising if not destructive when they combine terrible labour contracts with a punctuating effect on local small businesses. McDonald's enters a new market and has negative effects on small inefficient local restaurants. Starbucks got into controversy last year because it would not allow its Ethiopian suppliers to brand their own coffee, as that would be a threat to its excellently cultivated brand.</p>
<p>It does seem that the very things multinationals do very well are the things that put them in conflict with the masses. Multinationals maintain strong focus on developing advanced capabilities in different areas. Those capabilities which they master better than other companies become their advantage. </p>
<p>What are the alternatives? Would Ethiopia be better off if they stopped selling to Starbucks? Of course not. Yet they do lack the market power to buck a multibillion dollar company which has more free cash than a few poor countries. Countries should not be left at the mercy of corporations. On the other hand it is not Ethiopia that is at the mercy of Starbucks it is a group of Ethiopian farmers. Still this massing of power on the Starbucks side would seem to be indicative of the problems with large multinationals.</p>
<p>Walmart is another matter. Its most aggressive stance is in the United States which has a very strong government and a lot of politicians who want to take it on on behalf of the little guy. Nothing seems capable of pulling back Walmart on its grizzly 2000-pound gorilla run through suburban America.</p>
<p>The large corporations might pack some heavy tonnage but the tendency to blame multinationals for poverty is just way off. Pharmaceutical companies are accused of doing nothing to deliver cures to the world's mass killer diseases, and of blocking the adaptation of generic versions of drugs that do offer cures. </p>
<p>A multinational company is a business. Its goal is to make money so it can pay its employees and pay dividends to its shareholders. The world of business is very tough. In mature industries like consumer products margins are very tight. To sustain the organisation and the jobs it carries, costs often have to be aggressively kept low. This sometimes means layoffs and it often means squeezing the smaller companies that supply the big one. The alternative, failure of the multinational and the destruction of shareholders wealth and workers jobs is quite less desirable.</p>
<p>Too many people have unfair ideas about what the role of a multinational is. The biggest elephant is most vulnerable in a hunt. Thus we often find people who take on multinationals just because they can. So many times I go to a small town somewhere and encounter serious environmental damage created by some small company that is nevertheless kept beyond societal and regulatory reproach because its activities are beyond the glare of critical eyes.</p>
<p>The fact is that the big multinationals have higher standards. They pay better salaries, are gentler on the environment, are much more innovative , and do much more to keep the global economy humming than small local companies.</p>
<p>The line of ethics are clearly drawn and multinationals do not have to cross over them. After we witnessed extraordinary misbehaviour by several multinationals in the 1980s and 1990s, a lot of those companies have seen the folly of such ways. Many of them now recognise the need to deliver on the expectations of all stakeholders and not just those of shareholders. Many now genuinely understand why business has to strive for sustainability.</p>
<p>Taking it back to the issue of poverty  and how to end it. There are many approaches that have been suggested even though nobody really knows how, if this can be done. One of the problems with the influential thought on development and poverty is that the thinkers often write to win political arguments in their home countries. </p>
<p>The likes of William Easterly for example generate enormous following as do the likes of the Jeffrey Sachs. While Easterly is very very wrong to pretend that any developing countries in our time, especially the really large ones, have made any developmental gains by simply creating a free market and then stepping back, leaving it to be while it generated 13% growth for 15 years straight by itself. The likes of Jeffrey Sachs would not face up to the fact that aid simply does not work and was never designed to work. </p>
<p>The Washington consensus might have dissolved and disappeared but there really is no longer any debate about whether to use the market or not. The market is, and has been the accepted way for a majority of countries. One thing that has till now not been in dispute is the need for foreign investment. That comes through and by the means of foreign multinationals.</p>
<p>C.K. Pralahad did some good work in identifying how some multinationals have done well to serve the world's poor and what all others need to copy. He identifies that the participation of multinationals in some of these markets remove real suffering from poor consumers.</p>
<p>Poverty will not be solved without business. Some thought Communism could do it. It did not. Now we need to get poor countries to work and multinationals to work with them.</p>
<p><strong>How to solve the problems of multinational wrong-doing? </p>
<p>1. Bolster regulation and regulators in poor countries.<br />
2. Give legal and accounting incentives for good behaviour.<br />
3. Remove the tendency of the media to ignore some parts of the world which are often where multinationals commit murder, sometimes literally.<br />
4. Multinationals have to be pushed to be more transparent in their operations. The transparent could be in hindsight to protect rights.<br />
5. Keep working on getting a more balanced and fairer international trading system.<br />

Imagine this multinational also illegally conducts a shady trade in drugs, and arms. </h3>
<p>The East Indian Company was granted a royal charter in 1600. This charter signified a monopoly over British trade with India. It was the world's joint-stock company. It was the world's first multinational. This company generated immense wealth for the British crown and its other shareholders. It had the power, to negotiate treaties, establish alliances build forts, and even to wage war.</p>
<p>Today, virtually all of the world's largest companies are multinationals. They maintain large staff across the world, use enormous bargaining power to push their business agendas. They move operations around to keep profits high. Some successors of the British East India company have operated in some foreign countries and still routinely repatriate all their profits.</p>
<p>They have come under serious attack. With May 1st approaching , the armies of anti-globalisation activists, and anti-free trade types are preparing for huge demonstrations worldwide. The multinationals will be called agents of imperialism, the enforcers of third world poverty who care more about money than people and society.</p>
<p>Many of the allegations labelled at multinationals are true. One was involved in circumventing US sanctions against Iran. Another has overseen the rape of the Niger Delta.  Yet another is virtually suprastate and has been involved in bringing down governments and supported grave human rights abuses.It came out that one has been  illegally and secretly testing drugs on unsuspecting and poverty-stricken people.  We could go on and on....</p>
<p>One thing that has scared people about multinationals is that, as corporations, their chief responsibility is to shareholders, yet they have steadily acquired power at the expense of host governments and home country governments. The use of the power has sometimes crossed bounds of what is ethical. With globalisation and free trade pushing radical changes in people's lives, multinationals being at the centre of both are at the centre of the threats many many people perceive on their lives and livelihoods.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are hundreds of poor countries stuck in vicious circles of underdevelopment, and looking for foreign investment to overhaul their despondence. The largest volumes of foreign investment come from multinational corporations whose entry into any market is always coincident with thousands of new job, tens or hundreds of millions in new economic activity and new technology.</p>
<p>They come with the creme of the world's managerial talent, modern ideas and they steadily proceed to establish a value chain. They transfer and create great capabilities in the companies that handle their logistics, their input, their engineering etc. (their value chains). </p>
<p>China has shown the positive effect that multinationals can, and do have. A great deal of Chinese companies are joint ventures with foreign companies. China's growth and steady technological climb has been tied to the influx of foreign investments and the multinational corporations that bring them. </p>
<p>They have a definite role to play in the drive to eradicate the poverty pandemic. One of the unheralded initiatives of Kofi Annan as United Nations Secretary General was the creation of the Global Compact. The Global Compact has brought governments, aid agencies, and giant multinationals together to coordinate approaches to the eradication of want.</p>
<p>While multinationals frequently do very evil things they do have redeeming features. They are like our governments, with all their bureaucracy and abuses of power, necessary evil*.</p>

<p> Want a snapshot of the state of the global economy? Check out the first-quarter earnings at General Electric. There's strong growth overseas as developing countries build out their infrastructure and some difficulties in the United States as housing and mortgage troubles take their toll.</p>
<p>Overall, GE posted first-quarter earnings of $4.5 billion on Apr. 13, up 2% from the same period in 2006, helped in large part by rising infrastructure sales.</p>
<p>The diversified manufacturing, media and financial services conglomerate also said that its results were dogged by weak performance in its health care, industrial, and NBC units, as well as GE money which makes loans to people with less than stellar credit.</p>
<p>The Fairfield-based company reported per-share earnings of 44 cents, which was in line with estimates by analysts polled by Thomson Financial.

<p>The apex bank also indicated its readiness to surrender its head office in Abuja to the African Central Bank (ACB) anytime the African Union approves the take-off of the continental bank.</p>
<p>CBN governor, Chukwuma Soludo, stated these yesterday in Abuja at the quarterly economic forum chaired by President Olusegun Obasanjo. Soludo said that it was only a matter of time for the CBN to become only a branch of the ACB.</p>
<p>He said that the bank was working toward the internationalisation of the naira and that already, the currency, which had remained stable for months now, was being traded in the international money market.</p>
<p>Soludo said that overseas remittances from Nigerians abroad went up to 7.7 billion dollars last year, an amount that was higher the GDP of 29 of the 53 countries in Africa.</p>
<p>Soludo said that the CBN was also planning to establish an international financial centre in the Lekki peninsula of Lagos and that the centre would be in the mould of similar centres in Dubai and Singapore.</p>
<p>He said that for the country to join the league of 11 countries in the world that had been projected to be among developed countries by the year 2025, it must record an annual growth rate of 12.5 per cent.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an important bit of news because a $7.7 Billion industry is not a little one.

The full list is to be found here. There was also <a href="http://www2.goldmansachs.com/insight/research/reports/99.pdf">the famous report which sees the quartet of Brazil, Russia, India and China surpassing the G7 in terms of volume of world output before 2050</a>.  </p>
<p>If these projections turn out to be correct, the consequent impact on the world would not be insignificant. The West would no longer completely rule the rest. Smaller countries of the West will be especially hit. Countries like Italy which today are economic giants could especially be at threat. </p>
<p>Take the issue of resources. China's growth has already driven resource markets wild. Prices have gone higher for<br />
these inputs and are expected to grow higher. The size of domestic sourcing pools for resources will count more. Let's take talent for example. People like Bill Gates already reckon that the United States does not have enough of a supply of  certain technical personnel to keep its competitive advantage in technology. If this is true, what does this say about Belgium, or Finland or Sweden? It seems that for every single resource, the ability to find cheap sources at home is going to count more.</p>
<p>Did you notice that on the list of the Next-11, the countries that would come into the club of the world's largest, most powerful economies, one factor is the single common denominator. Population and land mass.  Most of them have huge, growing populations and expanses of land mass. Most of these countries have huge resources and are creating new sources of them all the time. How much land exists in Switzerland for growing corn for biofuels.</p>
<p>Is the growth of the newly emerging economies a threat to the old ones? If you believe that the rich world keeps the poor world poor, you're essentially saying this.  Or at least you are saying that the rich world sees it as such.</p>
<p>This is not Tom Friedman's flat world. If anything this view of the world is of a pyramid. A pyramid with a very wide base and narrow peak. Yet there is enough in the world today that shows that Tom Friedman's view, much as it has come under heavy fire recently, does have some value to it.</p>
<p>Let's take the theoretical view first. In theory, a globalised world favour the bottom of the pyramid almost as much as it benefits those at the rarefied heights of its peak. Much as Western corporations expand their value chains worldwide and develop complex but extremely efficient flows of value across territories and jurisdiction to bridge opportunities and breach limits, the flattening of markets allows poor small-scale but organised producers in developing countries to sell in developed markets.</p>
<p>These opportunities also exist in practice. The challenge is in orientating developing countries to fulfil them. India's offshoring industry might be dominated by large corporations but cooperatives of poor but educated people in Kenya, if backed by technology,  can compete for lower-end service processing. Envelope stuffing for example.</p>
<p>In this view, there is no reason for growth in one part to take food off tables in another part. The evidence available about this is quite substantial too. Our world, especially our world of consumption has become very much interconnected and interdependent.</p>
<p>On the other hand what can be said about countries that consume more than their size. Yes this refers to the United States. Take any commodity whatsoever, and America consumes more per capita than any other country. Of course the rise of China has changed this. China now consumes more of so many things that does the United States. Now that we have mentioned both China and the United States, you know what is coming next. The point that will follow is that the rise of newer economic powerhouses, even if they do not consume at the American rate would in some way threaten the price of US consumption. </p>
<p>We all use the same inputs sourced from a limited font. Production of copper, tungsten, oil, palm oil, starch, sillicon, etc is limited. Increase in demand brings up some few issues.</p>
<p>1. Standard of living. In the rich West, standard of living is directly related to the number of goods and services available for consumption. One of the most solemn vows of every Western government is to protect the standard of living of its people as defined. This standard of living can however be threatened by market forced reductions in consumption. If the price of petrol increases enough, Americans would eventually drive less, and so consume fewer fast foods, which would consume less something or the other. </p>
<p>Do not get anything written here wrong. The tone is not fatalist. I am with the optimists. I have been very deeply impressed with Bjorn Lomborg and his New Optimism.  I hate his politics related to the Kyoto Protocol.  Nevertheless, he has been quite right in pointing out that mobilising resources and keeping the flow of trade and economic growth going is the approach. He has also been quite right that in the end, the world has in reality been much better off than 50 years ago. He points out that all the pessimistic predictions of the future of the last 40 years have been very wrong. He shows how even optimists' best hopes have been surpassed.</p>
<p>Still it just seems that there would have to be a period of adjusting for some countries. In France for example, people are saying that is appears that, for the first time in history, we would have a generation live worse than their parents did. In the United States where growth in the Bush years has been driven by cheap consumer loans and consumption, the non-arrival of another 1990s productivity bump might see standards of living decline. </p>
<p>2. The Military Dimension. The Suez Crisis showed how much economic interests are tied to military interests. Britain and France got the humiliation of their national lives from that conflict but it very much is a case study of how the major economic powers depend on the imbalances in the world for their economic well-being. </p>
<p>In discussing this with a friend sometime, he had the position that the Suez crisis occurred close to 50 years ago and would most probably not recur. Without pointing him to this analysis this was the question to him that I now pose to you ,dear reader.: </p>
<p><strong>What if Panama closed the Panama Canal?</strong></p>
<p>I can add others that also have the same import;</p>
<p>What if Nigeria decided to stop selling oil?</p>
<p>What if the Chinese Communists decided they can't afford to have their economy dependent on US imports and close up?</p>
<p>What if gas in California really did become $15 a gallon?</p>
<p>What would happen in any of these cases?</p>
<p>Each of these questions fall within the province of legitimate decisions about their development that these developing countries could have to make. Nigeria for example has one of the most ecologically raped environments around on account of oil production. Beyond that oil has been a curse to the country. Closing the canal could be a way for an emergent Panamanian shipping industry to become competitive.</p>
<p>Are the economic interests of the developing world fundamentally opposed to those of the rich countries?</p>

<p>    March 16 (Bloomberg) -- China's economic expansion, the source of about a 10th of global growth last year, is unstable and environmentally unsustainable, Premier Wen Jiabao said.       </p>
<p>    ``China's investment growth is too high, lending growth too fast, liquidity excessive and trade and international payments very imbalanced,'' Wen said at a press conference in Beijing today. Energy efficiency and environmental protection issues haven't been ``properly resolved,'' he said.                </p>
<p>    Wen's comments underscore government concern that too many factories are being built in China, worsening pollution and leaving the world's fastest-growing major economy vulnerable to a slowdown in demand. A record $177.5 billion trade surplus has flooded the economy with cash, making it harder for the government to cool investment by reining in bank lending.      </p>
<p>    ``China has maintained relatively steady and fast growth over the past few years, but this is not a time for complacency,'' Wen told reporters at the National People's Congress meeting. ``The biggest problem in China's economy is that the growth is unstable, imbalanced, uncoordinated and unsustainable.'</p>
<p>This is very big news, and effectively amounts to an admittance that the next growth revisions we will probably see for the country will be around 8 - 9%. While this is still strong, it will have wide-ranging impacts for demand in commodities in particular, to growth in the south east Asian region.</p></blockquote></div><div class="vine-p p-content_TagList"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/business" rel="tag">business</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/china" rel="tag">china</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/economics" rel="tag">economics</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/growth" rel="tag">growth</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/national-peoples-congress" rel="tag">national-peoples-congress</a></div><div class="vine-p p-content_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22contentId%22%3A%22617053%22%2C%22headline%22%3A%22China%27s+Economy+growing+too+fast-+Premier%22%2C%22authorDomain%22%3A%22200MilesUp%22%7D"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><span class="numCount">3</span><span class="label">votes</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_uparrow_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Vote for this story to help push it up the Vine." /></span></li><li class="box comments"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/03/16/617053-chinas-economy-growing-too-fast-premier#comments" title="View Comments">0<span class="label"> comments</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_comment_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Comments" title="Comments" /></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="clearer"><span></span></div></li><li class="vine-contentList-item-610197"><img src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=http3A2F2Fwww.newsvine.com2F_vine2Fimages2Fav2F120x1202F200MilesUp-1410636418.jpg&width=30" width="30" height="30" alt="" class="post_avatar" /><div class="headline"><a class="icon" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601100&amp;sid=aJjkmU7_8URM&amp;refer=germany" title="Direct Link To Story"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/ico/564.gif" alt="Direct Link To Story" width="16" height="16" /></a><h1><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/03/12/610197-ecbs-trichet-says-world-economy-can-weather-market-decline">ECB's Trichet says world economy can weather market decline</a></h1></div><div class="dateline">Seeded on Mon Mar 12, 2007 10:31 AM EDT (Bloomberg.com)</div><div class="teaser"><blockquote><p>March 12 (Bloomberg) -- European Central Bank President Jean- Claude Trichet said world economies are strong enough to withstand the slump in stock markets earlier this month.</p>

<p>Sure, we expected a discrepancy, but the size of the gap was startling. It became even more interesting when we broke down those hits with Google Trends.

The idea is not to humiliate, but to alert co-workers to problems and enlist their help in finding solutions. It took a while for Newton, a general manager at Toyota's North American manufacturing subsidiary in Erlanger, Kentucky, to fully take this to heart. But now she is a convert.</p>
<p>"For Americans and anyone, it can be a shock to the system to be actually expected to make problems visible," said Newton, a 38-year-old Indiana native who joined Toyota out of college 15 years ago. "Other corporate environments tend to hide problems from bosses."</p>
<p>Now, practices like these are mission critical for Toyota. This corporate culture transformed Toyota from a small manufacturer into a market-gobbling giant famous for giving workers control over production lines.<br />

<p>But as Toyota becomes the world's largest automaker, it needs to sharpen its game to meet even larger challenges, including raising quality in the face of rapid overseas expansion and undertaking its largest recalls in history. That task takes place behind the closed doors of a nondescript cluster of buildings in the lakeside town of Mikkabi, an hour away from the humble-looking headquarters of Toyota, in Toyota City.</p>
<p>It is the Toyota Institute, charged with preparing promising executives to enter the leadership class at Toyota by inculcating them with some of the most prized management secrets in corporate Japan.</p>
<p>The institute proselytizes as though it were preaching a business religion, sending off its executives as missionaries of sorts for the Toyota Way to offices around the world. It doesn't quite aspire to be Japan's answer to General Electric's famed Crotonville, New York, training center, which spawned a generation of top executives across American industry. But it is Toyota's best effort to avoid the short-sightedness of General Motors and Ford, and to keep the company true to its original mission of winning customers with quality cars, even as it comes under intensifying scrutiny as global No.1.</p>
<p>"There is a sense of danger," said Koki Konishi, a Toyota general manager who heads the institute. "We must prevent the Toyota Way from getting more and more diluted as Toyota grows overseas."</p></blockquote></div><div class="vine-p p-content_TagList"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/business" rel="tag">business</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/toyota" rel="tag">toyota</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/quality" rel="tag">quality</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/continuous-improvement" rel="tag">continuous-improvement</a></div><div class="vine-p p-content_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22contentId%22%3A%22568111%22%2C%22headline%22%3A%22The+Toyota+way+gets+diluted+by+overseas+expansion%22%2C%22authorDomain%22%3A%22200MilesUp%22%7D"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><span class="numCount">1</span><span class="label">vote</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_uparrow_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Vote for this story to help push it up the Vine." /></span></li><li class="box comments"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/02/14/568111-the-toyota-way-gets-diluted-by-overseas-expansion#comments" title="View Comments">1<span class="label"> comment</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_comment_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Comments" title="Comments" /></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="clearer"><span></span></div></li><li class="vine-contentList-item-560114"><img src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=http3A2F2Fwww.newsvine.com2F_vine2Fimages2Fav2F120x1202F200MilesUp-1410636418.jpg&width=30" width="30" height="30" alt="" class="post_avatar" /><div class="headline"><a class="icon" href="http://www.freemarketnews.com/Analysis/156/6891/fed.asp?wid=156&amp;nid=6891" title="Direct Link To Story"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/ico/1277.gif" alt="Direct Link To Story" width="16" height="16" /></a><h1><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/02/09/560114-how-the-fed-lost-control-of-money-supply">How the Fed Lost Control of Money Supply</a></h1></div><div class="dateline">Seeded on Fri Feb 9, 2007 7:43 AM EST (CNET News.com)</div><div class="teaser"><blockquote><p>A year ago, the Fed stopped publishing M3, a broad measure of money supply. Just because you lose control of something doesn't mean you shouldn't monitor it anymore. Of the major central banks around the world, only the ECB takes an active interest in money supply.</p>
<p>Why is it that the Fed doesn't intervene and try to stem excesses in the credit industry? We find the answer by circling back to the consumer: if the Fed were to do something about the spiraling credit expansion in the derivatives markets, the imposed tightening would quite likely hurt the consumer. Typically, a recession would not scare the Fed, but globalization has put the fear of deflation on Fed chairman Bernanke's table. Tight credit could cause a collapse in the housing market and in consumer spending; what has been a great boom would turn into a great bust.</p>
<p>The fear also spills over to the U.S. dollar: as a result of the current account deficit foreigners must purchase in excess of over $2 billion U.S. dollar denominated assets every single day, just to keep the dollar from falling. As the U.S. economy slows, foreigners may be more inclined to invest some of their money elsewhere. The rising price of gold reflects that many investors believe that the Fed rather see a continuation of monetary expansion than allowing a severe contraction. Fed chairman Bernanke has also made it clear in his publications that he favors monetary stimulus at the expense of the dollar to mitigate hardship on the population at large.</p>
<p>Market forces will try to bring this credit expansion to a halt. While a crisis scenario with an imploding hedge fund causing ripple effects through the financial sector is possible and likely, we don't need a crisis for the party to end. What we need is increased volatility which we have already seen in the commodities and bond markets; the equity and currency markets have also indicated volatility may be on its way back. As volatility increases, speculators are likely to pare down their leverage. In our assessment, the economic slowdown induced merely by an increase in volatility may be sufficient to encourage the Fed to ease monetary policy once again. Any easing in this context will, in our assessment, have negative implications for the dollar.</p></blockquote></div><div class="vine-p p-content_TagList"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/business" rel="tag">business</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/credit" rel="tag">credit</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/economics" rel="tag">economics</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/federal-reserve" rel="tag">federal-reserve</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/consumers" rel="tag">consumers</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/m3" rel="tag">m3</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/money-supply" rel="tag">money-supply</a></div><div class="vine-p p-content_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22contentId%22%3A%22560114%22%2C%22headline%22%3A%22How+the+Fed+Lost+Control+of+Money+Supply%22%2C%22authorDomain%22%3A%22200MilesUp%22%7D"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><span class="numCount">9</span><span class="label">votes</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_uparrow_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Vote for this story to help push it up the Vine." /></span></li><li class="box comments"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/02/09/560114-how-the-fed-lost-control-of-money-supply#comments" title="View Comments">12<span class="label"> comments</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_comment_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Comments" title="Comments" /></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="clearer"><span></span></div></li><li class="vine-contentList-item-557433"><img src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=http3A2F2Fwww.newsvine.com2F_vine2Fimages2Fav2F120x1202F200MilesUp-1410636418.jpg&width=30" width="30" height="30" alt="" class="post_avatar" /><div class="headline"><a class="icon" href="http://www.greenrising.com/index.php/2007/02/07/the-global-100-most-sustainable-corporations-in-the-world/" title="Direct Link To Story"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/extlink_16.gif" alt="Direct Link To Story" width="16" height="16" /></a><h1><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/02/07/557433-the-global-100-most-sustainable-corporations-in-the-world">The Global 100: Most Sustainable Corporations in the World</a></h1></div><div class="dateline">Seeded on Wed Feb 7, 2007 4:59 PM EST (greenrising.com)</div><div class="teaser"><blockquote><p>The Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World is a project initiated by Corporate Knights Inc. with Innovest Strategic Value Advisors Inc., a leading research firm specializing in analyzing extra-financial drivers of risk and shareholder value, including companies' performance on social, environmental and strategic governance issues.

US legislation permits President George W. Bush to take action against non-US companies investing in Iran's energy sector. However, because of concerns over an extra-territorial trade dispute and the risk of further alienating allies, no foreign companies have been penalised to date under the Iran Libya Sanctions Act and the subsequent Iran Freedom Support Act.(...) The agreement does not put a figure on the value of the project. Shell and its partners are still working on cost estimates. But it was suggested in Iran at the weekend that it could be worth $10bn (£5bn). Shell and Repsol would each have 25 per cent of the project, with the National Iranian Oil Company holding 50 per cent. Iran holds the world's second largest gas reserves, after Russia.

<p>Last June, Norway's powerful ombudsman said iTunes violated Norwegian law by forcing consumers to play their downloaded music on Apple's iPod music player -- a landmark decision which prompted other European countries to review the situation.</p>
<p>"They must make iTunes music compatible with other players than the iPod by the end of September, or we will take them to court," the ombudsman, Bjoern Erik Thon, told Reuters.</p>
<p>"ITunes is imposing unreasonable and unbalanced restrictions that are not in accordance with Norwegian law."</p>
<p>He said the courts could impose fines on iTunes until songs downloaded through iTunes could be played on rival devices to the popular iPod. The case would first be handled by Norway's Market Council, a special legal body that has the power to demand changes to contract clauses that are found to be unreasonable. If appealed, the case would move on to the ordinary courts.</p></blockquote></div><div class="vine-p p-content_TagList"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/technology" rel="tag">technology</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/business" rel="tag">business</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/norway" rel="tag">norway</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/europe" rel="tag">europe</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/apple" rel="tag">apple</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/competition" rel="tag">competition</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/itunes" rel="tag">itunes</a></div><div class="vine-p p-content_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22contentId%22%3A%22536941%22%2C%22headline%22%3A%22Norway+tells+Apple+change+iTunes+or+face+court+%22%2C%22authorDomain%22%3A%22200MilesUp%22%7D"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><span class="numCount">4</span><span class="label">votes</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_uparrow_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Vote for this story to help push it up the Vine." /></span></li><li class="box comments"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/01/25/536941-norway-tells-apple-change-itunes-or-face-court#comments" title="View Comments">1<span class="label"> comment</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_comment_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Comments" title="Comments" /></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="clearer"><span></span></div></li><li class="vine-contentList-item-533385"><img src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=http3A2F2Fwww.newsvine.com2F_vine2Fimages2Fav2F120x1202F200MilesUp-1410636418.jpg&width=30" width="30" height="30" alt="" class="post_avatar" /><div class="headline"><a class="icon" href="http://www.businessweek.com/ap/financialnews/D8MQUVD80.htm" title="Direct Link To Story"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/ico/143.gif" alt="Direct Link To Story" width="16" height="16" /></a><h1><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2007/01/23/533385-eu-takes-tough-line-with-france-germany-italy-on-public-debt">EU takes tough line with France, Germany & Italy on public debt</a></h1></div><div class="dateline">Seeded on Tue Jan 23, 2007 7:31 AM EST (Business Week)</div><div class="teaser"><blockquote><p>Germany, France and Italy should make "greater efforts" to bring down government debt over the next four years, the European Commission said Tuesday, urging them to use higher-than-expected tax receipts to balance the books.</p>

<p>Last month, Ailin Graef issued a press release announcing that the company's total holdings, comprised mainly of virtual land in Second Life, were worth more than a million real-life dollars. For those who aren't familiar with the complex economies of virtual worlds, such a claim may seem incomprehensible.</p>
<p>But for anyone who has spent significant time in Second Life, the number seems all too possible, given Chung's dominance of the land market there.</p>
<p>On Monday, Graef visited CNET's Second Life bureau for a discussion about her business, how best to set up businesses in Second Life and the nature of competition there.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as the interview was commencing, the event was attacked by a "griefer," someone intent on disrupting the proceedings. The griefer managed to assault the CNET theater for 15 minutes with--well, there's no way to say this delicately--animated flying penises.<br />
The biggest challenge was the established elite that existed in Second Life before I joined.</p>
<p>Chung refused to continue the interview in the CNET theater but agreed to go on in her own space.</p>
<p>Once restarted, the interview was attacked again, and the protester even managed to crash the entire server on which Chung's theater is held.</p></blockquote></div><div class="vine-p p-content_TagList"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/technology" rel="tag">technology</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/business" rel="tag">business</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/second-life" rel="tag">second-life</a></div><div class="vine-p p-content_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22contentId%22%3A%22489691%22%2C%22headline%22%3A%222nd+life%3A+Virtual+land+magnate+shares+secrets+of+her+success+%22%2C%22authorDomain%22%3A%22200MilesUp%22%7D"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><span class="numCount">6</span><span class="label">votes</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_uparrow_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Vote for this story to help push it up the Vine." /></span></li><li class="box comments"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2006/12/20/489691-2nd-life-virtual-land-magnate-shares-secrets-of-her-success#comments" title="View Comments">4<span class="label"> comments</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_comment_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Comments" title="Comments" /></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="clearer"><span></span></div></li><li class="vine-contentList-item-489647"><img src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=http3A2F2Fwww.newsvine.com2F_vine2Fimages2Fav2F120x1202F200MilesUp-1410636418.jpg&width=30" width="30" height="30" alt="" class="post_avatar" /><div class="headline"><a class="icon" href="http://en.rian.ru/russia/20061220/57378674.html" title="Direct Link To Story"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/extlink_16.gif" alt="Direct Link To Story" width="16" height="16" /></a><h1><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2006/12/20/489647-russias-gdp-could-grow-7-in-2006-deputy-pm">Russia's GDP could grow 7% in 2006 - deputy PM </a></h1></div><div class="dateline">Seeded on Wed Dec 20, 2006 8:33 AM EST (Top Russian news and analysis online | 'RIA Novosti' newswire)</div><div class="teaser"><blockquote><p>Russia's gross domestic product could grow 7% in 2006, a deputy prime minister said Wednesday.</p>

<p>Zhukov told the lower house of parliament that Russia's GDP was earlier projected to increase 6.3% in 2006. GDP growth in 2005 was 6.4%.</p>
<p>Addressing State Duma deputies at a "government hour," the deputy premier discussed IPOs of Russian companies, annual inflation compared to targets, capital inflow, and the country's bid to join the World Trade Organization.</p>
<p>Zhukov said the number of Russian companies that have held initial public offerings has tripled in the past 18 months, a process that the government welcomes. He added that 2006 has rightly been called the "year of the IPO" in Russia.</p>
<p>The year's inflation totaled 8.5% as of December 11, the deputy premier said.</p>

<p>But recently they have discovered that down on the ground, new technology has given low cost, face-to-face marketing campaigns something of a cutting edge as consumers spread their messages on the Internet.</p>
<p>Take the recent display of public toilets set up by Charmin bathroom tissue: Used by thousands in Times Square and viewed by 7,400 Web users on one site alone. Or Nascar's recent display of racecars; videos of the event have been viewed on YouTube more than 1,800 times. More than 60 people wrote about the event on their blogs and 60 more spread the word — and pictures — on the Flickr Web site.</p>
<p>"The great thing about the digital world is you can capture these events," said Christian McMahan, brand director for Smirnoff Ice, owned by Diageo. "People can see them whether they were there that day or 3,000 miles away."</p>
<p>As a result of the growing popularity of consumer-generated pictures, videos and e-mail messages on Internet sites like YouTube and Myspace, advertisers are getting consumers to essentially do their jobs for them.</p>
<p>When Target, the discount store operator, suspended the magician David Blaine above Times Square for two days during the week of Thanksgiving, videos shot by viewers were posted on YouTube and viewed more than 19,300 times.</p>
<p>"Times Square is becoming, in a way, a publishing platform," said Peter Stabler, director of communication strategy for Goodby, Silverstein and Partners, an advertising agency that is part of the Omnicom Group. "What happens in Times Square is no longer strictly the province of location. You can experience things that are happening there, even if you're not there."</p>
<p>On sites like YouTube, Flickr and MySpace, an army of tourists and residents are spreading advertisers' messages well beyond Manhattan, using their cell phones and video cameras as they walk through the marketing crossroads of the world.</p></blockquote></div><div class="vine-p p-content_TagList"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/business" rel="tag">business</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/new-york" rel="tag">new-york</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/marketing" rel="tag">marketing</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/billboards" rel="tag">billboards</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/youtube" rel="tag">youtube</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/virals" rel="tag">virals</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/time-square" rel="tag">time-square</a></div><div class="vine-p p-content_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22contentId%22%3A%22478966%22%2C%22headline%22%3A%22Times+Square+ads+spread+via+tourists%27+cameras%22%2C%22authorDomain%22%3A%22200MilesUp%22%7D"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><span class="numCount">1</span><span class="label">vote</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_uparrow_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Vote for this story to help push it up the Vine." /></span></li><li class="box comments"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2006/12/12/478966-times-square-ads-spread-via-tourists-cameras#comments" title="View Comments">0<span class="label"> comments</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_comment_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Comments" title="Comments" /></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="clearer"><span></span></div></li><li class="vine-contentList-item-478630"><img src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=http3A2F2Fwww.newsvine.com2F_vine2Fimages2Fav2F120x1202F200MilesUp-1410636418.jpg&width=30" width="30" height="30" alt="" class="post_avatar" /><div class="headline"><a class="icon" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/russia/article/0,,1970064,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=1" title="Direct Link To Story"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/ico/103.gif" alt="Direct Link To Story" width="16" height="16" /></a><h1><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2006/12/12/478630-20bn-gas-project-seized-by-russia">$20bn gas project seized by Russia </a></h1></div><div class="dateline">Seeded on Tue Dec 12, 2006 5:30 AM EST (Guardian Unlimited)</div><div class="teaser"><blockquote><p>Shell is being forced by the Russian government to hand over its controlling stake in the world's biggest liquefied gas project, provoking fresh fears about the Kremlin's willingness to use the country's growing strength in natural resources as a political weapon.</p>
<p>After months of relentless pressure from Moscow, the Anglo-Dutch company has to cut its stake in the $20bn Sakhalin-2 scheme in the far east of Russia in favour of the state-owned energy group Gazprom.</p>
<p>The Russian authorities are also threatening BP over alleged environmental violations on a Siberian field in what is seen as a wider attempt to seize back assets handed over to foreign companies when energy prices were low.</p>
<p>The moves will alarm many investors in the City of London as Shell and other share prices are hit, but the news will also increase ministers' concerns about Britain's energy security.</p>
<p>Russia is becoming a key source of natural gas to the UK and Gazprom has already made clear it would like to buy a company such as Centrica, which owns British Gas. One third of western Europe's natural gas is supplied by Russia - a figure expected to rise over the next decade. The security of energy supply is now the main political issue between the EU and the Kremlin.

<p>A generally benign economic background – the result of an economic upturn in Europe and Japan along with strong growth in emerging nations such as China and India – has provided a sturdy platform for the strengthening role for manufacturing in the rich countries.

Top Management pay or larger companies?</a></h1></div><div class="dateline">Seeded on Sun Dec 10, 2006 9:55 AM EST (The Economist)</div><div class="teaser"><blockquote><p>The best explanation is not greedier bosses or lazy boards; it is bigger companies.  If the CEO of a $100 million dollar company causes his stock to rise 5%, he has earned $5 million dollars for his shareholders; if he gets 1% of that in incentive pay, he will have a nice, but not eye-popping, $50,000 bonus in his Christmas stocking.  Do that excercise with a $100 billion dollar company, and suddenly our CEO is pulling down $50,000,000 in cash.  The CEO is not any better at his job, necessarily; but he is more valuable to his shareholders in absolute, if not in relative terms.  And so are the top management people around him, who make the most difference to whether he makes his numbers.</p>
<p>Larger market cap also probably means more shareholders, who each have less incentive to worry about the CEO's pay.  With companies so big, taking all the CEO's pay and distributing it back--whether to the workers or the shareholders--would produce relatively small gains for either group.  For example, if you took Yahoo! chairman Terry Semel's $250 million 5-year compensation package and distributed it evenly among each of his employees, they'd get about $150 extra in each pay packet; perhaps $90 after taxes were taken out.  I wouldn't sneeze at a $90 a week raise, but it probably wouldn't lift me into the next tax bracket.</p></blockquote></div><div class="vine-p p-content_TagList"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/business" rel="tag">business</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/politics" rel="tag">politics</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/economics" rel="tag">economics</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/pay" rel="tag">pay</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/us-news" rel="tag">us-news</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/top-management" rel="tag">top-management</a></div><div class="vine-p p-content_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22contentId%22%3A%22476262%22%2C%22headline%22%3A%22What%27s+increasing+inequality%3F+Top+Management+pay+or+larger+companies%3F%22%2C%22authorDomain%22%3A%22200MilesUp%22%7D"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><span class="numCount">4</span><span class="label">votes</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_uparrow_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Vote for this story to help push it up the Vine." /></span></li><li class="box comments"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2006/12/10/476262-whats-increasing-inequality-top-management-pay-or-larger-companies#comments" title="View Comments">3<span class="label"> comments</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_comment_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Comments" title="Comments" /></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="clearer"><span></span></div></li><li class="vine-contentList-item-474543"><img src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=http3A2F2Fwww.newsvine.com2F_vine2Fimages2Fav2F120x1202F200MilesUp-1410636418.jpg&width=30" width="30" height="30" alt="" class="post_avatar" /><div class="headline"><a class="icon" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601082&amp;sid=awBxSdGiS40s&amp;refer=canada" title="Direct Link To Story"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/ico/564.gif" alt="Direct Link To Story" width="16" height="16" /></a><h1><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2006/12/08/474543-oecd-leading-indicators-predict-world-growth-in-2007">OECD leading indicators predict World growth in 2007</a></h1></div><div class="dateline">Seeded on Fri Dec 8, 2006 4:08 PM EST (Bloomberg.com)</div><div class="teaser"><blockquote><p>The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said the world economy will continue to expand next year.</p>

After our recent RBC-sponsored field trip, we have taken a detailed look at the country's mineral potential, and set that against the infrastructure challenges it faces if it is to unlock its vast resource wealth".</p>
<p>Smith's report reviews 11 companies with key operations in the DRC, which houses an estimated 80% of the world's coltan (a colloquial name for columbite-tantalite, a metallic ore comprising niobium and tantalum), 34% of its cobalt and 10% of its copper reserves. The country's gold potential is virtually untouched, with the Congo craton being Africa's largest under-explored region in terms of Archaean geology.</p>
<p>There are huge challenges, but equally, huge opportunities, in the DRC. The country has limited energy resources, but potential to generate enough power to run just about the entire African continent. After years of neglect, the Inga Dam produces only about 40% of the DRC's hydroelectric capacity of 1 736MW, and less than 2% of the Congo River's power generating potential of up to 39 000MW.</p>
<p>The Congo River represents one of the world's best hydroelectric sites, and the cheapest source of hydropower. Like its hydro electric potential, the DRC's road infrastructure is very limited. In a country the size of Western Europe, there is less than 2 250km of paved roads. Thanks to development funding, there are four road projects currently underway in the DRC, totaling 7 230km of rehabilitation.</p></blockquote></div><div class="vine-p p-content_TagList"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/business" rel="tag">business</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/energy" rel="tag">energy</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/power" rel="tag">power</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/mining" rel="tag">mining</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/minerals" rel="tag">minerals</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/congo-dr" rel="tag">congo-dr</a></div><div class="vine-p p-content_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22contentId%22%3A%22474497%22%2C%22headline%22%3A%22World%27s+biggest+mining+rush+%22%2C%22authorDomain%22%3A%22200MilesUp%22%7D"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><span class="numCount">1</span><span class="label">vote</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_uparrow_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Vote for this story to help push it up the Vine." /></span></li><li class="box comments"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2006/12/08/474497-worlds-biggest-mining-rush#comments" title="View Comments">0<span class="label"> comments</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_comment_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Comments" title="Comments" /></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="clearer"><span></span></div></li><li class="vine-contentList-item-474467"><img src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=http3A2F2Fwww.newsvine.com2F_vine2Fimages2Fav2F120x1202F200MilesUp-1410636418.jpg&width=30" width="30" height="30" alt="" class="post_avatar" /><div class="headline"><a class="icon" href="http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/articleinvesting.aspx?type=fundsNews&amp;storyID=2006-12-08T094742Z_01_NOA835121_RTRUKOC_0_FINANCIAL-ISLAMIC-COMMODITIES.xml&amp;WTmodLoc=HP-C8-Funds-3" title="Direct Link To Story"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/ico/static/59.gif" alt="Direct Link To Story" width="16" height="16" /></a><h1><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2006/12/08/474467-commodities-and-islam-the-start-of-something-big">Commodities and Islam, the start of something big </a></h1></div><div class="dateline">Seeded on Fri Dec 8, 2006 3:22 PM EST (Reuters)</div><div class="teaser"><blockquote><p>Global trade in commodities is booming, and not just because China is hungry for resources.

<p>The Institute for Condom Consultancy is developing a type of spray can into which the man inserts his penis first.</p>
<p>At the push of a button it is then coated in a rubber condom.</p>
<p>"We're trying to develop the perfect condom for men that's suited to every size of penis," spokesman Jan Vinzenz Krause said.</p>
<p>"We're very serious."</p>
<p>Mr Krause says the product aims to help people enjoy better and safer sex lives.</p>
<p>"It works by spraying on latex from nozzles on all sides," he said.</p>
<p>"We call it the '360-degree procedure' - once round and from top to bottom.</p>
<p>"It's a bit like a car wash."</p>
<p>He says the plan is to make the product ready for use in about five seconds.</p>
<p>Mr Krause says the spray-on condom would function more effectively as a contraceptive because it would fit better and not slip.</p>
<p>But before the new condom can be sold in shops, the firm must ensure the latex is evenly spread when sprayed, as well as optimise the vulcanisation process.</p>
<p>The company hopes the high-tech condom, which will be available in different strengths and colours, will be on the market by 2008.</p>
<p>Mr Krause says the spray would probably cost about $30 as a one-off purchase.</p>
<p>He says the latex cartridges, which are sufficient for up to 20 applications, would cost about $17.</p>
<p>Mr Krause says he hit upon the idea when considering the difficulties some people faced using condoms and drew inspiration from spray-on plasters now used in medicine.</p></blockquote></div><div class="vine-p p-content_TagList"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/business" rel="tag">business</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/germany" rel="tag">germany</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/sex" rel="tag">sex</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/odd-news" rel="tag">odd-news</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/men" rel="tag">men</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/condoms" rel="tag">condoms</a></div><div class="vine-p p-content_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22contentId%22%3A%22466444%22%2C%22headline%22%3A%22Firm+hopes+spray-on+condom+will+offer+snug+fit%22%2C%22authorDomain%22%3A%22200MilesUp%22%7D"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><span class="numCount">8</span><span class="label">votes</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_uparrow_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Vote for this story to help push it up the Vine." /></span></li><li class="box comments"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2006/12/02/466444-firm-hopes-spray-on-condom-will-offer-snug-fit#comments" title="View Comments">14<span class="label"> comments</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_comment_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Comments" title="Comments" /></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="clearer"><span></span></div></li><li class="vine-contentList-item-465936"><img src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=http3A2F2Fwww.newsvine.com2F_vine2Fimages2Fav2F120x1202F200MilesUp-1410636418.jpg&width=30" width="30" height="30" alt="" class="post_avatar" /><div class="headline"><a class="icon" href="http://johnfenzel.vox.com/library/post/who-do-you-believe-gold-as-an-inflation-and-market-indicator.html" title="Direct Link To Story"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/extlink_16.gif" alt="Direct Link To Story" width="16" height="16" /></a><h1><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2006/12/02/465936-gold-as-an-inflation-and-market-indicator">Gold as an Inflation and Market Indicator </a></h1></div><div class="dateline">Seeded on Sat Dec 2, 2006 10:36 AM EST (johnfenzel.vox.com)</div><div class="teaser"><blockquote><p>For years, I had a fight with The Wall Street Journal editorial board over its front-page summary of market indexes, which highlights a dozen daily indicators, including stocks, bonds, oil, the dollar, etc.<br />
Yet it deliberately omitted the single-most significant asset that each day measures the level of geo-political and monetary stability around the world: Gold!<br />
Dan Henninger, deputy managing editor of The Journal, wrote me, "We do not believe gold is the best indicator of inflation."<br />
Since the Keynesian revolution of the 1930s, gold has been relegated to a "barbarous relic." The establishment prefers flat money to the gold standard. It wants government rather than the market to maintain authority over money. It doesn't want to legitimatize a "non-performing" asset that might be warning of trouble down the road.</p>
<p>As they say in the commodity trading pits, "Gold is just another commodity."</p>
<p>Wrong! Gold is not just another commodity. Today, let's look at gold as an inflation and market indicator… and what we should be investing in right now.</p>
<p>The Best Inflation Forecaster: Gold, Oil or Interest Rates?</p>
<p>First, how many other commodities have served for centuries as money? Not oil, soybeans, or pork bellies. Moreover, unlike other commodities, gold is never used up in the production process. Annual production increases at a steady 1-2% a year and is added to the total stock of gold, creating a monetary Rock of Gibraltar in a sea of instability.<br />
As a result, gold has always preserved its purchasing power over the long run.

It's one of those silly, and illogical quarks of us Economists.</p>
<blockquote><p>Milton Friedman, who has died aged 94, was not the most important economist of the post-war era - that title belongs to the brilliant Paul Samuelson - but he was certainly the most controversial. Yet despite his views being championed by so many politicians on the right, it may come as a surprise that Friedman's career as a policymaker largely ended in failure.</p>
<p>Given his status as a long-standing hate figure, the assumption by many of the left is that his agenda was cemented into place during the Reagan and Thatcher administrations in the early 1980s, especially Friedman's well-known view that inflation is solely influenced by changes in the money supply. But very few of Friedman's most cherished proposals were ever put in to practice. Of those that where - such as monetarism - almost all turned into failure.</p>
<p>The great irony for Friedman's fans is that the one piece of public policy he was responsible for that was widely and internationally adopted was one that greatly increased the ability of central governments to collect taxes - a policy he later repudiated in disgust.</p>
<p>Obituaries of Friedman will doubtlessly sing of his successes. But close examination will show them to be few, and none unalloyed. For all his high public profile - thanks to his regular column in Newsweek and series on US television, Free To Choose, which made him into something of a star - today no mainstream academic economist is a monetarist and Friedman left no lasting school of academic heirs. Even the "Chicago school" at the University of Chicago has waned in influence, eclipsed by the mighty MIT army of economists that followed Samuelson.</p>
<p>Of course Friedman is greatly respected for his theoretical work as an economist, especially on his analysis of the role of money, the importance of inflation expectations in wages and employment, and perhaps his most lasting contribution (it could be argued), the permanent income hypothesis, which suggests that households take a longer view of anticipating their past and future income than previously thought. His award of a Nobel prize in economics was richly deserved - even if he was churlish in accepting it (he said after winning: "I would not want a professional judgment of my scientific work to be those seven people who selected me for the award").</p></blockquote></div><div class="vine-p p-content_TagList"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/business" rel="tag">business</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/politics" rel="tag">politics</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/economics" rel="tag">economics</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/us-news" rel="tag">us-news</a>, <a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/milton-friedman" rel="tag">milton-friedman</a></div><div class="vine-p p-content_MiniToolbox"><div class="printerData hide" data-printer="%7B%22contentId%22%3A%22449007%22%2C%22headline%22%3A%22Milton+Friedman%3A+a+study+in+failure%22%2C%22authorDomain%22%3A%22200MilesUp%22%7D"></div><ul class="list"><li class="box votes"><span class="numCount">2</span><span class="label">votes</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_uparrow_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Vote for this story to help push it up the Vine." /></span></li><li class="box comments"><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2006/11/19/449007-milton-friedman-a-study-in-failure#comments" title="View Comments">0<span class="label"> comments</span><span class="icon"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/_/i_comment_mini.gif" width="12" height="12" alt="Comments" title="Comments" /></span></a></li></ul></div><div class="clearer"><span></span></div></li><li class="vine-contentList-item-447335"><img src="http://m.static.newsvine.com/servista/imagesizer?file=http3A2F2Fwww.newsvine.com2F_vine2Fimages2Fav2F120x1202F200MilesUp-1410636418.jpg&width=30" width="30" height="30" alt="" class="post_avatar" /><div class="headline"><a class="icon" href="http://www.businessweek.com/globalbiz/content/nov2006/gb20061116_574456.htm?campaign_id=nws_insdr_nov18&amp;link_position=link11" title="Direct Link To Story"><img src="http://www.polls.newsvine.com/_vine/images/ico/143.gif" alt="Direct Link To Story" width="16" height="16" /></a><h1><a href="http://200MilesUp.newsvine.com/_news/2006/11/18/447335-wal-mart-with-wings">Wal-Mart with wings</a></h1></div><div class="dateline">Seeded on Sat Nov 18, 2006 6:51 AM EST (Business Week)</div><div class="teaser"><blockquote><p>CEO Michael O'Leary makes no apologies for his penny-pinching.

For years, his employer, Ningbo Beifa Group, had prospered as a top supplier of pens, mechanical pencils, and highlighters to Wal-Mart Stores (WMT ) and other major retailers. But late last year, Tang learned that auditors from Wal-Mart, Beifa's biggest customer, were about to inspect labor conditions at the factory in the Chinese coastal city of Ningbo where he worked as an administrator. Wal-Mart had already on three occasions caught Beifa paying its 3,000 workers less than China's minimum wage and violating overtime rules, Tang says.
