Melodies with the titles <I>Zui Weng Yin</I> (Old Toper's Chant) and <I>Zui Weng Cao</I> (Old Toper's Melody), survive in at least six known versions.<A NAME="r4" HREF="#f4"><B><SUP>4</SUP></B></A> However, all these melodies are different from the one here in <A HREF="../13fxxp.htm"><I>Fengxuan Xuanpin</I></A> (1539). <I>Fengxuan Xuanpin</I> also has the earliest surviving musical setting of the lyrics found here. These lyrics are a poem attributed to <A HREF="../../09hist/other/sushi.htm">Su Shi</A> (Su Dongpo, 1037-1101).<A NAME="r5" HREF="#f5"><B><SUP>5</SUP></B></A> The Old Toper was Su Dongpo's mentor, the equally famous <A HREF="../../09hist/qinshi/ouyangxiu.htm">Ouyang Xiu</A> (1007-1072). The poetic meter (<I>ci pai</I>) called <I>Zui Weng Cao</I> has the same structure as this poem. 

<P><A NAME="zwtj">Earlier, Ouyang Xiu had written first An Account of the Old Toper' Pavilion,<A NAME="r6" HREF="#f6"><B><SUP>6</SUP></B></A> then a poem called the Old Toper's Chant.<A NAME="r7" HREF="#f7"><B><SUP>7</SUP></B></A> The first referred to a pavilion at his estate by the Langya mountains, near Chuzhou in eastern Anhui province, about 100 km northwest of Nanjing.<A NAME="r8" HREF="#f8"><B><SUP>8</SUP></B></A>

<P><A NAME="zwypref">In the preface to Old Toper's Chant, Ouyang Xiu says that after he wrote An Account of the Old Toper' Pavilion, the scholar Shen Zun<A NAME="r9" HREF="#f9"><B><SUP>9</SUP></B></A> was inspired to go walking in the surrouding area. He loved the landscape there so much that when he returned he composed a <I>qin</I> melody in three sections describing it, called Old Toper's Chant. The following autumn Shen and Ouyang met again. Under the influence of wine Shen played the melody again and music so moved Ouyang that he then created lyrics for it. 

<P>Over thirty years later Su Shi wrote his own poem about the pavilion. From his preface (see below) it seems that the melody of Shen Zun was either lost or had changed, because Su Shi says the reason he wrote new lyrics was that the existing qin melody did not match Ouyang Xiu's lyrics. He adds that his version follows tablature written by a famous qin player from Lu Shan named Cui Xian.<A NAME="r10" HREF="#f10"><B><SUP>10</SUP></B></A>

<P>Su Shi's preface is as follows,<A NAME="r11" HREF="#f11"><B><SUP>11</SUP></B></A>

<DIR>In a hidden valley at Langya the scenery is marvelously beautiful. A spring resounds from a dry gully, in a medley of moderate tones. The Old Toper enjoyed this, and brought wine to listen nearby, appreciating it so much he would forget to return home.

<P>Ten years later the marvel-loving scholar Shen Zun heard of it and traveled there. He used his qin to describe the sounds, and called the melody <I>Zuiweng Cao</I>. The rhythm was exceptional and the music from the fingering was splendid. Qin connoisseurs considered it incomparable. However, although there was now music, it had no words.

<P>Although the Old (Toper) has written a song (of this title), it does not match (Shen Zun's) qin melody. In addition, using the model of the <I>Chu Ci</I> to write (lyrics for the Shen Zun's) <I>Zuiweng Yin</I>, well-meaning people have written melodies in accord with his lyrics; but although these roughly match the modal requirements, and the qin sounds are bound to the lyrics, they do not appear natural.

<P>(Now), over 30 years later, the Old (Toper) has already passed on, and (Shen) Zun is also long deceased. (However), there is a Jade Torrent Daoist Cui Xian of Lu Shan who is especially good at the qin. Hating the fact that this melody has no lyrics, he has written down tablature for the sounds and asked me, Dongpo Jushi, to append (lyrics). These are as follows...."

<P>(For the lyrics see Melody and Lyrics, below).

</DIR><P>The second surviving melody with this title,<A NAME="r12" HREF="#f12"><B><SUP>12</SUP></B></A> the <I>Zui Weng Yin</I> in <A HREF="../21lhqp.htm"><I>Longhu Qinpu</I></A> (1571), is the only version with an introductory preface. It says that the melody expresses a joyful inebriation,<A NAME="r13" HREF="#f13"><B><SUP>13</SUP></B></A> and adds a few other poetic comments, but says nothing of the origin. It might be noted here that, although both the <I>Fengxuan Xianpin</I> and the <I>Longhu Qinpu</I> versions are said to be in <I>shang</I> mode, the former actually seems to use <I>jiao</I> mode, and to modern ears the latter melody seems more joyful.<A NAME="r14" HREF="#f14"><B><SUP>14</SUP></B></A>

<P><A NAME="qyyl"><I>Qinyuan Yaolu</I>, a collection of qin essays printed in the Yuan dynasty, includes <A HREF="../qyyl/qulist.htm#c62"><I>Zuiweng Yin</I></A> in its list of old melodies.

And I have not been able to apply its principles to any of the surviving qin versions of the melody.<A NAME="r17" HREF="#f17"><B><SUP>17</SUP></B></A>

<BR>1539 does not divide the piece, but later versions have two sections, following the lyrics)

<DIR>1. 
<BR>Tinkling, pure and round, whose playing resounds in the empty mountains?
<BR>There are no words, only an old man who when drunk knows of heaven.
<BR>The moon is bright, the wind (causes the) dew to shimmer, people are not yet asleep.
<BR>A carrier of baskets passing the front of the hill says,
<BR>"He has great feelings, does this worthy person."

<P>2. 
<BR>As the Old Toper whistles and sings, the sounds harmonize with the flowing streams.
<BR>After the Old Toper leaves,  
<BR> &#160; the void is filled with (sounds of) morning birds and evening monkeys.
<BR>Mountains sometimes collapse, (and) rivers sometimes reverse course,
<BR>(but) I think the Old (Toper) is completely ageless.
<BR>The Old (Toper) now being an airborne immortal, this thought should be with people:
<BR>Try to listen to listen (to the ethereal resonances) beyond sounds (defined by) finger positions and strings.

</DIR><P>An examination of these versions shows the following.

<P><DIR>The second surviving melody, the <I>Zui Weng Yin</I> in <I>Longhu Qinpu</I> is set to virtually the same lyrics as here, as is another completely different melody, the <A HREF="../japan/jtocs.htm#h12"><I>Zui Weng Cao</I></A> in the Japanese handbooks <I>Wabun Chuyin Kinpu</I> and <I>Toko Kinpu</I>.

<P>The <I>Zui Weng Cao</I> in <I>Shuhuai Cao</I> and <I>Songsheng Cao</I> (companion books to <I>Songfengge Qinpu</I> (ca. 1677), is again different, even using a different tuning, called 側楚 <I>zechu</I>: raise the 7th string and lower the 2nd.

<P>(The Japanese handbooks have only qin songs. Japanese also studied the 松絃館琴譜 <I>Songxianguan Qinpu</I> (1614; QQJC, VIII), but that handbook has no melodies with lyrics.

<P>醉翁吟（並序嘉祐元年）

<P>餘作醉翁亭於滁州，太常博士沈遵，好奇之士也，聞而往遊焉。愛其山水，歸而以琴寫之，作《醉翁吟》三疊。去年秋，餘奉使契丹，沈君會余恩冀之間。
夜闌酒半，援琴而作之，有其聲而無其辭，乃為之辭以贈之。其辭曰：

<P><DIR>琅琊幽谷，山川奇麗，泉鳴空澗，若中音會。醉翁喜之，把酒臨聽，輒欣然忘歸。既去十餘年，而好奇之士沈遵聞之往遊，以琴寫其聲，曰《醉翁操》，節奏疏宕，而音指華暢，知琴者以為絕倫。然有其聲而無其辭。翁踓為作歌，而與琴聲不合。又依《楚辭》作《醉翁引》，好事者亦倚其辭以製曲。踓粗合韻度，而琴聲為詞所繩約，非天成也。後三十餘年，翁既捐館舍，遵亦沒久矣。有廬山玉澗道人崔閒，特妙於琴。恨此曲之無詞，乃譜其聲，而請東坡居士以補之云。（<A HREF="#chilyr">見下</A>）

<P><A NAME="marnix"><A NAME="f16"><B>16.</B></A> 
At the 1998 <A HREF="http://home.planet.nl/~chime/">CHIME</A> conference in Prague Marnix Wells presented a paper trying to connect the poems by Ouyang Xiu and later Su Dongpo, discussed above. Wells suggested that the <I>Qinyuan Yaolu</I> essay prescribes an isorhythm of 13 beats:

<DIR><P>  v v v v v v v 　v v v (? I did not fully understand this)

</DIR><P>This accords with a possible reading of the article, and Wells supported his interpretation as follows (see also the original text of the poem, below).

<DIR>Su Shi's poem has 39 characters for the first verse and 52 for the second. Some versions suggest Su Shi's first verse be repeated in harmonics, making 39+39+52=130 characters. Ouyang Xiu's poem has 129 characters, so if an extra character can be added somewhere, it could also be made to fit the same  isorhythm.</DIR>

<P>Unfortunately, the isorhythm goes completely against any possible grammatical phrasing of either poem, and in particular it ignores both the parallel structures in Ouyang Xiu's poem, and the fact that the structure he used was (or became) a <A HREF="../../05poet/qinci.htm#mcgill"><I>ci</I> pattern</A>. It also does not accord with any rhythms naturally implied by the fingering of the version here in <I>Fengxuan Xuanpin</I>.
