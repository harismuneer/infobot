<H1>Bibliography of Works Consulted</H1></center>

This is a master listing of works consulted in my research on American Forts of the Southeastern United States.  Additional information was gathered from many third-party websites, which will not be listed here.  Websites are linked within the actual fort listings, or on the seperate LINKS page.  Additional information and material was also sent in by email and regular postal from many people around the country, and is noted as such within the actual fort listings.<BR>
<BR>
Where a certain source was used for more than one state, it will be listed here only once, either under GENERAL REFERENCES, or under the first (or major) state referenced.  <FONT COLOR="blue">Citations in blue indicate library sources that are not in my personal collection.</FONT>
