      College<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></b></p>
      <p>In order to appreciate the reasons for the Electoral College, it is
      essential to understand its historical context and the problem that the
      Founding Fathers were trying to solve. They faced the difficult question
      of how to elect a president in a nation that:</p>
      <p align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><span style="color:navy">Origins
      of the Electoral College<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></b></p>
      <p>The Constitutional Convention considered several possible methods of
      selecting a president.</p>
      <p>One idea was to have the Congress choose the president. This idea was
      rejected, however, because some felt that making such a choice would be
      too divisive an issue and leave too many hard feelings in the Congress.
      Others felt that such a procedure would invite unseemly political
      bargaining, corruption, and perhaps even interference from foreign powers.
      Still others felt that such an arrangement would upset the balance of
      power between the legislative and executive branches of the federal
      government.</p>
      <p>A second idea was to have the State legislatures select the president.
      This idea, too, was rejected out of fears that a president so beholden to
      the State legislatures might permit them to erode federal authority and
      thus undermine the whole idea of a federation.</p>
      <p>A third idea was to have the president elected by a direct popular
      vote. Direct election was rejected not because the Framers of the
      Constitution doubted public intelligence but rather because they feared
      that without sufficient information about candidates from outside their
      State, people would naturally vote for a &quot;favorite son&quot; from
      their own State or region. At worst, no president would emerge with a
      popular majority sufficient to govern the whole country. At best, the
      choice of president would always be decided by the largest, most populous
      States with little regard for the smaller ones.</p>
      <p>Finally, a so-called &quot;Committee of Eleven&quot; in the
      Constitutional Convention proposed an indirect election of the president
      through a College of Electors.</p>
      <p align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><span style="color:navy">The
      First Design<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></b></p>
      <p>In the first design of the Electoral College (described in Article II,
      Section 1 of the Constitution):</p>
      <p>Each State was allocated a number of Electors equal to the number of
      its U.S. Senators (always 2) plus the number of its U.S. Representatives
      (which may change each decade according to the size of each State&#8217;s
      population as determined in the decennial census). This arrangement built
      upon an earlier compromise in the design of the Congress itself and thus
      satisfied both large and small States.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The manner of choosing the Electors was left to the individual State
          legislatures, thereby pacifying States suspicious of a central
          national government.</li>
        <li>Members of Congress and employees of the federal government were
          specifically prohibited from serving as an Elector in order to
          maintain the balance between the legislative and executive branches of
          the federal government.</li>
        <li>Each State&#8217;s Electors were required to meet in their respective
          States rather than all together in one great meeting. This
          arrangement, it was thought, would prevent bribery, corruption, secret
          dealing, and foreign influence.</li>
        <li>In order to prevent Electors from voting only for a &quot;favorite
          son&quot; of their own State, each Elector was required to cast two
          votes for president, at least one of which had to be for someone
          outside their home State. The idea, presumably, was that the winner
          would likely be everyone&#8217;s second favorite choice.</li>
        <li>The electoral votes were to be sealed and transmitted from each of
          the States to the President of the Senate who would then open them
          before both houses of the Congress and read the results. n The person
          with the most electoral votes, provided that it was an absolute
          majority (at least one over half of the total), became president.
          Whoever obtained the next greatest number of electoral votes became
          vice president&#8212;an office which they seem to have invented for the
          occasion since it had not been mentioned previously in the
          Constitutional Convention.</li>
        <li>In the event that no one obtained an absolute majority in the
          Electoral College or in the event of a tie vote, the U.S. House of
          Representatives, as the chamber closest to the people, would choose
          the president from among the top five contenders. They would do this
          (as a further concession to the small States) by allowing each State
          to cast only one vote with an absolute majority of the States being
          required to elect a president. The vice presidency would go to
          whatever remaining contender had the greatest number of electoral
          votes. If that, too, was tied, the U.S. Senate would break the tie by
          deciding between the two.</li>
      </ul>
      <p align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><span style="color:navy">The
      Second Design<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></b></p>
      <p>The first design of the Electoral College lasted through only four
      presidential elections. For in the meantime, political parties had emerged
      in the United States. The very people who had been condemning parties
      publicly had nevertheless been building them privately. And too, the idea
      of political parties had gained respectability through the persuasive
      writings of such political philosophers as Edmund Burke and James Madison.</p>
      <p>One of the accidental results of the development of political parties
      was that in the presidential election of 1800, the Electors of the
      Democratic-Republican Party gave Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr (both of
      that party) an equal number of electoral votes. The tie was resolved by
      the House of Representatives in Jefferson&#8217;s favor&#8212;but only after 36
      tries and some serious political dealings which were considered unseemly
      at the time. Since this sort of bargaining over the presidency was the
      very thing the Electoral College was supposed to prevent, the Congress and
      the States hastily adopted the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution by
      September of 1804.</p>
      <p>To prevent tie votes in the Electoral College which were made probable,
      if not inevitable, by the rise of political parties (and no doubt to
      facilitate the election of a president and vice president of the same
      party), the 12<sup>th</sup> Amendment requires that each Elector cast one
      vote for president and a separate vote for vice president rather than
      casting two votes for president with the runner-up being made vice
      president. The Amendment also stipulates that if no one receives an
      absolute majority of electoral votes for president, then the U.S. House of
      Representatives will select the president from among the top three
      contenders with each State casting only one vote and an absolute majority
      being required to elect. By the same token, if no one receives an absolute
      majority for vice president, then the U.S. Senate will select the vice
      president from among the top two contenders for that office. All other
      features of the Electoral College remained the same including the
      requirement that, in order to prevent Electors from voting only for
      &quot;favorite sons&quot;, either the presidential or vice presidential
      candidate has to be from a State other than that of the Electors.</p>
      <p>In short, political party loyalties had, by 1800, begun to cut across
      State loyalties thereby creating new and different problems in the
      selection of a president. By making seemingly slight changes, the 12<sup>th</sup>
      Amendment fundamentally altered the design of the Electoral College and,
      in one stroke, accommodated political parties as a fact of life in
      American presidential elections.</p>
      <p>It is noteworthy in passing that the idea of electing the president by
      direct popular vote was not widely promoted as an alternative to
      redesigning the Electoral College. This may be because the physical and
      demographic circumstances of the country had not changed that much in a
      dozen or so years. Or it may be because the excesses of the recent French
      revolution (and its fairly rapid degeneration into dictatorship) had given
      the populists some pause to reflect on the wisdom of too direct a
      democracy.</p>

mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:navy">The Evolution of the Electoral College<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></b></p>
      <p>Since the 12<sup>th</sup> Amendment, there have been several federal
      and State statutory changes which have affected both the time and manner
      of choosing Presidential Electors but which have not further altered the
      fundamental workings of the Electoral College. There have also been a few
      curious incidents which its critics cite as problems but which proponents
      of the Electoral College view as merely its natural and intended
      operation.</p>
      <p align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><span style="color:navy">The
      Manner of Choosing Electors<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></b></p>
      <p>From the outset, and to this day, the manner of choosing its State&#8217;s
      Electors was left to each State legislature. And initially, as one might
      expect, different States adopted different methods.</p>
      <p>Some State legislatures decided to choose the Electors themselves.
      Others decided on a direct popular vote for Electors either by
      Congressional district or at large throughout the whole State. Still
      others devised some combination of these methods. But in all cases,
      Electors were chosen individually from a single list of all candidates for
      the position.</p>
      <p>During the 1800&#8217;s, two trends in the States altered and more or less
      standardized the manner of choosing Electors. The first trend was toward
      choosing Electors by the direct popular vote of the whole State (rather
      than by the State legislature or by the popular vote of each Congressional
      district). Indeed, by 1836, all States had moved to choosing their
      Electors by a direct statewide popular vote except South Carolina which
      persisted in choosing them by the State legislature until 1860. Today, all
      States choose their Electors by direct statewide election except Maine
      (which in 1969) and Nebraska (which in 1991) changed to selecting two of
      its Electors by a statewide popular vote and the remainder by the popular
      vote in each Congressional district.</p>
      <p>Along with the trend toward their direct statewide election came the
      trend toward what is called the &quot;winner-take-all&quot; system of
      choosing Electors. Under the winner-take-all system, the presidential
      candidate who wins the most popular votes within a State wins all of that
      State&#8217;s Electors. This winner-take-all system was really the logical
      consequence of the direct statewide vote for Electors owing to the
      influence of political parties. For in a direct popular election, voters
      loyal to one political party&#8217;s candidate for president would naturally
      vote for that party&#8217;s list of proposed Electors. By the same token,
      political parties would propose only as many Electors as there were
      electoral votes in the State so as not to fragment their support and thus
      permit the victory of another party&#8217;s Elector.</p>
      <p>There arose, then, the custom that each political party would, in each
      State, offer a &quot;slate of Electors&quot;&#8212;a list of individuals loyal
      to their candidate for president and equal in number to that State&#8217;s
      electoral vote. The voters of each State would then vote for each
      individual listed in the slate of whichever party&#8217;s candidate they
      preferred. Yet the business of presenting separate party slates of
      individuals occasionally led to confusion. Some voters divided their votes
      between party lists because of personal loyalties to the individuals
      involved rather than according to their choice for president. Other
      voters, either out of fatigue or confusion, voted for fewer than the
      entire party list. The result, especially in close elections, was the
      occasional splitting of a State&#8217;s electoral vote. This happened as late
      as 1916 in West Virginia when seven Republican Electors and one Democrat
      Elector won.</p>
      <p align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><span style="color:navy">The
      Time of Choosing Electors<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></b></p>
      <p>The time for choosing Electors has undergone a similar evolution. For
      while the Constitution specifically gives to the Congress the power to
      &quot;determine the Time of choosing the Electors&quot;, the Congress at
      first gave some latitude to the States.</p>
      <p>For the first fifty years of the Federation, Congress permitted the
      States to conduct their presidential elections (or otherwise to choose
      their Electors) anytime in a 34 day period before the first Wednesday of
      December which was the day set for the meeting of the Electors in their
      respective States. The problems born of such an arrangement are obvious
      and were intensified by improved communications. For the States which
      voted later could swell, diminish, or be influenced by a candidate&#8217;s
      victories in the States which voted earlier. In close elections, the
      States which voted last might well determine the outcome. (And it is
      perhaps for this reason that South Carolina, always among the last States
      to choose its Electors, maintained for so long its tradition of choosing
      them by the State legislature. In close elections, the South Carolina
      State legislature might well decide the presidency!).</p>
      <p>The Congress, in 1845, therefore adopted a uniform day on which the
      States were to choose their Electors. That day&#8212;the Tuesday following the
      first Monday in November in years divisible by four&#8212;continues to be the
      day on which all the States now conduct their presidential elections.</p>
      <p align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><span style="color:navy">Historical
      Curiosities<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></b></p>
      <p>In the evolution of the Electoral College, there have been some
      interesting developments and remarkable outcomes. Critics often try to use
      these as examples of what can go wrong. Yet most of these historical
      curiosities were the result of profound political divisions within the
      country which the designers of the Electoral College system seem to have
      anticipated as needing resolution at a higher level.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In 1800, as previously noted, the Democratic-Republican Electors
          gave both Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr an equal number of electoral
          votes. The tie, settled in Jefferson&#8217;s favor by the House of
          Representatives in accordance with the original design of the
          Electoral College system, prompted the 12<sup>th</sup> Amendment which
          effectively prevented this sort of thing from ever happening again.</li>
        <li>In 1824, there were four fairly strong contenders in the
          presidential contest (Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, William
          Crawford, and Henry Clay) each of whom represented an important
          faction within the now vastly dominant Democratic-Republican Party.
          The electoral votes were so divided amongst them that no one received
          the necessary majority to become president (although the popular John
          C. Calhoun did receive enough electoral votes to become vice
          president). In accordance with the provisions of the 12<sup>th</sup>
          Amendment, the choice of president devolved upon the House of
          Representatives who narrowly selected John Quincy Adams despite the
          fact that Andrew Jackson had obtained the greater number of electoral
          votes. This election is often cited as the first one in which the
          candidate who obtained the greatest popular vote (Jackson) failed to
          be elected president. The claim is a weak one, though, since six of
          the 24 States at the time still chose their Electors in the State
          legislature. Some of these (such as sizable New York) would likely
          have returned large majorities for Adams had they conducted a popular
          election.</li>
        <li>The 1836 presidential election was a truly strange event. The
          developing Whig Party, for example, decided to run three different
          presidential candidates (William Henry Harrison, Daniel Webster, and
          Hugh White) in separate parts of the country. The idea was that their
          respective regional popularities would ensure a Whig majority in the
          Electoral College which would then decide on a single Whig
          presidential ticket. This fairly inspired scheme failed, though, when
          Democratic-Republican candidate Martin Van Buren won an absolute
          majority of Electors. Nor has such a strategy ever again been
          seriously attempted. Yet Van Buren himself did not escape the event
          entirely unscathed. For while he obtained an electoral majority, his
          vice presidential running mate (one Richard Johnson) was considered so
          objectionable by some of the Democratic-Republican Electors that he
          failed to obtain the necessary majority of electoral votes to become
          vice president. In accordance with the 12<sup>th</sup> Amendment, the
          decision devolved upon the Senate which chose Johnson as vice
          president anyway. A really bizarre election, that one.</li>
        <li>In the 1872 election, Democratic candidate Horace Greeley (he of
          earlier &quot;Go West, young man, go West&quot; journalistic fame
          whose nomination makes a good story in itself) thoughtlessly died
          during that period between the popular vote for Electors and the
          meeting of the Electoral College. The Electors who were pledged to
          him, clearly unprepared for such an eventuality, split their electoral
          votes amongst several other Democratic candidates (including three
          votes for Greeley himself as a possible comment on the incumbent
          Ulysses S. Grant). That hardly mattered, though, since the Republican
          Grant had readily won an absolute majority of Electors. Still, it was
          an interesting event for which the political parties are now prepared.</li>
        <li>In 1876, the country once again found itself in serious political
          turmoil echoing, in some respects, both the economic divisions of 1824
          and the impending political party realignments of 1836, but with the
          added bitterness of Reconstruction. A number of deep cross currents
          were in play. After a vast economic expansion, the country had fallen
          into a deep depression. Monetary and tariff issues were eroding the
          Union Republican coalition of East and West while a solid Republican
          black vote eroded the traditional Democratic hold on the South. The
          incumbent Republican administration of Grant had suffered a seemingly
          endless series of scandals involving graft and corruption on a scale
          hitherto unknown. And the South was eager to put an end to Radical
          Reconstruction which was, after all, a kind of vast political mugging.
          Against this backdrop, the resurging Democratic Party easily nominated
          Samuel J. Tilden, the popular Governor of New York, and Thomas A.
          Hendricks of Indiana (shrewd geographic choices under the
          circumstances). The Republicans, in a more turbulent convention,
          selected Ohio Governor Rutherford B. Hayes and William A. Wheeler of
          New York. A variety of fairly significant third parties also cropped
          up, further shattering the country&#8217;s political cohesion.</li>
        <li>This is about as good a prescription for electoral chaos as anyone
          might hope for. Indeed, it is almost surprising that things did not
          turn out worse than they did. For on election night, it looked as
          though Tilden had pulled off the first Democratic presidential victory
          since the Civil War&#8212;although the decisive electoral votes of South
          Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana remained in balance. Yet these States
          were as divided internally as was the nation at large. Without
          detailing the machinations of the vote count, suffice it to say that
          each State finally delivered to the Congress two sets of electoral
          votes&#8212;one set for Tilden and one set for Hayes. Because the
          Congressional procedures for resolving disputed sets of Electors had
          expired, the Congress established a special 15-member commission to
          decide the issue in each of the three States. After much partisan
          intrigue, the special commission decided (by one vote in each case) on
          Hayes&#8217; Electors from all three States. Thus, Hayes was elected
          president despite the fact that Tilden, by everyone&#8217;s count, had
          obtained a slight majority of popular votes (although the difference
          was a mere 3% of the total vote cast). As a final note, the Congress
          enacted in 1887 legislation that delegated to each State the final
          authority to determine the legality of its choice of Electors and
          required a concurrent majority of both houses of Congress to reject
          any electoral vote. That legislation remains in effect to this day so
          that the events of 1876 will not repeat themselves.</li>
        <li>Benjamin Harrison&#8217;s election in 1888 is really the only clear-cut
          instance in which the Electoral College vote went contrary to the
          popular vote. This happened because the incumbent, Democrat Grover
          Cleveland, ran up huge popular majorities in several of the 18 States
          which supported him while the Republican challenger, Benjamin
          Harrison, won only slender majorities in some of the larger of the 20
          States which supported him (most notably in Cleveland&#8217;s home State
          of New York). Even so, the difference between them was only 110,476
          votes out of 11,381,032 cast&#8212;less than 1% of the total.
          Interestingly, in this case, there were few critical issues (other
          than tariffs) separating the candidates so that the election seems to
          have been fought&#8212;and won&#8212;more on the basis of superior party
          organization in getting out the vote than on the issues of the day.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These, then, are the major historical curiosities of the Electoral
      College system. And because they are so frequently cited as flaws in the
      system, a few observations on them seem in order.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>First, all of these events occurred over a century ago. For the past
          hundred years, the Electoral College has functioned without incident
          in every presidential election through two world wars, a major
          economic depression, and several periods of acute civil unrest. Only
          twice in this century (the States&#8217; Rights Democrats in 1948 and
          George Wallace&#8217;s American Independents in 1968) have there been
          attempts to block an Electoral College victory and thus either force a
          negotiation for the presidency or else force the decision into the
          Congress. Neither attempt came close to succeeding. Such stability,
          rare in human history, should not be lightly dismissed.</li>
        <li>Second, each of these events (except 1888) resulted either from
          political inexperience (as in 1800, 1836, and 1872) or from profound
          political divisions within the country (as in 1824, 1876, and even
          1948 and 1968) which required some sort of higher order political
          resolution. And all of them were resolved in a peaceable and orderly
          fashion without any public uprising and without endangering the
          legitimacy of the sitting president. Indeed, it is hard to imagine how
          a direct election of the president could have resolved events as
          agreeably.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Finally, as the election of 1888 demonstrates, the Electoral College
      system imposes two requirements on candidates for the presidency:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>that the victor obtain a sufficient popular vote to enable him to
          govern (although this may not be the absolute majority), and</li>
        <li>that such a popular vote be sufficiently distributed across the
          country to enable him to govern.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Such an arrangement ensures a regional balance of support which is a
      vital consideration in governing a large and diverse nation (even though
      in close elections, as in 1888, distribution of support may take
      precedence over majority of support).</p>
      <p>Far from being flaws, then, the historical oddities described above
      demonstrate the strength and resilience of the Electoral College system in
      being able to select a president in even the most troubled of times.</p>

mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;color:navy">Current Workings of the Electoral College<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></b></p>
      <p><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The current workings of
      the Electoral College are the result of both design and experience. As it
      now operates:</p>
      <p>Each State is allocated a number of Electors equal to the number of its
      U.S. Senators (always 2) plus the number of its U.S. Representatives
      (which may change each decade according to the size of each State&#8217;s
      population as determined in the Census).</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The political parties (or independent candidates) in each State
          submit to the State&#8217;s chief election official a list of individuals
          pledged to their candidate for president and equal in number to the
          State&#8217;s electoral vote. Usually, the major political parties select
          these individuals either in their State party conventions or through
          appointment by their State party leaders while third parties and
          independent candidates merely designate theirs.</li>
        <li>Members of Congress and employees of the federal government are
          prohibited from serving as an Elector in order to maintain the balance
          between the legislative and executive branches of the federal
          government.</li>
        <li>After their caucuses and primaries, the major parties nominate their
          candidates for president and vice president in their national
          conventions&#8212;traditionally held in the summer preceding the election.
          (Third parties and independent candidates follow different procedures
          according to the individual State laws). The names of the duly
          nominated candidates are then officially submitted to each State&#8217;s
          chief election official so that they might appear on the general
          election ballot.</li>
        <li>On the Tuesday following the first Monday of November in years
          divisible by four, the people in each State cast their ballots for the
          party slate of Electors representing their choice for president and
          vice president (although as a matter of practice, general election
          ballots normally say &quot;Electors for&quot; each set of candidates
          rather than list the individual Electors on each slate).</li>
        <li>Whichever party slate wins the most popular votes in the State
          becomes that State&#8217;s Electors&#8212;so that, in effect, whichever
          presidential ticket gets the most popular votes in a State wins all
          the Electors of that State. [The two exceptions to this are Maine and
          Nebraska where two Electors are chosen by statewide popular vote and
          the remainder by the popular vote within each Congressional district].</li>
        <li>On the Monday following the second Wednesday of December (as
          established in federal law) each State&#8217;s Electors meet in their
          respective State capitals and cast their electoral votes&#8212;one for
          president and one for vice president.</li>
        <li>In order to prevent Electors from voting only for &quot;favorite
          sons&quot; of their home State, at least one of their votes must be
          for a person from outside their State (though this is seldom a problem
          since the parties have consistently nominated presidential and vice
          presidential candidates from different States).</li>
        <li>The electoral votes are then sealed and transmitted from each State
          to the President of the Senate who, on the following January 6, opens
          and reads them before both houses of the Congress.</li>
        <li>The candidate for president with the most electoral votes, provided
          that it is an absolute majority (one over half of the total), is
          declared president. Similarly, the vice presidential candidate with
          the absolute majority of electoral votes is declared vice president.</li>
        <li>In the event no one obtains an absolute majority of electoral votes
          for president, the U.S. House of Representatives (as the chamber
          closest to the people) selects the president from among the top three
          contenders with each State casting only one vote and an absolute
          majority of the States being required to elect. Similarly, if no one
          obtains an absolute majority for vice president, then the U.S. Senate
          makes the selection from among the top two contenders for that office.</li>
        <li>At noon on January 20, the duly elected president and vice president
          are sworn into office.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Occasionally questions arise about what would happen if the
      presidential or vice presidential candidate died at some point in this
      process. For answers to these, as well as to a number of other &quot;what
      if&quot; questions, readers are advised to consult a small volume entitled
      After the People Vote: Steps in Choosing the President edited by Walter
      Berns and published in 1983 by the American Enterprise Institute.
      Similarly, further details on the history and current functioning of the
      Electoral College are available in the second edition of Congressional
      Quarterly&#8217;s Guide to U.S. Elections, a real goldmine of information,
      maps, and statistics.</p>

      </o:p>
      </span></b></p>
      <p>There have, in its 200-year history, been a number of critics and
      proposed reforms to the Electoral College system&#8212;most of them trying to
      eliminate it. But there are also staunch defenders of the Electoral
      College who, though perhaps less vocal than its critics, offer very
      powerful arguments in its favor.</p>
      <p align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><span style="color:navy">Arguments
      Against the Electoral College<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></b></p>
      <p>Those who object to the Electoral College system and favor a direct
      popular election of the president generally do so on four grounds:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the possibility of electing a minority president</li>
        <li>the risk of so-called &quot;faithless&quot; Electors,</li>
        <li>the possible role of the Electoral College in depressing voter
          turnout, and</li>
        <li>its failure to accurately reflect the national popular will.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Opponents of the Electoral College are disturbed by the possibility of
      electing a minority president (one without the absolute majority of
      popular votes). Nor is this concern entirely unfounded since there are
      three ways in which that could happen.</p>
      <p>One way in which a minority president could be elected is if the
      country were so deeply divided politically that three or more presidential
      candidates split the electoral votes among them such that no one obtained
      the necessary majority. This occurred, as noted above, in 1824 and was
      unsuccessfully attempted in 1948 and again in 1968. Should that happen
      today, there are two possible resolutions: either one candidate could
      throw his electoral votes to the support of another (before the meeting of
      the Electors) or else, absent an absolute majority in the Electoral
      College, the U.S. House of Representatives would select the president in
      accordance with the 12<sup>th</sup> Amendment. Either way, though, the
      person taking office would not have obtained the absolute majority of the
      popular vote. Yet it is unclear how a direct election of the president
      could resolve such a deep national conflict without introducing a
      presidential run-off election&#8212;a procedure which would add substantially
      to the time, cost, and effort already devoted to selecting a president and
      which might well deepen the political divisions while trying to resolve
      them.</p>
      <p>A second way in which a minority president could take office is if, as
      in 1888, one candidate&#8217;s popular support were heavily concentrated in a
      few States while the other candidate maintained a slim popular lead in
      enough States to win the needed majority of the Electoral College. While
      the country has occasionally come close to this sort of outcome, the
      question here is whether the distribution of a candidate&#8217;s popular
      support should be taken into account alongside the relative size of it.
      This issue was mentioned above and is discussed at greater length below.</p>
      <p>A third way of electing a minority president is if a third party or
      candidate, however small, drew enough votes from the top two that no one
      received over 50% of the national popular total. Far from being unusual,
      this sort of thing has, in fact, happened 15 times including (in this
      century) Wilson in both 1912 and 1916, Truman in 1948, Kennedy in 1960,
      Nixon in 1968, and Clinton in both 1992 and in 1996. The only remarkable
      thing about those outcomes is that few people noticed and even fewer
      cared. Nor would a direct election have changed those outcomes without a
      run-off requiring over 50% of the popular vote (an idea which not even
      proponents of a direct election seem to advocate).</p>
      <p>Opponents of the Electoral College system also point to the risk of
      so-called &quot;faithless&quot; Electors. A &quot;faithless Elector&quot;
      is one who is pledged to vote for his party&#8217;s candidate for president
      but nevertheless votes for another candidate. There have been 7 such
      Electors in this century and as recently as 1988 when a Democrat Elector
      in the State of West Virginia cast his votes for Lloyd Bensen for
      president and Michael Dukakis for vice president instead of the other way
      around. Faithless Electors have never changed the outcome of an election,
      though, simply because most often their purpose is to make a statement
      rather than make a difference. That is to say, when the electoral vote
      outcome is so obviously going to be for one candidate or the other, an
      occasional Elector casts a vote for some personal favorite knowing full
      well that it will not make a difference in the result. Still, if the
      prospect of a faithless Elector is so fearsome as to warrant a
      Constitutional amendment, then it is possible to solve the problem without
      abolishing the Electoral College merely by eliminating the individual
      Electors in favor of a purely mathematical process (since the individual
      Electors are no longer essential to its operation).</p>
      <p>Opponents of the Electoral College are further concerned about its
      possible role in depressing voter turnout. Their argument is that, since
      each State is entitled to the same number of electoral votes regardless of
      its voter turnout, there is no incentive in the States to encourage voter
      participation. Indeed, there may even be an incentive to discourage
      participation (and they often cite the South here) so as to enable a
      minority of citizens to decide the electoral vote for the whole State.
      While this argument has a certain surface plausibility, it fails to
      account for the fact that presidential elections do not occur in a vacuum.
      States also conduct other elections (for U.S. Senators, U.S.
      Representatives, State Governors, State legislators, and a host of local
      officials) in which these same incentives and disincentives are likely to
      operate, if at all, with an even greater force. It is hard to imagine what
      counter-incentive would be created by eliminating the Electoral College.</p>
      <p>Finally, some opponents of the Electoral College point out, quite
      correctly, its failure to accurately reflect the national popular will in
      at least two respects.</p>
      <p>First, the distribution of Electoral votes in the College tends to
      over-represent people in rural States. This is because the number of
      Electors for each State is determined by the number of members it has in
      the House (which more or less reflects the State&#8217;s population size) plus
      the number of members it has in the Senate (which is always two regardless
      of the State&#8217;s population). The result is that in 1988, for example, the
      combined voting age population (3,119,000) of the seven least populous
      jurisdictions of Alaska, Delaware, the District of Columbia, North Dakota,
      South Dakota, Vermont, and Wyoming carried the same voting strength in the
      Electoral College (21 Electoral votes) as the 9,614,000 persons of voting
      age in the State of Florida. Each Floridian&#8217;s potential vote, then,
      carried about one third the weight of a potential vote in the other States
      listed.</p>
      <p>A second way in which the Electoral College fails to accurately reflect
      the national popular will stems primarily from the winner-take-all
      mechanism whereby the presidential candidate who wins the most popular
      votes in the State wins all the Electoral votes of that State. One effect
      of this mechanism is to make it extremely difficult for third-party or
      independent candidates ever to make much of a showing in the Electoral
      College. If, for example, a third-party or independent candidate were to
      win the support of even as many as 25% of the voters nationwide, he might
      still end up with no Electoral College votes at all unless he won a
      plurality of votes in at least one State. And even if he managed to win a
      few States, his support elsewhere would not be reflected. By thus failing
      to accurately reflect the national popular will, the argument goes, the
      Electoral College reinforces a two-party system, discourages third-party
      or independent candidates, and thereby tends to restrict choices available
      to the electorate.</p>
      <p>In response to these arguments, proponents of the Electoral College
      point out that it was never intended to reflect the national popular will.
      As for the first issue, that the Electoral College over-represents rural
      populations, proponents respond that the United States Senate&#8212;with two
      seats per State regardless of its population&#8212;over-represents rural
      populations far more dramatically. But since there have been no serious
      proposals to abolish the United States Senate on these grounds, why should
      such an argument be used to abolish the lesser case of the Electoral
      College? Because the presidency represents the whole country? But so, as
      an institution, does the United States Senate.</p>
      <p>As for the second issue of the Electoral College&#8217;s role in
      reinforcing a two-party system, proponents, as we shall see, find this to
      be a positive virtue.</p>
      <p align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><span style="color:navy">Arguments
      for the Electoral College<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></b></p>
      <p>Proponents of the Electoral College system normally defend it on the
      philosophical grounds that it:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>contributes to the cohesiveness of the country by requiring a
          distribution of popular support to be elected president</li>
        <li>enhances the status of minority interests,</li>
        <li>contributes to the political stability of the nation by encouraging
          a two-party system, and</li>
        <li>maintains a federal system of government and representation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Recognizing the strong regional interests and loyalties which have
      played so great a role in American history, proponents argue that the
      Electoral College system contributes to the cohesiveness of the country by
      requiring a distribution of popular support to be elected president.
      Without such a mechanism, they point out, presidents would be selected
      either through the domination of one populous region over the others or
      through the domination of large metropolitan areas over the rural ones.
      Indeed, it is principally because of the Electoral College that
      presidential nominees are inclined to select vice presidential running
      mates from a region other than their own. For as things stand now, no one
      region contains the absolute majority (270) of electoral votes required to
      elect a president. Thus, there is an incentive for presidential candidates
      to pull together coalitions of States and regions rather than to
      exacerbate regional differences. Such a unifying mechanism seems
      especially prudent in view of the severe regional problems that have
      typically plagued geographically large nations such as China, India, the
      Soviet Union, and even, in its time, the Roman Empire.</p>
      <p>This unifying mechanism does not, however, come without a small price.
      And the price is that in very close popular elections, it is possible that
      the candidate who wins a slight majority of popular votes may not be the
      one elected president&#8212;depending (as in 1888) on whether his popularity
      is concentrated in a few States or whether it is more evenly distributed
      across the States. Yet this is less of a problem than it seems since, as a
      practical matter, the popular difference between the two candidates would
      likely be so small that either candidate could govern effectively.</p>
      <p>Proponents thus believe that the practical value of requiring a
      distribution of popular support outweighs whatever sentimental value may
      attach to obtaining a bare majority of the popular support. Indeed, they
      point out that the Electoral College system is designed to work in a
      rational series of defaults: if, in the first instance, a candidate
      receives a substantial majority of the popular vote, then that candidate
      is virtually certain to win enough electoral votes to be elected
      president; in the event that the popular vote is extremely close, then the
      election defaults to that candidate with the best distribution of popular
      votes (as evidenced by obtaining the absolute majority of electoral
      votes); in the event the country is so divided that no one obtains an
      absolute majority of electoral votes, then the choice of president
      defaults to the States in the U.S. House of Representatives. One way or
      another, then, the winning candidate must demonstrate both a sufficient
      popular support to govern as well as a sufficient distribution of that
      support to govern.</p>
      <p>Proponents also point out that, far from diminishing minority interests
      by depressing voter participation, the Electoral College actually enhances
      the status of minority groups. This is so because the votes of even small
      minorities in a State may make the difference between winning all of that
      State&#8217;s electoral votes or none of that State&#8217;s electoral votes. And
      since ethnic minority groups in the United States happen to concentrate in
      those States with the most electoral votes, they assume an importance to
      presidential candidates well out of proportion to their number. The same
      principle applies to other special interest groups such as labor unions,
      farmers, environmentalists, and so forth.</p>
      <p>It is because of this &quot;leverage effect&quot; that the presidency,
      as an institution, tends to be more sensitive to ethnic minority and other
      special interest groups than does the Congress as an institution. Changing
      to a direct election of the president would therefore actually damage
      minority interests since their votes would be overwhelmed by a national
      popular majority.</p>
      <p>Proponents further argue that the Electoral College contributes to the
      political stability of the nation by encouraging a two-party system. There
      can be no doubt that the Electoral College has encouraged and helps to
      maintain a twoparty system in the United States. This is true simply
      because it is extremely difficult for a new or minor party to win enough
      popular votes in enough States to have a chance of winning the presidency.
      Even if they won enough electoral votes to force the decision into the
      U.S. House of Representatives, they would still have to have a majority of
      over half the State delegations in order to elect their candidate&#8212;and in
      that case, they would hardly be considered a minor party.</p>
      <p>In addition to protecting the presidency from impassioned but
      transitory third party movements, the practical effect of the Electoral
      College (along with the single-member district system of representation in
      the Congress) is to virtually force third party movements into one of the
      two major political parties. Conversely, the major parties have every
      incentive to absorb minor party movements in their continual attempt to
      win popular majorities in the States. In this process of assimilation,
      third party movements are obliged to compromise their more radical views
      if they hope to attain any of their more generally acceptable objectives.
      Thus we end up with two large, pragmatic political parties which tend to
      the center of public opinion rather than dozens of smaller political
      parties catering to divergent and sometimes extremist views. In other
      words, such a system forces political coalitions to occur within the
      political parties rather than within the government.</p>
      <p>A direct popular election of the president would likely have the
      opposite effect. For in a direct popular election, there would be every
      incentive for a multitude of minor parties to form in an attempt to
      prevent whatever popular majority might be necessary to elect a president.
      The surviving candidates would thus be drawn to the regionalist or
      extremist views represented by these parties in hopes of winning the
      run-off election.</p>
      <p>The result of a direct popular election for president, then, would
      likely be a frayed and unstable political system characterized by a
      multitude of political parties and by more radical changes in policies
      from one administration to the next. The Electoral College system, in
      contrast, encourages political parties to coalesce divergent interests
      into two sets of coherent alternatives. Such an organization of social
      conflict and political debate contributes to the political stability of
      the nation.</p>
      <p>Finally, its proponents argue quite correctly that the Electoral
      College maintains a federal system of government and representation. Their
      reasoning is that in a formal federal structure, important political
      powers are reserved to the component States. In the United States, for
      example, the House of Representatives was designed to represent the States
      according to the size of their population. The States are even responsible
      for drawing the district lines for their House seats. The Senate was
      designed to represent each State equally regardless of its population. And
      the Electoral College was designed to represent each State&#8217;s choice for
      the presidency (with the number of each State&#8217;s electoral votes being
      the number of its Senators plus the number of its Representatives). To
      abolish the Electoral College in favor of a nationwide popular election
      for president would strike at the very heart of the federal structure laid
      out in our Constitution and would lead to the nationalization of our
      central government&#8212;to the detriment of the States.</p>
      <p>Indeed, if we become obsessed with government by popular majority as
      the only consideration, should we not then abolish the Senate which
      represents States regardless of population? Should we not correct the
      minor distortions in the House (caused by districting and by guaranteeing
      each State at least one Representative) by changing it to a system of
      proportional representation? This would accomplish &quot;government by
      popular majority&quot; and guarantee the representation of minority
      parties, but it would also demolish our federal system of government. If
      there are reasons to maintain State representation in the Senate and House
      as they exist today, then surely these same reasons apply to the choice of
      president. Why, then, apply a sentimental attachment to popular majorities
      only to the Electoral College?</p>
      <p>The fact is, they argue, that the original design of our federal system
      of government was thoroughly and wisely debated by the Founding Fathers.
      State viewpoints, they decided, are more important than political minority
      viewpoints. And the collective opinion of the individual State populations
      is more important than the opinion of the national population taken as a
      whole. Nor should we tamper with the careful balance of power between the
      national and State governments which the Founding Fathers intended and
      which is reflected in the Electoral College. To do so would fundamentally
      alter the nature of our government and might well bring about consequences
      that even the reformers would come to regret.</p>
