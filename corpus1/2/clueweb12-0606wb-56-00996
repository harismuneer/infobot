          <p align="justify"><font size="3"><br>
                <em>My main &#8220;warning-cry&#8221; concerns itself with the 
                direction of the breed, which many breeders &#8211; many novices 
                &#8211; still subscribe to, a direction that would lead us off 
                the beaten path, far off of our breed goal; toward breed ruin. 
                In all my articles, lectures, and judges reports of the last few 
                years, I have desperately tried to point out that we must cling 
                to the breed standard of the working dog, and I gave reasons why 
                we must do so &#8211; as it was once laid down, as a model of 
                the breed&#8217;s design. I have emphasized over and over again 
                that we should not get overly engrossed in details of outward 
                characteristics, even if they are ever so attractive, when, for 
                the breeding value of the dog, he must be based entirely and decisively 
                upon the totality of hard constitution, good health, endurance, 
                authentic working structure and stable temperament. The vision, 
                the understanding of this standard, is thus sometimes lost. Many 
                young fanciers have unfortunately hardly ever seen correct conformation 
                in respect to these dogs. They become intoxicated with appearance 
                which so often has so little in common with the working dog as 
                he is supposed to be. In this case, the only thing that helps 
                is trusted faith in the system, until one&#8217;s pondering leads 
                to eventual understanding. The belief in what is well meant &#8211; 
                the thoughtful suggestions and guiding principles &#8211; are 
                for the welfare of the breed&#8217;s future.</em></font></p>
              <p align="justify"></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3">These are words which any serious 
                student of our breed should study, and hang on the refrigerator 
                door! They are that important. They were written in 1929 by Max 
                von Stephanitz, the &#8220;father&#8221; of the German shepherd 
                dog. This man is worth listening to. Almost single handedly, and 
                with foresight, dedication and understanding not equaled by any 
                breed founder before or since, he brought the German shepherd 
                from a homely, little known farm dog to become the top working 
                breed of the past several decades.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3">It was done with German discipline 
                and attention to detail until quite recently. And then a serious 
                split occurred; the dogs exhibited at shows begin to be bred along 
                a specific fad, while the &quot;working dogs&quot; continued to 
                be bred to the original standard. While Americans will never embrace 
                the discipline necessary to breed as the European working dog 
                breeder does, still, much can be learned from a study of their 
                successes. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"> The show bred German shepherd 
                dog (GSD) is a mess in America and in Europe. Bred along the system 
                warned about above, these GSDs are laughable caricatures of what 
                the German working dog system produces. So called &quot;show-line&quot; 
                American and European German shepherds are shunned by all in need 
                of serious working dogs. Police departments must import their 
                dogs from working kennels in Europe. The &quot;show-line&quot; 
                German shepherd in America and Europe, has been bred to fad standards 
                &#8211; not the enduring standard &#8211; and now stands as the 
                primary example of how poor breeding can &#8220;split&#8221; a 
                breed.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3">What has this to do with our bulldogs? 
                Everything.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"> Von Stephanitz was a wise man. 
                His primary concern was not only to preserve what he had worked 
                so hard to bring together but also to put in place steps intended 
                to continue to improve the breed far into the future. The German 
                system has worked until very recently, though it too, faces an 
                eternal struggle with faddist as well. Even though two distinct 
                types now exist in Germany, at least the show dogs must earn a 
                working title to be considered for top honors. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3">Because character is seen as much 
                a part of a dog&#8217;s &#8220;conformation&#8221; to standard 
                as physical appearance (as well it should) the German system insists 
                on working titles for all &#8220;champions&#8221; and breeding 
                dogs. There are classes for non-titled dogs, but those dogs are 
                given scant attention and can never obtain the highest honors. 
                But why the Germans continue to produce superior working GSD is 
                so much more than just this intelligent inclusion of character 
                testing of breeding dogs. The primary reason for its success has 
                been a strictly enforced breed standard, and the insertion of 
                &#8220;breed wardens&#8221; into the mix.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"> Consider a world where our bulldogs 
                were judged in a similar fashion to how GSD are judged in Europe. 
                At the Seiger shows (Seiger and Seigerin are the top male and 
                female of the year and dogs which are destined to make an impact 
                on the breed for years to come) there are the usual classes for 
                young dogs, but with a twist. No young dog may earn a &#8220;V&#8221; 
                rating (the highest) only &#8220;SG&#8221; (second best) for the 
                simple reason the dog is not mature. Wins in this class are considered 
                only a way to present a promising young dog to the world and say 
                &#8220;watch for me in the future!&#8221;</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"> So, first off, consider the improvement 
                if no bulldog could obtain a breed championship at the ludicrous 
                age of 6, 7, or 8 months of age. Better yet, no immature dog could 
                be judged worthy of a &#8220;Grand Championship&#8221;. How can 
                one know what the final temperament and conformation of the mature 
                dog will be? You cannot. And to not address that issue is a serious 
                mistake. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"> The OFA will not certify hips 
                on a dog before it is 24 months old&#8212;so how do we reconcile 
                that with a 12 month old &#8220;grand champion&#8221; being used 
                as a stud? The Germans certify hips at one year of age and require 
                good hips for a dog to become a champion. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"> In my opinion, the single best 
                feature of the European fashion dog show is the written critique. 
                Each dog is given a report on what the judge saw that day. It 
                notes the dog&#8217;s size, color, and remarks about strong and 
                weak points. These reports are listed by breeders when advertising 
                studs or puppies. It helps the serious breeder chose a stud or 
                future brood bitch which will compliment or hopefully improve 
                his animals. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"> Imagine for a moment an American 
                pit bull, or American Staffordshire or Staffordshire bull show 
                where each competitor is handed a paper upon which is written 
                the critique of an experienced, dedicated breed expert. Not someone 
                who has written a book, not someone who is an old time dog fighter, 
                not someone who owns a registry, but a person who has proven themselves 
                to be dedicated to that breed and have sound knowledge of correct 
                structure. Someone who has put in their time, studied under other, 
                experienced judges, and proven their knowledge. Imagine those 
                critiques are openly advertised. Hard to imagine, isn&#8217;t 
                it?</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"> Why? Because as Americans, we 
                value our &#8220;freedom&#8221; more than our stewardship of dog 
                breeds. Imagine putting enforcable regulations in place to stop 
                backyard breeders from producing unsound, substandard animals? 
                Something as simple as mandatory microchipping of puppies so dogs 
                in shelters could be traced back to their breeders. When it has 
                been tried, in a very limited way, it has met with hysteria from 
                nearly everyone.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3">American&#8217;s do not want to 
                be told what they may, or may not do. They do not want a breed 
                warden to tell them who to breed to, or which puppies to cull. 
                It is unimaginable. And, because of this, our dog&#8217;s &#8220;type&#8221; 
                is in a crises state.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"> Imagine a world where the &#8220;Seiger&#8221; 
                pit bull must have some working title (weight pull, obedience, 
                you name it), hips rated Good or Excellent by OFA, and a written 
                critique from a legitimate judge handed out. Imagine a show where 
                the judge does not give out simply first, second, third, and leave 
                you wondering if perhaps she thought these dogs the best of a 
                bad lot. The German system allows the judge to rate the dogs. 
                &#8220;VA&#8221; is outstanding&#8212;above excellent quality, 
                &#8220;V&#8221; is excellent, &#8220;SG&#8221; is very good, and 
                from there is goes to &#8220;satisfactory&#8221; and unsatisfactory. 
                And, better yet, within these ratings, the judge can now rate 
                her dogs &#8220;VA1, VA2, V1, V2, etc. What this allows is a complete 
                rating which shows the competitor and the fanciers exactly what 
                she thinks of this dog &#8211; regardless of where it placed in 
                the winnings. So, in a class of 8 animals, you might have results 
                as follows: VA1, V1, V2, V3, V4, V5, SG1, SG2. It is so much more 
                than &#8220;first place&#8221; and &#8220;second place&#8221;. 
                It tells the competitor, &#8216;hey, your dog may have been in 
                second place, but it was still a really worthy animal&#8217;, 
                or, in some cases, where you might see only SG1, SG2, &#8216;hey, 
                there were no really exceptional animals presented to me, and 
                even though you got second place, your dog is not &#8220;V&#8221; 
                worthy&#8217;. Judging like that takes guts. And it produces results.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3">More from Von Stephanitz:</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"><em>As with so many breeds, sport 
                and fad breeding led to more severe evidence of natural traits, 
                and therefore to bad breeding situations that had nothing more 
                in common with working ability. This may seem nice to the faddist, 
                however, for the true lover of Nature, who doesn&#8217;t engage 
                in matters based on eye appeal, it appears as a strange caricature.</em></font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"> <em>Over-sized, massiveness, 
                height, racing ability, straight front or tucked up racing dog 
                body would be for the shepherd an adverse perception leading to 
                the death of the breed. And actually, some of our dogs and especially 
                those who receive applause among the novices resemble the racing 
                dog type in his over-sized, narrowness, tucked up appearance and 
                effemination. The Borzoi, who hunts the wolf on the Russian prairies 
                does not look like this; he is still a correct, rugged fellow. 
                He who looks around at dog shows, pages through dog magazines, 
                will find often enough that there are still a few other breed&#8217;s 
                destinies which are threatened, that is, they are about to step 
                out of their breed type because they are not bred upon a breed 
                goal, but rather upon an imaginary &#8220;beauty concept&#8221;.</em></font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"> Wow. Written in 1929, these words 
                echo hauntingly in the ear of those who have watched the breeding 
                practices of the American pit bull over the past three decades. 
                How true that the show ring and &quot;street sales&quot; are all 
                about fads. In the 1980&#8217;s in response (conscious or not) 
                to the ever increasing size and bulk of some registry's winners, 
                rival registry's took on the opposite look: skinny, tucked up, 
                racy looking little dogs were the fad. The cry was &#8220;athleticism&#8221; 
                but the result was the same as von Stephanitz predicted; the dogs 
                diverged from breed type to satisfy a fad.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"><br>
                Twenty years later, the fad has changed &#8211; as fads always 
                do. This is why it is imperative that a breed standard stay unchanged 
                through the fickle trickle of time. To not do so leads a breed 
                to be swayed back and forth, ever changing, ever at the mercy 
                of faddist breeders.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"><br>
                Today we see the opposite fad. In small part due to interest in 
                weight pulling, in large part due to the typical American &#8220;bigger 
                is better&#8221; mind set, the breed is now threatened by those 
                who breed massive, faulty structured and over-built animals which 
                more closely resemble a lame mastiff or show type English bulldog 
                than a working pit bulldog. The standards call for a &#8220;medium&#8221; 
                dog&#8212;not overdone in any area. But &#8220;medium&#8221; is 
                not exciting. It is not sexy. And it does not attract the novice 
                buyer. So, fad breeders advertise dogs with incorrect extremes 
                as if they were somehow better than dogs which meet the standard. 
                &#8220;Widest!&#8221; &#8220;Shortest&#8221; &#8220;Biggest&#8221; 
                &#8220;Biggest head!&#8221; These &quot;breeder&#8217;s&quot; 
                ads are shouting from the rooftops: &#8220;There is nothing &#8216;medium&#8217; 
                about my dogs! They are bred strictly for fad. Their shoulders, 
                rears, and size render them incapable of any meaningful work, 
                but I don&#8217;t care; to hell with the standard - I am making 
                money!&#8221;</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3">What is &#8220;Type&#8221;?</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3">Type has two meanings. First, 
                type is what makes an American Staffordshire an American Staffordshire, 
                and not a golden retriever. That is breed type. Second, there 
                is a more subtle type, that which marks dogs of a well established 
                line. For instance, the dedicated fancier may well be able to 
                look at a dog and say, &#8220;She is from the White Rock line&#8221;, 
                or &#8220;That looks like a Fraja dog&#8221;. That would be identifying 
                line type.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3">In a world full of backyard and 
                short term &quot;breeders&quot;, breed type suffers, and line 
                type is almost impossible to find. Can a person who buys two or 
                three dogs, puts up a website, breeds three or four litters be 
                called a &#8220;breeder&#8221;. No. These folks are, almost without 
                exception, out of the breed and onto a new scheme to make money 
                within three to five years. If you doubt it, take a look at the 
                ads in a pit bull magazine from five years ago, and see how many 
                are still around.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"> Dog World magazine used to be 
                an interesting place to keep tabs on long term breeders. Through 
                the fifties, sixties and seventies, you would see consistent ads 
                from breeders who were staying the course. They were always there, 
                month after month, year after year. These were the breeders who, 
                for the most part, developed dogs with line type. Pick up Dog 
                World today and you see a very different picture. It has become 
                a tragic showcase of fad breeders and puppy mills. Each American 
                pit bull ad screams louder than the next &#8220;My dogs are not 
                medium working dogs! My dogs are cripples, but they look cool. 
                I&#8217;m proud my dogs don&#8217;t meet the standard! I am here 
                today to breed for fad size, fad color, fad stockiness, and I 
                don&#8217;t care! I will do what I want despite the damage to 
                the breed.&#8221; </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"> At a show today, be it AKC, UKC 
                or ADBA, you will see a huge variation of breed type. Many people 
                think this is fine, and that it represents a mythical &#8220;variety 
                of type&#8221; from which the breed was founded. They will cite 
                examples such as Colby&#8217;s Pincher, who was a large dog at 
                a pit weight of 56 pounds, and Colby&#8217;s Spring who fought 
                at 22 pounds.(1) Variation in type is certainly to be expected 
                when a breed first comes to have a standard formulated. And, the 
                legitimate written standard of the day &#8211; and to this day 
                &#8211; give room to the fancier for variation in size, and line 
                type, but not in breed type. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"><br>
                For instance, a Sorrells linebred pit bull placed beside a White 
                Rock linebred Am Staff, would both show differences in breed type; 
                they are, after all, today two separate breeds. However, <em>they 
                would both be recognizable as fitting within the original written 
                standard. </em>They would both be &#8220;medium&#8221; in structure, 
                showing an athletic and supple body. They would both fit within 
                the minimum, maximum weight standard. Their forelegs and hindlegs 
                would fit the proportions outlined in both AKC and UKC standards. 
                Their necks would be strong and supple, not overly short and thick. 
                Both dogs would also display line type, which is made up of both 
                the good points and poor points that any line will display. There 
                would be no doubt in any educated observer&#8217;s mind which 
                dog was which, and it is this variation in type which is acceptable 
                and even admirable to have within purebred dogs. It keeps things 
                interesting. And, the breeds are not harmed.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"><br>
                There is room for the correctly built 35 pound pit bull. There 
                is room for the correctly built 65 pound pit bull. There is <em>no 
                room</em> for dogs which are intentionally bred with disregard 
                for the standard. There is even less need for any registry which 
                changes its standards for the whim of fads, or worse, for the 
                sake of sucking in money from the very people whose callous disregard 
                for the stewardship of the breed damage our dogs so.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"><br>
                Speaking of type in regards to the judging of German shepherd 
                dogs, Ricardo Carbajal, Chairman of the USA Breed Advisory Committee 
                stated: &#8220;When referring to breed type the main characteristics 
                in question are harmony and proportion. These must always follow 
                the standard and be in total balance. Anything that tends to be 
                exaggeration violates type and must be penalized. It is the emphasis 
                on these exaggerations such as excessive rear angulation or size 
                that lead many top German breeders to conclude that &#8216;American&#8217;s 
                don&#8217;t know what type is.&#8217;&#8221;</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"><br>
                How sadly true for all breeds. When breed and all breed magazines 
                carry ads displaying dogs which do not resemble breed type, how 
                can the novice learn what is correct? When registries change their 
                standards to include animals different from what was ever intended 
                by breed founders, how can the novice know what is correct? When 
                judges refuse to withhold ribbons, and worse, put up unsound, 
                shy, and untypey animals, how can the breed be saved?</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"><br>
                There have been sporadic attempts to come up with breed suitability 
                tests, working registries, and other ideas which would help. Sadly, 
                all have failed to take hold. There is not enough interest from 
                breeders; not enough interest in stewarding our breeds through 
                to the next generations as the founders wanted them. The current 
                generation must never assume they are wise enough, or experienced 
                enough, to change a breed standard. But each generation sure tries, 
                always to the detriment of the dogs.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"><br>
                The biggest problem at this time is unique to our breed and to 
                our time. &#8216;Fad breed&#8217; overpopulation is not unique, 
                but coupled with breed specific legislation (BSL) aimed at our 
                dogs, it is. America is drowning in bulldogs. Once considered 
                rare, they are now the single most popular breed in the U.S. Doubt 
                that? Consider that there are three registries for the pit bull/Am 
                Staff. And that is not even counting Staffie bulls, considered 
                by the public as &#8220;pit bulls&#8221;. Consider further that 
                most &#8220;pit bulls&#8221; are not registered. Consider that 
                just one registry registered more pit bulls in 2003 than the AKC 
                did Labradors. When you add in the other registry, the number 
                is greater than AKC Labs and golden retrievers combined. Take 
                a look at Petfinder.com, or at your local shelter. The highest 
                number of abandoned animals are pit bulls.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"><br>
                Because of this, the problem becomes:<em> ethical breeders are 
                not going to be producing dogs simply for public resale at this 
                time.</em> They understand and empathize with the sad fact of 
                the daily killing of hundreds of bulldogs in American shelters. 
                And yet they know that<em> responsible breeding must go on</em> 
                to keep the breeds from extinction; more so now than ever, since 
                &#8220;pretenders&#8221; have almost taken over the breed. If 
                all responsible breeders shut down, in ten years the pit bull 
                would be extinct, and in its place a hybrid animal no more like 
                the athletic, &#8220;medium&#8221; dog who earned the name, than 
                a dogue de Bourdeaux or French bulldog. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"><br>
                The answer to saving our breed is three pronged. First, everything 
                possible must be done to discourage and halt novice, back yard 
                breeders and &#8220;big name&#8221; puppymills from dumping thousands 
                of puppies a year into unsuitable homes. These animals and their 
                breeders are &quot;the problem&quot;, that threatens our breed. 
                &quot;Breeding bans&#8221; are of questionable help since they 
                cannot be enforced, and play into the hands of anti-pet activists. 
                But it is time for the dog fancy to police itself - before others 
                do it for us. </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"><br>
                Second, every serious breeder must study the AKC or UKC standard 
                (dependent on their breed) and understand it. If the standard 
                is not to their liking, then they must find a breed which fits 
                their ideal, and breed that. If you want a mastiff, there are 
                many fine mastiff breeds. If you want a misshapen dwarf of a dog, 
                sadly, there are already breeds that fit that bill. <em>The bulldog 
                is a medium, athletic breed - period.</em></font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"><br>
                Added to this, the serious breeder must understand that a win 
                at a dog show or schutzhund trial or any event is hardly the only 
                criteria to be used when deciding if a dog is good enough to be 
                bred. Hip and health checks are a non-negotiable part of today's 
                ethical breeder's program. They do not make excuses about bad 
                hips; they suck up and deal, and move on.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"><br>
                Ethical breeders understand that sound and &#8220;typey&#8221; 
                temperament is just as important as meeting the physical standard 
                of the breed. For this reason, they understand what bulldog temperament 
                is about, and they never breed a dog who fails to represent it. 
                They do not make excuses: &#8220;she is just a little shy&#8221;, 
                or &#8220;he doesn&#8217;t like men&#8221;, or &#8220;she was 
                abused&#8221;. <em>These dogs are too powerful to have unsound 
                temperaments. </em> </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"><br>
                Third, serious, ethical breeders should work together to produce 
                a system similar to the European style which has produced such 
                outstanding breeds as the Doberman, boxer, rottweiler and German 
                shepherd. A system which gives merit to those animals who are 
                outstanding. That encourages the breeding of our &#8220;medium&#8221; 
                built dog with its characteristic good temperament and heart. 
                </font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"><br>
                Serious breeders must sacrifice and work hard to come through 
                this most devastating of times in the history of the breed. This 
                is done by limiting breedings; serious buyers will find ethical 
                breeders, they always have, and they always will. To produce a 
                litter and have no waiting list of clients, to offer pups for 
                sale in the paper, or over the internet is unacceptable at this 
                time. To not cull poor specimens&#8212;as hard as it is - is to 
                give the breed another black eye.</font></p>
              <p align="justify"><font size="3"> The next ten years are probably 
                the most important in history, for our bulldogs. Will the tough-as-hell, 
                friendly-as-hell, medium, athletic pit bull become extinct through 
                breed bans and fad breeders? Or will they persevere, as they have 
                for so many hundreds of years? Each of us holds the answer on 
                the end of our leash, and in our heart.</font></p>
