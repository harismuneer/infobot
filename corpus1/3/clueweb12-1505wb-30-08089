          BATTLES IN SOUTHEASTERN LOUISIANA<br />
          APRIL 1862-JULY1863<br />
          BY<br />
          CHRISTOPHER G. <span class="style5">PE&Ntilde;A</span></h3>
        <p align="justify"><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br />
            <em>The War Between the States</em> did not touch Louisiana directly until April 1862, a  year after the start of hostilities between the North and South.&nbsp; Until that time, Louisiana&rsquo;s coastline  remained vulnerable to Union attack. Confederate authorities in Richmond,  Virginia, (the Confederate capital) did little to prevent the inevitable Union  invasion of Louisiana. Virtually all that protected southeast Louisiana from attack  were Forts St. Philip and Jackson located opposite each other along the  Mississippi, seventy-five miles south of New Orleans. When the Union navy  successfully bypassed the forts in late April 1862, New Orleans surrendered,  never to be reclaimed by the Confederacy.&nbsp;  Adding to the Union victory, Baton Rouge, the capital of Louisiana, was  soon occupied by Union forces.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
          Under  the leadership of Major General Benjamin Butler, Union forces began their  formal occupation of New Orleans on May 1, 1862. There was a strong but  unwarranted fear by Butler that Confederate forces would attempt to reclaim the  city.&nbsp; On August 5, 1862, there was an  attempt by Confederate forces to reclaim Baton Rouge. The battle fought at the  State capital turned out to be a Union victory.&nbsp;  Nevertheless, Butler continued to fear for the safety of his home base  at New Orleans.</p>
        <p align="justify">Soon  after the Battle of Baton Rouge, Union forces withdrew from the Capital and  began to concentrate in and around the New Orleans&rsquo; area.&nbsp; Confederate forces that had fought at Baton  Rouge withdrew northward and began to occupy the village of Port Hudson,  twenty-five miles upriver.&nbsp; The  Confederacy held that vital river port until July 1863, essentially blocking  all Union river-traffic coming from the south.&nbsp;  Vicksburg, 110 miles upriver from Port Hudson, was a second Confederate  bastion blocking Union river-traffic coming from the north.&nbsp; The defeat of both Port Hudson and Vicksburg  was a vital objective for the Union, if there was to be any attempt to control  the Mississippi, thus splitting the Confederacy in half.</p>
        <p align="justify">Because  Butler chose to concentrate his army in and around New Orleans, the land south  and west of the city in the region, referred to as the Lafourche district,  remained virtually unoccupied by Union forces.&nbsp;  Fortunately for Butler during the spring and early summer of 1862 there  was little in the way of a Confederate army in the Lafourche district to  threaten his western flank.&nbsp; Most of the  able-bodied men from that area who had volunteered for Confederate service had  been already transported to northern Mississippi, Tennessee, and east to  Virginia. However, there were small bands of partisan rangers (independent  military units), or &ldquo;guerillas,&rdquo; as they were labeled by the Union forces,  transferred from Texas and south central Louisiana that were operating in the  Lafourche region.&nbsp; They fought to push  all Yankee occupiers away from the Lafourche district&rsquo;s borders.&nbsp; During the summer and fall of 1862, several  skirmishes were fought near Raceland Station (now Raceland), at Boutte Station  (now Boutte), St. Charles Court House (now Hahnville), and St. Emma Plantation,  located along Bayou Lafourche three miles downriver from Donaldsonville (on La.  State Hwy. 1).</p>
        <p align="justify">In  July of 1862, along the west bank of the Mississippi south of Donaldsonville,  partisan rangers (recruited to the area by Governor Thomas O. Moore) began  shooting at Union shipping in the river.&nbsp;  The Union navy retaliated by shelling Donaldsonville on August 9, 1862.  Nearly the entire town was destroyed in the process. However, the destruction  of Donaldsonville did not deter Confederate forces concentrating in the  Lafourche district.&nbsp; Sporadic firing on  naval shipping continued, despite Union efforts to stop it.</p>
        <p align="justify">By  the third week of August 1862, Major General Richard &ldquo;Dick&rdquo; Taylor took command  of all Confederate forces in Louisiana west of the Mississippi River.&nbsp; He quickly began to organize an army from the  partisan rangers present in the area, along with additional men that he had  recruited from Texas and southern Mississippi. </p>
        <p align="justify">By  late summer and early fall, Butler began to realize his control of the New  Orleans area could never be solidified until he first annihilated Taylor&rsquo;s army  that was gathering strength in the Lafourche district.&nbsp; Only when he felt confident that his New  Orleans base of operation was safe from a Confederate attack from the eastern  side of the river did he begin to plan the invasion and conquest of the  Lafourche district.&nbsp; That decision was  not reached until late September 1862.</p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>

              <strong>October 27, 1862</strong> </span></p>
        <p align="justify">Butler&rsquo;s  plan for the invasion of the Lafourche district called for a three-prong  attack. His plan called for the Union navy (with army support) to steam up the  Atchafalaya River to Berwick Bay and Brashear City (now Morgan City) and block  the only Confederate escape route from the district.&nbsp; In the meantime, land forces would descend  the New Orleans, Opelousas, and Great Western Railroad (now Southern Pacific),  departing from Algiers, and drive all Confederate resistance away from the  eastern borders of the district.</p>
        <p align="justify">The  bulk of Butler&rsquo;s invasion force (led by newly appointed Brigadier General  Godfrey Weitzel) would ascend the Mississippi, land several miles south of  Donaldsonville (present area of the Sunshine Bridge &ndash; La. State Hwy. 70), and  drive all Confederate forces south along Bayou Lafourche.&nbsp; The converging Union land forces hoped to  unite near Thibodeaux (now Thibodaux) and complete the conquest by steadily  driving the Confederates toward Brashear City and their entrapment.</p>
        <p align="justify">On  Monday, October 27, 1862, after landing near Donaldsonville two days earlier,  Weitzel&rsquo;s forces ran into Confederate resistance two miles north of  Labadieville along Bayou Lafourche at a site called Georgia Landing (area  around the abandoned Supreme Sugar Refinery &ndash; La. State Hwy. 1).&nbsp; Led by Brigadier General Alfred Mouton, the  Confederates occupied both sides of the bayou. Weitzel wrongly assumed that  Mouton&rsquo;s army would confront him on the left descending bank of Bayou Lafourche  (La. State Hwy. 308).&nbsp; As a result, he  concentrated nearly all of his troops on that side of the bayou.</p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;Weitzel&rsquo;s only infantry regiment on the right  bank (La. State Hwy. 1) was the 8th New Hampshire. When it met stiff resistance,  Weitzel changed his attack strategy and crossed two additional regiments to the  right.&nbsp; Aiding in Weitzel&rsquo;s decision to  cross the bulk of his troops to the right was the unexplained withdrawal of  Confederate forces from his left.</p>
        <p align="center">Having  nearly three times the number of men at his disposal than Mouton could counter,  Weitzel easily overpowered his adversary.&nbsp;  The battle ended in a Union victory, with Mouton&rsquo;s forces eventually  retreating across Berwick Bay before the Union navy could close the trap.&nbsp; <br />
        </p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Union forces engaged ~ 2,000  infantry/artillery, 250 cavalry</strong><br />
            <strong>Union Casualties 8 killed, 74 wounded, 5  captured</strong><br />
            <strong>Confederate forces engaged ~ 1,400  infantry/artillery /cavalry</strong><br />
            <strong>Confederate Casualties 5 killed, 18  wounded, 186 captured</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">Union  forces soon quartered their troops in the Lafourche district after the Battle  of Georgia Landing.&nbsp; The first permanent  Union camp in the district was located on Acadia Plantation (present day  Nicholls State University)<strong>, </strong>one mile  south of Thibodeaux.&nbsp; Christened Camp  Stevens, it served as a base for Union forces in Lafourche until the following  spring.</p>
        <p align="justify">No  pursuit of Taylor&rsquo;s forces west of Brashear City was attempted in earnest until  spring of 1863.&nbsp; By then, Major General  Nathaniel P. Banks had replaced Butler. By the first week of April, Banks  amassed a force of 18,000 men from his 19th Army Corps at Brashear  City.&nbsp;&nbsp; Taylor&rsquo;s army, a dozen miles to  the west, had barely 4,000 men to counter the Union threat.</p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="left"><span class="style6"><strong>BATTLES OF BISLAND - April 12-13, 1863  and</strong><br />
              <strong>&nbsp;IRISH BEND or NERSON&rsquo;S WOODS - April 14, 1863</strong></span><br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong></strong><br />
          To  trap Taylor&rsquo;s army, Banks choose to divide his force.&nbsp; Brig. Gen. William H. Emory, the overall  commander of the first wing, took his 3rd Division with Weitzel&rsquo;s 2nd  Brigade of Maj. Gen. Christopher Augur&rsquo;s 1st Division (~ 10,000 men)  and crossed Berwick Bay at Brashear City.&nbsp;  Ten miles west of Berwick City (now Berwick), Emory confronted Taylor at  his campsite and fortified position near Thomas Bisland&rsquo;s Fairfax Plantation  (location of the Calumet Spillway and La. State Hwy 90 intersection).&nbsp; Defending Camp Bisland, Taylor positioned  3,000 men divided equally along both banks of Bayou Teche (Calumet Spillway  cuts through Bayou Teche).&nbsp; Brigadier  General Mouton defended the left descending bank, while Brigadier General Henry  H. Sibley from Texas defended the right.<br />
          For  two days, April 12-13, Union forces tried in vain to break the stubborn  Confederate resolve at Camp Bisland.&nbsp; A  Confederate retreat from Camp Bisland was ordered only after Taylor became  aware of Banks&rsquo; scheme to flank them by way of Grand Lake.</p>
        <p align="justify">While  Emory fought at Camp Bisland, Banks&rsquo; second wing boarded troop transports at  Brashear City and steamed west into Grand Lake (at the time the lake &ndash; starting  at Brashear City &ndash; roughly paralleled Bayou Teche).&nbsp; Under command of Brigadier General Cuvier  Grover (~ 8,000 men), his 4th Division was ordered by Banks to flank  Taylor&rsquo;s army by way of Grand Lake and get to the rear of the Confederates near  Franklin before Taylor realized his entrapment.</p>
        <p align="justify">When  Grover&rsquo;s troop transports were spotted in the lake by Confederate patrols,  Taylor ordered an evacuation of Camp Bisland during the night of April 13.  Confederate forces at Franklin quickly moved into Nerson&rsquo;s Woods at the base of  so-called &ldquo;Irish Bend,&rdquo; a horseshoe bend in Bayou Teche, to prevent Grover from  closing the Confederate escape route.</p>
        <p align="justify">Taylor,  at the Battle of Irish Bend or Nerson&rsquo;s Woods (April 14), succeeded in stopping  Grover&rsquo;s attempt to get to the rear of his army.&nbsp; As a result, Taylor was able to escape capture  and continue his orderly retreat northwest along Bayou Teche.&nbsp; Banks&rsquo; failed attempt at capturing Taylor&rsquo;s  army at Franklin resulted in an expanding offensive through the Teche region,  which in the long run accomplished nothing for the Union, other than driving  Taylor&rsquo;s army away from the Lafourche region&rsquo;s western borders. Though Taylor  eventually retreated beyond Alexandria, he was never annihilated as Banks  desired.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Casualties</strong><br />
            <strong>Bisland </strong><br />
            <strong>Union 40 killed, 184 wounded</strong><br />
            <strong>Confederate - unknown, but probably less</strong><br />
            <strong>Irish Bend or Nerson&rsquo;s Woods</strong><br />
            <strong>Union 49 killed, 274 wounded, 30 missing  or captured</strong><br />
            <strong>Confederate - unknown, but probably less</strong> </p>
        <p align="justify">With  Banks confident that Taylor&rsquo;s army had been pushed into extreme northwestern  Louisiana and no longer posed a threat to his western flank, his full attention  turned toward the defeat of the Confederate garrison at Port Hudson.&nbsp;&nbsp; Further north at Vicksburg, Major General U.  S. Grant had been given the task of defeating the Confederates at that locale.&nbsp; If the Union was to control the entire span  of the Mississippi, both Confederate ports would have to be captured.</p>
        <p align="justify">Stripping  nearly his entire manpower in the Lafourche district in order to concentrate  his forces at Port Hudson, Banks began his investment of the port village in May  1863.&nbsp; The result left the Lafourche  district short of Union troops and ripe for a Confederate counterattack.<br />
          By  the beginning of June 1863, Taylor&rsquo;s forces slowly began to reenter the Teche  region.&nbsp; Confederate forces under  Taylor&rsquo;s watch had attempted to relieve pressure on Vicksburg and Port Hudson  by threatening Union forces in northeast Louisiana along western banks of the  Mississippi.&nbsp; By the first week of June  this strategy had failed. There was hope by the Confederate high command that  Banks would relinquish his investment of Port Hudson and redirect his army  towards the Crescent City, if he felt his home base and his western flank in  the Lafourche district were threatened.</p>
        <p align="justify">Taylor&rsquo;s  first task in reclaiming the district was the capture of Brashear City.&nbsp; To accomplish this, Taylor divided his  army.&nbsp; One cavalry brigade, led by  Colonel James P. Major, crossed the upper Atchafalaya River, headed east to the  west bank of the Mississippi, and entered the district by way of Bayou  Lafourche.&nbsp; Once at Thibodeaux, Major was  ordered to travel west to Brashear City and cut off the Union escape route to  New Orleans.</p>
        <p align="justify">Major&rsquo;s  176-mile flanking maneuver was brilliantly performed.&nbsp; On June 20, 1863, Major&rsquo;s advance guard  easily overran the Union garrison at Thibodeaux, capturing badly needed  supplies and arms.&nbsp; However, Major&rsquo;s  descent into the district would not go totally unchallenged.&nbsp; Lieutenant Colonel Albert Stickney, Union  commander of the Lafourche district, was aware of Major&rsquo;s presence and  fortified a position on the eastern banks of Bayou Lafourche at Lafourche  Crossing (La. State Hwy. 308).&nbsp; Unaware  that Taylor soon threatened Brashear City from the west with the remaining  portion of his army, Stickney withdrew several hundred troops from that locale  and raced by rail toward Lafourche Crossing during the predawn hours of June  20.&nbsp; Stickney was mistakenly informed  that Lafourche Crossing was Major&rsquo;s next target.</p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><span class="style6"><strong>BATTLE OF LAFOURCHE CROSSING</strong><br />
              <strong>June 20-21, 1863</strong></span></p>
        <p align="justify">In  the late afternoon of June 20, a Confederate force nearing Lafourche Crossing  was fired upon by Stickney&rsquo;s artillery. The Battle of Lafourche Crossing had  begun.&nbsp; The Confederates quickly returned  to their base at Thibodeaux to report the Yankee presence and strength at the  Crossing.</p>
        <p align="justify">In  the early morning hours of June 21, Major entered Thibodeaux with the rest of  his brigade. Aware that his order from General Taylor was to cut off the  Union&rsquo;s eastern escape route from Brashear City, Major ordered Colonel Charles  Pyron and his 2nd Texas Mounted Cavalry to feint an attack at the Crossing to  keep Stickney occupied.&nbsp; Meanwhile, by  the evening of June 20, Stickney received reinforcements from New Orleans.&nbsp; His collective force by June 21 numbered ~  850 men.&nbsp; Pyron&rsquo;s cavalry regiment was  numbered at ~ 206 men.</p>
        <p align="justify">A  fierce thunderstorm at midday, June 21, delayed the second day&rsquo;s fighting until  late afternoon or early evening.&nbsp; Pyron,  probably flushed with past victories or wrongly assuming his adversary was easy  prey, attacked the Union position in full force, rather than feint an attack as  Major had ordered.&nbsp; The result was  disastrous for Pyron&rsquo;s regiment.&nbsp;  Stickney held his ground even in the face of hand-to-hand combat with  the Texas troopers.&nbsp; As night fell,  Pyron&rsquo;s battered force retreated back to Thibodeaux.</p>
        <h4 align="justify">&nbsp;</h4>
        <h4 align="center">Casualties<br />
            <strong>Union - 8 killed, 41 wounded</strong><br />
            <strong>Confederate - 53 killed, 60 wounded  (Union reports)</strong></h4>
        <p align="justify">Major,  wanting to get to the rear of Brashear City as quickly as possible, ordered an  evacuation of Thibodeaux during the late evening of June 22.&nbsp; His brigade reached Chacahoula Station (now  Chacahoula) by dawn, June 23. Union forces reoccupied Thibodeaux that same  morning.&nbsp; The Union occupation of  Thibodeaux lasted until the following day.</p>
        <p align="justify">Initially  wanting to get to the rear of Major&rsquo;s brigade, a small Union force at Lafourche  Crossing was sent towards Chacahoula with instructions to repair rail bridges  burned by Major&rsquo;s force as the Confederate forces moved west toward Brashear  City.&nbsp; On June 24, a sharp skirmish occurred  near Chacahoula Station as Union workmen and soldiers brushed against some of  Major&rsquo;s rearguard.</p>
        <p align="justify">Union  forces advanced no further than Chacahoula.&nbsp;  On that same day, June 24, the Union authorities at Thibodeaux were  wrongly informed that a Confederate army consisting of 7,000 men was advancing  down Bayou Lafourche toward their position.&nbsp;  Though the information was totally erroneous, the effect was to cause a  general evacuation of all Union troops from the Thibodeaux area.&nbsp; They withdrew back to New Orleans leaving  Major&rsquo;s brigade unmolested and free to complete its task.</p>
        <p align="justify">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><span class="style6"><strong>BATTLE OF BRASHEAR CITY </strong><br />
              <strong>June 23, 1863</strong></span></p>
        <p align="justify">As  Major&rsquo;s brigade rode into Chacahoula the morning of June 23, distant artillery  shells exploding were heard coming from Brashear City.&nbsp; The Battle of Brashear City had begun.</p>
        <p align="justify">Taylor,  with the bulk of his army along the western shores of Berwick Bay (that portion  of the Atchafalaya River at Brashear and Berwick City was called Berwick Bay),  knew he could not attack Brashear City from the west.&nbsp; The bay was at least a quarter-mile wide and  he lacked sufficient transports to cross.&nbsp;  In addition, the Union garrison at Brashear City had one gunboat, the  U.S.S. <em>Hollyhock</em>, patrolling the bay.</p>
        <p align="justify">If  Taylor was to succeed in capturing Brashear City, he needed a bold attack  strategy.&nbsp; He settled for a risky but  necessary surprise flank attack.&nbsp; With  his artillery ready to shell the town from the western shores of the bay, a  small continent of volunteers paddled through Grand Lake landing their rowboats  northeast of the village and to the rear of the Union garrison (present day  Lake End Park).</p>
        <p align="justify">In  the early morning hours of June 23, in order to distract the enemy&rsquo;s attention  away from the landing party, Taylor ordered his artillery to shell Brashear  City. During the chaos, Confederate forces (numbering under 300 and led by  Major Sherod Hunter) surprised the Union garrison overwhelming Fort Buchanan  (located north of the village) and Fort Brashear or Star&nbsp; (located near the south end).&nbsp; The battle was a complete Confederate  victory.&nbsp; (During the battle the <em>Hollyhock </em>withdrew, streaming south  toward the gulf.)&nbsp; A Union garrison seven  miles to the east of Brashear City at Bayou Boeuf (present-day Amelia) surrendered  the next day when they realized that their escape route to New Orleans was  closed.&nbsp; By then, Major&rsquo;s brigade was  pressing them from the east, while the rest of Taylor&rsquo;s army was advancing from  the direction of Brashear City.</p>
        <p align="center"><strong>Casualties at Brashear City</strong><br />
            <strong>Union - 46 killed, 40 wounded, 1,300  prisoners</strong><br />
            <strong>at Bayou Boeuf - additional 275  prisoners taken</strong><br />
            <strong>Confederate - 3 killed, 18 wounded</strong></p>
        <p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="justify"><span class="style6"><strong>BATTLE OF FORT BUTLER </strong><br />
              <strong>June 28, 1863</strong></span></p>
        <p align="justify">With  Brashear City secure and all Union forces at Lafourche Crossing in retreat  toward New Orleans, all that stood in the way of total Confederate control of  the Lafourche district was the Union fortification at Donaldsonville called  Fort Butler. (The structure, a star-shaped earthen fortification located at the  confluence of Bayou Lafourche and the Mississippi River, was built between  November 1862 and February 1863.) Major had chosen to bypass Fort Butler on his  earlier descent of Bayou Lafourche. Brigadier General Tom Green with  approximately 1,200 men in his command was given orders to take possession of  the Union fort.</p>
        <p align="justify">Arriving  nine miles short of Fort Butler by the morning of June 27 (juncture of La.  State Hwy 1 and 70), Green sent word to the Union commander, Major Joseph D.  Bullen, to surrender his garrison of approximately 180 men, but Bullen  refused.&nbsp; Both sides spent the remaining  portion of the day preparing for battle.&nbsp;  Because of the topography and other concerns, Green chose to attack Fort  Butler in the early morning hours of June 28, under the cover of darkness. Due  in large part to faulty Confederate reconnaissance and Union naval support that  sped to the scene once the battle got underway, the Confederate attack failed. </p>
        <p align="center"><br />
            <strong>Casualties</strong><br />
            <strong>Union army - 8 killed, 13 wounded (Navy  - 1 killed, 2 wounded)</strong><br />
            <strong>Confederate - 40 killed, 114 wounded,  107 missing or captured</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">Having  failed to capture Fort Butler, Green ordered a portion of his force to the west  bank of the Mississippi below Donaldsonville.&nbsp;  For nearly two weeks, a near constant bombardment between Confederate  batteries and the Union navy was heard below Donaldsonville.&nbsp; The effect was to disrupt Union-shipping  coming to and from New Orleans.</p>
        <p align="justify">The  Confederate attacks on shipping ended July 10 when Green ordered the batteries  back to Bayou Lafourche.&nbsp; By that time,  Vicksburg had surrendered (July 4) and Port Hudson soon after (July 9).&nbsp; Union forces at Port Hudson soon began to  concentrate their numbers at Donaldsonville.&nbsp;  The Union plan called for a final push to trap and crush Dick Taylor&rsquo;s  army.</p>
        <p align="justify"><br />
            <span class="style6"><strong>BATTLE OF KOCK'S OR COX'S PLANTATION </strong><br />
            <strong>July 13, 1863</strong></span></p>
        <p align="justify">Advancing  down both sides of Bayou Lafourche on July 12, two Union brigades,  approximately 3,000 men, briefly skirmished with a portion of Tom Green&rsquo;s  forces of 1,550 men.&nbsp; Green&rsquo;s men were  divided equally on both sides of the bayou.&nbsp;  The skirmish of July 12 was only a prelude to a larger battle that was  fought the next day.</p>
        <p align="justify">Approximately  four miles south of Donaldsonville, Union and Confederate forces confronted one  another in the early morning hours of July 13.&nbsp;  Green, in direct command of Confederate forces on the right descending  bank of the bayou (La. State Hwy. 1), succeeded in flanking his adversary, a  Union brigade lead by Colonel Nathan A. M. Dudley.&nbsp; On the opposite bank, Union commander Acting  Brigadier General Joseph S. Morgan withdrew his forces without orders.&nbsp; Colonel Walter Lane (in command of  Confederate forces on the left bank of the bayou &ndash; La State Hwy. 308) was then  able to fire upon Dudley&rsquo;s left flank.&nbsp;  Union reinforcements on the right (sent for and under the command of  Colonel Charles J. Paine) could do little to blunt the Confederate advance, in  light of Morgan&rsquo;s unwarranted retreat.&nbsp;  The battle ended with Union forces driven off the battlefield and  fleeing toward the safety of Fort Butler and the Union navy off the waters at  Donaldsonville.</p>
        <p align="center"><br />
            <strong>Casualties</strong><br />
            <strong>Union - 56 killed, 223 wounded, 186  missing or captured</strong><br />
            <strong>Confederate - 3 killed, 30 wounded, 6  mortally </strong></p>
        <p align="justify">On  July 14, Taylor, aware then of the surrender of Vicksburg and Port Hudson,  ordered the evacuation of the Lafourche district, despite Green&rsquo;s success at  the Battle of Kock&rsquo;s Plantation.&nbsp; By the  3rd week of July 1863, the district was again under Union control.</p>
        <p align="justify">The  Battle of Kock&rsquo;s Plantation marked the last hurrah between organized units from  the North and South.&nbsp; Numerous skirmishes  and affairs between Confederate guerrillas and Union occupying forces continued  in the district until war&rsquo;s end, but the clash of full scale battles ended in  July of 1863.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Revised, September 5, 2007<br />
