      <h1>Particular types of copyright material </h1>
      <h2><i>A. Music: Recordings of performances</i></h2>
      <p>There are different levels of copyright in music. There is 
        copyright in the musical notation, the lyrics, the published edition of the 
        sheet music (that is the layout and look of the music) the sound recording. 
        Performers have separate protection. </p>
      <p>If the underlying music is still in copyright, permission will 
        usually be required to perform the work in public and record the work. These permissions can 
        be obtained through APRA/AMCOS if the composer and music publisher are 
        members of that collecting society. If not, individual permissions will need 
        to be obtained from the composer or the music publisher.</p>
      <h3>1. Rights in the underlying music performed - lyrics, written music 
        and published edition copyright</h3>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>Unless the staff member is performing a work that they have 
          composed themselves, there will be some underlying copyright in the material 
          they are performing and/or recording.</p>
        <h4 class="black">SONG LYRICS – translations also protected</h4>
        <p>There will be copyright in the words or lyrics to any song 
          performed. These are protected as a literary work, separate to the copyright 
          in the musical notation or the sound recording itself. This protection will 
          last for the life of the lyric writer plus 70 years, unless the creator of 
          the work died before 1 January 1955 in which case the material is no longer 
          protected by copyright.</p>
        <p>A translation of the lyrics would also create a new and 
          separate copyright to that in the original words. This in turn would attract 
          copyright protection for the period of life of the translator plus 70 years 
          unless the translator died before 1 January 1955.</p>
        <h4 class="black">MUSICAL NOTATION – arrangements also protected</h4>
        <p>There will be copyright in the musical notation itself, 
          lasting for the life of the composer plus 70 years, unless the creator of 
          the work died before 1 January 1955 in which case the copyright has expired.</p>
        <p>Each new arrangement will attract copyright protection for 
          the person who made the arrangement, even where the original work is out of 
          copyright. This protection will last for the life of the arranger plus 70 
          years. If the arranger died before 1 January 1955 the protection for that 
          aspect of the work has ended.</p>
        <h4 class="black">PUBLISHED EDITION COPYRIGHT</h4>
        <p>Sheet music is protected by a separate copyright for the 
          publisher’s physical layout of the information on the page. </p>
        <p>If the academic is reproducing a facsimile of sheet music 
          in their research, using a copy of a work that was published in hard copy 
          less than 25 years ago, they will need permission from the publisher, to use 
          that particular edition.</p>
        <h4 class="black">MULTIPLE AUTHORSHIP</h4>
        <p>Any song lyrics or words to a musical work, or the musical 
          notation in the work, or translation or arrangement of that work could have 
          been created by more than one composer or lyricist. Copyright protection 
          then lasts for the lifetime of the last surviving author plus 70 years, 
          unless the last surviving author died before 1 January 1955. Permission 
          from all creators of the work would have to be obtained to reproduce the 
          work.</p>
        <h4 class="black">FOLK OR TRADITIONAL MUSIC</h4>
        <p>Traditional or folk music may not be protected by copyright 
          as it has been performed for a period longer than that of copyright 
          protection. However laws on this may differ for different countries and 
          legal advice should be sought in particular cases.
              </div>
      <h3>2. Rights in the sound recording.</h3>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>There will be different copyright issues with a sound 
          recording, depending on who made the recording and when and where it was 
          made.</p>
        <h4 class="black">WHO OWNS THE RECORDING?</h4>
        <p>The owner of a sound recording is the maker of the 
          recording, such as a recording company. From 1 January 2005 performers also 
          have part ownership in the sound recording of their live performances. These 
          rights can be assigned by contract. Most recording companies will ask 
          performers to assign these rights. </p>
        <p>Monash University claims copyright ownership for all sound 
          recordings where the university has made a specific contribution of funding, 
          resources, facilities or apparatus in its creation. It is possible the 
          academic would have a licence from the university to use the performance for 
          research purposes. If the recording is to be made available to the public or 
          used for another purpose and the academic used Monash equipment or funding 
          for the recording, the solicitors’ office should be consulted.</p>
        <p><b>Note: </b> If the recording of a performance took place 
          outside Australia, the copyright law of the country where the recording was 
          made would apply. This would require specialist advice. </p>
        <h4 class="black">MAKING A SOUND RECORDING AVAILABLE ONLINE - MADE BY RECORD COMPANY</h4>
        <p>If part of a sound recording made by a record company, is 
          to be included on a website accessible to the public, permission will need to be sought from 
          that company or a relevant industry body to communicate the recording 
          online. ARIA are the industry body for recording companies and can be 
          consulted about permission to re-record or copy sound recordings. PPCA are 
          the collecting society for performance and online communication of sound 
          recordings. </p>
        <p>If the recording of the performance was outside Australia 
          and the record company only remastered or reworked the recording, they would 
          not be considered the makers of the recording. This is subject to any terms 
          of a contract made with the recording company. </p>
        <h4 class="black">MAKING A SOUND RECORDING AVAILABLE ONLINE - MADE BY ACADEMIC STAFF</h4>
        <p>If an academic has recorded a performance in Australia, 
          they would need to have obtained all the permissions for recording the 
          underlying music and lyrics and obtained permission from the performers. 
          Permission from performers is required for making the recording and for the 
          manner in which the recording is being used. If the recording was of a 
          performance made after 1 January 2005 the performers would be part owners of 
          the recording. If these permissions were not obtained, then the recording 
          could infringe copyright. Permissions should be obtained before the file is 
          made available on a website accessible to the public.</p>
        <p><b>Note: </b>Normally the venue or concert organisers would 
          arrange copyright licences for performance of the music and lyrics of the 
          work, but if those were not obtained then the recording could be infringing 
          because the original performance was unauthorised. Permissions should be 
          obtained before the material is included on a website accessible to the public.</p>
        
      </div>
      <h3>3. Performer&#39;s rights</h3>
      <div class="indent">
        <p>Permission from performers is necessary when a recording is 
          made of their performance. If consent is not obtained, the performer could 
          object to any use of the sound recording, such as having it broadcast. It 
          would be advisable to get this consent in writing.</p>
        <p>Performers’ rights also include the conductor, even though 
          they are not heard on a recording. </p>
        <p>If the academic is performing and being recorded with any 
          other performers, the permission of the other performers is needed for the 
          sound recording to be made and for any future use of the recording, such as 
          inclusion on a website accessible to the public. </p>
        <p>Performers are considered the makers of their sound 
          recordings along with the owners of the master recording. A separate licence would 
          be needed from the performer, as the part owner of the sound recording, to 
          include the sound recording on a website accessible to the public. This would be in addition to 
          the performers rights over their performance.</p>
        <h4 class="black">MORAL RIGHTS FOR PERFORMERS</h4>
        <p>Performers in sound recordings also have moral rights 
          protection. This means 
          that all performers on a recording will need to be listed. Performers will 
          also have the right to object to any derogatory treatment of their 
          performance.</p>
      </div>
      <h2><i>B. Dramatic works: Recordings of performances</i></h2>
      <p>There are different levels of copyright in a recording of a 
        dramatic work. There is copyright in the script, the stage directions and 
        choreography if written down, any music and lyrics and in any sound 
        recordings or films used in the performance. </p>
      <p>If the dramatic work, which is 
        the script, is still in copyright, permission will be required to perform 
        the work in public and record the work. These permissions would be obtained through a 
        publisher or literary agent.</p>
      <p>The copyright owner of the dramatic work may give permission 
        for performance of the work on the condition that no recording of the 
        performance is made. There is no relevant exception in the Copyright Act 
        that would allow such a recording to be made for inclusion on a public access website.</p>
      <h3 class="black">Performers’ rights</h3>
      <p>If permission for the recording was 
        obtained, you would need permission from all performers to make such a 
        recording and to make the recording available on a website accessible to the public. </p>
      <p>However performers do not have ownership rights in 
        audio-visual recordings of their live performances, only in sound 
        recordings. So the copyright owner of the audio-visual recording of the 
        dramatic work would be the maker of the recording. Performers do not have 
        moral rights in audio-visual material, only sound recordings.</p>
      <h2><i>C. Artistic works including installations and photos</i></h2>
      <p>An artistic work includes paintings, sculptures, drawings, 
        photos, buildings or models of buildings and works of artistic craftsmanship 
        – such as tapestries or mosaics. They do not have to be of artistic merit to 
        be protected by copyright. Each image is a separate copyright work in 
        itself.</p>
      <h3 class="black">Photos</h3>
      <p>Photos are protected by copyright and the copyright owner 
        is generally the photographer, unless the image was taken by an employee. 
        Then copyright is generally owned by the employer. Photos commissioned for a 
        particular purpose can be used for that purpose. However copyright remains 
        with the photographer, not the commissioning agent, unless there is a 
        provision in the contract to the contrary.</p>
      <p>If an academic takes a photo of an artwork, unless the 
        artwork is out of copyright, they would need permission from the copyright 
        owner of the artwork to reproduce the photo online on a website accessible to the public.</p>
      <p>There are exceptions in the Copyright Act where photos are 
        taken of buildings, models of buildings, sculptures and works of artistic 
        craftsmanship permanently located in a public place. No copyright permission 
        is required to take photos of these artworks.</p>
      <h3 class="black">Using artistic works in research material</h3>
      <p>Artistic works may include references or extracts from 
        other works. For example a collage might use parts of photographs or a video 
        installation might include extracts from films or TV. The use and 
        communication online of this third party copyright 
        material might require permission from the copyright owners of that 
        material. Even an artistic work in the same style as another could be an 
        infringement if there were substantial similarities between the works. 
        Recently the modification of the Google logo in slight ways to be reflective 
        of the art of Joan Miro was the subject of a cease and desist letter by the 
        artists estate. </p>
      <p>It would depend on the amount used from another work, 
        whether it was insignificant or unrecognisable. This may need to be looked 
        at on a case by case basis.</p>
      <p>If an artist died before 1 January 1955, their work should 
        be in the public domain. This is why parodies or pastiches of the Mona Lisa 
        are not infringements because copyright protection for the original painting 
        has expired. </p>
      <h3 class="black">Moral rights for artistic works</h3>
      <p>When reproducing a substantial amount of another work, the 
        original artist needs to be credited in some way. Any major changes to their 
        work could be an infringement of the moral right of integrity in the work.</p>
      <h2><i>D. Broadcasts</i></h2>
      <p>If academics want to place recordings taken from broadcasts of 
        radio, television or cable on a website accessible to the public, they would need permission of 
        the broadcaster to make a recording of the broadcast for inclusion  
        on a website accessible to the public. Examples would be a recording on the ABC of an interview with 
        them about their research speciality or a performance of their musical 
        composition performed on SBS.</p>
      <p>If research material contains any third party material that is 
        a broadcast, for example images from a television show changed and mixed in 
        a multimedia work, the academic would need permission from the broadcaster 
        to use the images in this way, as well as the underlying literary, dramatic 
        and musical works in the broadcast.</p>
      <h2><i>E. Film</i></h2>
      <p>Film includes TV programs, cinema and animation and their 
        accompanying sounds. A computer game was considered a film in one Australian 
        case.</p>
      <p>There are separate levels of copyright in films. There is the 
        script or screenplay, the visual images, the soundtrack and the underlying 
        musical work.</p>
      <p>If an artistic work is included in a piece of film that is 
        displayed on a website accessible to the public, but the artistic work is not the subject of the film and is only 
        included as part of the background, there is an exception for ‘incidental’ 
        copying of artistic works in a film.</p>
      <p >Sculptures, buildings, models of buildings and works of 
        artistic craftsmanship which are permanently located in public places may 
        also be filmed without seeking permission from the copyright owners. </p>
      <p>If material includes footage taken from a film that was created 
        by a third party, permission would be required to include that material. The 
        copyright owner of the film is usually the producer or studio that made the 
        film. However there may be a different copyright owner for the script or for 
        the music played in the soundtrack. Permission would need to be obtained 
        from all copyright owners to place the film on a website accessible to the public.</p>

      <p>Multimedia works may contain several types of copyright works. 
        If a multimedia work includes substantial or significant parts of copyright 
        material created by others, such as famous cartoon characters or music that 
        was not composed by the creator of the multimedia work, permission would be 
        required from the owners of that third party material before it could be 
        placed on a website accessible to the public.</p>
