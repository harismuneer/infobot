				<p>President Obama yesterday insisted that Congress enact a $1.5 Trillion tax increase on the well-to-do. Although he wasn&#8217;t specific about what he meant, he can only be referring to raising the Capital Gains Tax rate.</p>
<p>In 2009, the UK was considering raising their Capital Gains Tax rate from 18% to 28%, which they did in 2010 for all but the bottom income earners. During the debate on raising the tax, a study was conducted by the Adam Smith Institute analyzing the numbers in the US.</p>
<p>Capital gains tax rates in the USA have changed considerably up and down in recent years and decades and provide a rich seam of data with which one can come to solid conclusions on the revenue effects of such changes. One can be sure that President Obama has not seen, nor does he likely care to see, what history has shown.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theabsurdreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Capital-Gains-Rates.jpg"><img src="http://www.theabsurdreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Capital-Gains-Rates.jpg" alt="" title="Capital Gains Rates" width="603" height="438" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-41484" /></a></p>
<p><strong>The pattern shows that every time the capital gains tax has been cut, capital gains tax revenues have risen. Every time the capital gains tax has been raised, capital gains tax revenues have fallen. The following are some clear examples:</strong><br />
[...]<br />
All of the data were summarized in an important piece of research by Professor Paul D. Evans of Ohio State University, who looked at how taxpayers might respond to an increase in the capital gains rate, using taxpayer data from the most recent available years at the time of his study.</p>
<p>In his study, The Relationship Between Realized Capital Gains and Their Marginal Rate of Taxation, 1976-2004, Evans found that at current US tax rates, a 1 percentage point reduction in the marginal tax rates on capital gains might trigger a 10.32 percent increase in realized capital gains. Behavior in recent years is broadly similar to that found in earlier studies, so this likely holds true for 2011.</p>
<p>He found that raising the US capital gains tax rate from the current 15% <strong>would reduce federal capital gains tax revenue</strong> and that additional revenue would be lost from other parts of the income tax and from other federal taxes due to reduced investment, employment, and income. <strong>He found that the optimal capital gains tax rate to maximize public welfare, and to help the federal budget, is closer to if not zero.</strong></p>
<p>Furthermore, the gains in tax receipts following the reduction of the CGT rate to 15% in 2003 were not expected by the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation, which officially score tax changes. The graph below compares actual capital gains revenues with the forecasts made when the tax cut was proposed:</p>

<p><strong>SideBear:</strong> What is misleading about this &#8220;Buffet Rule&#8221; debate (class envy) is the dollars that are used to invest in stocks etc. has already been taxed already at 35% (pick a rate) and the Capital Gain taxes is a second tax on the same money and when you add ins State and Local taxes, the money is being taxed at a rate well above 50%. </p>
<p>This is the part of the story that Warren Buffet left out.</p>

			<p>Your conclusions are absurd. If the government tells me that long-term capital gains taxes are going to rise next year, I&#8217;m going to take my profit while the tax rate is lower. I&#8217;m sure everyone else is going to as well. This is going to mean a big rise in revenues from capital gains. And you completely mis-understand the &#8216;Buffet Rule&#8217;. I&#8217;m not going to be taxed a second time on the money I&#8217;ve already been taxed on, I&#8217;m only getting taxed on my profit. Which is a lot less than the tax rate on my day job, which costs me more than double the tax rate. Not only that, but I really don&#8217;t have to work much to make that profit; my capital is working for me! Kinda like owning slaves!</p>

			<p>&#8220;Your conclusions are absurd.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree, your conclusions are absurd.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the government tells me that long-term capital gains taxes are going to rise next year, I’m going to take my profit while the tax rate is lower. I’m sure everyone else is going to as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>No, they are not.  First of all, this implies you know absolutely nothing about investing, since people don&#8217;t move money in and out of investments on a whim, much less on a minor thing like a little more or less tax.  Most of those investments are time sensitive, or real estate, neither of which sells on the next bid like stocks.  And even stock sales have to be carefully considered when you have that much money.  Secondly, the calculations have to be made, and not everyone will do the same thing.  Each will be in a different situation, each will be affected differently, and each will have a different &#8216;best move&#8217; to make.  Third, this simple assumption completely ignores that you&#8217;re just moving SOME revenue from next year&#8217;s higher rate (money you didn&#8217;t get, sort of like selling it this year for ten bucks instead of waiting and selling it next year for twelve) into this year, and next year will come up short.  It will wash in the end.</p>
<p>&#8220;And you completely mis-understand the ‘Buffet Rule’. I’m not going to be taxed a second time on the money I’ve already been taxed on, I’m only getting taxed on my profit.&#8221;</p>
<p>You have already paid a tax on that corporate profit.  Your tax is the second one applied.  It is YOU who misunderstand something so vague as the Buffet Rule (since it can be tweaked and changed without actually admitting that it was, not including the different ways to interpret what&#8217;s there already, it&#8217;s hardly measurable or comparable to actual tax rates).  Not only that, you liberal/socialists always leave out the part where taxes go up, tax revenue goes down.  It&#8217;s not a zero sum game.  The money just doesn&#8217;t get invested, or gets invested somewhere else.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which is a lot less than the tax rate on my day job&#8221;</p>
<p>Um, I&#8217;m going to have to go with liar here, unless you make a boatload of money.  Capital gains rates are twenty to twenty eight percent.  In the top tax brackets, you&#8217;re only paying thirty five, that&#8217;s just not a lot more than the tax rate.  Chances are, with deductions and all, you&#8217;re actually only paying about fifteen to twenty, which is less than the capital gains tax rates being bandied about by anyone, much less Buffet.</p>
<p>&#8220;which costs me more than double the tax rate.&#8221;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re not very clear here.  What exactly costs you twice the tax rate?  And which tax rate, the capital gains, or your current income tax bracket?  And, you&#8217;re not clear on which bracket you&#8217;re in, you should state this just to reduce confusion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not only that, but I really don’t have to work much to make that profit; my capital is working for me! Kinda like owning slaves!&#8221;</p>
<p>This is called capitalism.  They taught it in my school.  Where did you go?  Your money could have been invested in real estate, which gets more valuable, and then you sell it.  Where did you own slaves?  What law did you break?  Which human did you demean or dehumanize in the ownership of your land?  How can you equate making profit with owning slaves?  I think you are simply repeating Marxist crap, and I doubt that you even have a job, much less one who would pay taxes.</p>

			<p>The comment about slaves is that you took your cash, bought some, and now they earn you money. Just like the stock market. I would not have a wash selling a stock this year in a low long term-capital gains tax structure vs. next year in a higher capital gains tax. To be clear, if I get taxed $15 on the sale of my $100 stock this year, and $20 if I sell next year, I have a big incentive to take my profit this year. It&#8217;s that simple.  </p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve already paid a tax on that corporate profit&#8221;. No, the corporation I invested in paid a tax. If I earn $20,000, I pay taxes on that, and if I then hire someone and pay them $20,000, they pay a tax on that. They didn&#8217;t pay my taxes, and I didn&#8217;t pay theirs. The money goes around, and it gets earned (and taxed) multiple times year year.</p>
<p>I was unclear about the different tax rates; when I make a long-term capital gains sale, I pay 15% tax. If I earn that same money as wages, I pay maybe 35%. I might indeed get a deduction that reduces my taxes, but that would be the same if it were capital gains or wages. But I&#8217;ve got alot more deductions available for my capital gains profits, as I can deduct expenses and losses, which I really can&#8217;t with wages. </p>
<p>&#8221; I think you are simply repeating Marxist crap, and I doubt that you even have a job, much less one who would pay taxes.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;re spouting some warmed over slogans worthy of Senator McCarthy. If you actually have a job, it&#8217;s because someone owes you father a favor, not because you can think your way through any problem with logic. You can&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Okay, you&#8217;re a Marxist, we get it.  You think owning a business is like slavery.  But what&#8217;s your option?  For the state to own the business and be the slave owner?  Tell me, do you make a profit at your job?  I think you do, so that makes you a slave owner as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would not have a wash selling a stock this year in a low long term-capital gains tax structure vs. next year in a higher capital gains tax. To be clear, if I get taxed $15 on the sale of my $100 stock this year, and $20 if I sell next year, I have a big incentive to take my profit this year. It’s that simple.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, you have little incentive to sell this year.  You&#8217;re only talking about a five percent difference.  Stock strade up and down that much in a week.  You would hold or sell the stock depending upon your investment decisions.  But of course, you don&#8217;t know anything about this, because you&#8217;re a Marxist.  You really should learn about something before you condemn it, instead of just repeating your professor&#8217;s pap.</p>
<p>“You’ve already paid a tax on that corporate profit”. No, the corporation I invested in paid a tax.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow, you agree with me and still think you&#8217;re disagreeing with me.  A hundred dollars profit was taxed at whatever rate, then taxed again when it was distributed to you.  If you&#8217;re too stupid to understand this, please, just stop talking.</p>
<p>&#8220;If I earn $20,000, I pay taxes on that, and if I then hire someone and pay them $20,000, they pay a tax on that. They didn’t pay my taxes, and I didn’t pay theirs. The money goes around, and it gets earned (and taxed) multiple times year year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Keynsian bullshit.  If you earn twenty thousand, you pay taxes.  You then hire someone, how are you going to pay them twenty grand?  You have twenty grand minus the taxes.  Then you pay him whatever you have left, he pays taxes, eventually, the pool shrinks.  Got it?  That money is money that WOULD have been spent in the local economy, by you, by spending the whole twenty grand to hire someone, who could then do it again, and again, and again.  Instead, the money goes to taxes, which is more wasteful than any spending category, especially because of the corruption and waste.  You spending a dollar or saving a dollar gets a dollar&#8217;s worth of spending or saving, the government gets that dollar minus corruption and waste, which always goes to rich people, or at least, they&#8217;re rich once they get their graft.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was unclear about the different tax rates; when I make a long-term capital gains sale, I pay 15% tax. If I earn that same money as wages, I pay maybe 35%. I might indeed get a deduction that reduces my taxes, but that would be the same if it were capital gains or wages. But I’ve got alot more deductions available for my capital gains profits, as I can deduct expenses and losses, which I really can’t with wages.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wow, where to begin.  Yes, you can deduct expenses and losses with wages, I&#8217;ve done it every year I worked, unless they were too small to worry about.  Capital gains is treated differently than income, and even with the different tax rates, you&#8217;re still talking about a very small difference, a few percentage points of the price of the stock, an insignificant amount in overall consideration of whether to buy and sell.  Again, you demonstrate an amazing ignorance of all things capitalism, including how the stock market and the tax system works.</p>
<p>” I think you are simply repeating Marxist crap, and I doubt that you even have a job, much less one who would pay taxes.”</p>
<p>I think you’re spouting some warmed over slogans worthy of Senator McCarthy.&#8221;</p>
<p>I am stating facts.  Just because they have to be repeated ad infinitum to respond to your lies doesn&#8217;t make them untrue or &#8220;warmed over&#8221; anything.  And Senator McCarthy was right about ninety five percent of the people he accused, so be careful who you associate me with, the slander job on McCarthy is coming unravelled as time goes on.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you actually have a job, it’s because someone owes you father a favor, not because you can think your way through any problem with logic. You can’t.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is called a Non-Sequitur.  If I have a job, it&#8217;s because I have a skill, not because I can &#8220;think my way through any problem&#8221;.  Of course, that skill should be handy in any job, but it&#8217;s not required in many of them, especially low-skilled labor jobs.  The second half is that you have not demonstrated any reason why I don&#8217;t have logic, or why my father being owed a favor got me my job.  All of which you make up from whole cloth.  Together, these are called a strawman argument.  You string several things, assumptions, together with the final assumption being that they are relevant to each other, when, besides being false, they are not connected anywhere except in your fevered mind.  I have shown where YOUR logic has failed or is not present.  Show me where mine has failed.</p>

			<p>DocNeaves said:<br />
“Capital gains rates are twenty to twenty eight percent.”</p>
<p>From BankRate.com:<br />
“Currently, capital gains are at historic lows. Some taxpayers in the two lowest tax brackets could end up without any capital gains tax bill. That&#8217;s right, zero capital gains for some filers.</p>
<p>“Others will face tax rates of just 5 percent. Most investors will see their gains taxed at 15 percent. And 25 percent and 28 percent rates apply in special circumstances.</p>
<p>“A rate of 25 percent applies to part of the gain from selling real estate you depreciated. Basically this keeps you from getting a double tax break. The Internal Revenue Service first wants to recapture some of the tax breaks you&#8217;ve been getting via depreciation throughout the years.</p>
<p>“If you realized a gain from qualified small-business stock that you held more than five years, you generally can exclude one-half of your gain from income. The remainder is taxed at a 28 percent rate.</p>
<p>“If your gains came from collectibles rather than a business sale, you&#8217;ll still pay the 28 percent rate.”<br />
 <a href="http://www.bankrate.com/finance/money-guides/capital-gains-tax-rates-1.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.bankrate.com/finance/money-guides/capital-gains-tax-rates-1.aspx</a></p>
<p>DocNeaves said:<br />
“ ‘If I earn $20,000, I pay taxes on that, and if I then hire someone and pay them $20,000, they pay a tax on that. They didn’t pay my taxes, and I didn’t pay theirs. The money goes around, and it gets earned (and taxed) multiple times year year.’</p>
<p>“Keynsian bullshit. If you earn twenty thousand, you pay taxes. You then hire someone, how are you going to pay them twenty grand? You have twenty grand minus the taxes. Then you pay him whatever you have left, he pays taxes, eventually, the pool shrinks. Got it?”</p>
<p>First, if you earn twenty thousand, you aren’t going to hire anyone you will pay twenty thousand – except in extreme emergency. And even then it will require borrowing. </p>
<p>Second, usually if you pay anyone that much in one year, you are probably much better off than twenty grand a year, and the reason you are paying him anything falls into one of three groups:</p>
<p>1. It is something you don’t want to do yourself (example: gardener, cook, etc.).<br />
2. It is something you don’t know how to do yourself (auto mechanic).<br />
3. You, as an employer, are paying him twenty thousand a year because he, as an employee, adds considerably more to your income than you pay him (you own a restaurant and he is on wait staff).</p>
<p>DocNeaves said:<br />
“[E]ventually, the pool shrinks.”</p>
<p>Yet in your first post, you said, “It’s not a zero sum game.” And you are right: It’s not. </p>
<p>In the restaurant example, other people, because of this other person’s labor, are bringing much more cash into your world than you are paying out to him. Twenty thousand a year works out to roughly $385 per week. If he works five six-hour nights a week, you fork over to him $77 for serving up, say, $500 worth of food.</p>
<p>Now that is capitalism. You have up-front costs (labor) for which he produces more value than you are paying him for (customers’ tab) and you keep the rest. Marx called it “surplus value.”</p>
<p>All Marx really did was examine capitalism and point out how people got rich by paying those whose labor made them rich only the minimum of what they would be willing to work for. The rest, except for some certain other expenses, is where the profit comes from: The production of value to you that you didn&#8217;t pay out to the one who actually produced it.</p>

			<p>Sorry, I didn&#8217;t allow for special situations and deductions.  I was talking about the rates themselves, which you have proven accurate.  Thanks for proving me right.</p>
<p>As to the second part, we were talking in simple terms, only allowing for the cash flow.  If you want to take all of that other into consideration, fine, but it still doesn&#8217;t change anything, just muddies the waters.  So, in two tries, you&#8217;ve agreed with me, and mumbled.  Not a good start to a rebuttal.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s where you really get lost:</p>
<p>“[E]ventually, the pool shrinks.”</p>
<p>Yet in your first post, you said, “It’s not a zero sum game.” And you are right: It’s not. </p>
<p>What was meant by &#8220;not a zero sum game&#8221; is that when you raise taxes by ten percent, you won&#8217;t get ten percent increases, because there will be considerable revenue lost from tax avoidance.  Tax REITs, and people will invest in them less, causing a net loss in revenues.  Of course, you don&#8217;t understand this, and are trying to take any of my words to use against me, so you take it out of context in this next part:</p>
<p>&#8220;In the restaurant example, other people, because of this other person’s labor, are bringing much more cash into your world than you are paying out to him. Twenty thousand a year works out to roughly $385 per week. If he works five six-hour nights a week, you fork over to him $77 for serving up, say, $500 worth of food.&#8221;</p>
<p>That extra value comes not just from his labor, but also from the purchase of the food, the labor of the guy who cooked it, the labor of the cleaning staff, the cost of the building, and the cost of investing in it in the first place.  You would like to say we&#8217;re stealing from that waiter, but that&#8217;s because you are a whiny little marxist.  If you were to admit reality, you would not invest a hundred grand in a restaurant, not knowing if you&#8217;ll make money or not, only to have ANY profit you make seized, distributed amongst those whose wages were guaranteed.  Why?  Because you worship Marxism, the lie told hundreds of years ago, that promises you that you can have a free lunch.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now that is capitalism. You have up-front costs (labor) for which he produces more value than you are paying him for (customers’ tab) and you keep the rest. Marx called it “surplus value.”</p>
<p>Marx lied.  It&#8217;s called profit, and it comes from much more than that worker&#8217;s labor.</p>
<p>&#8220;All Marx really did was examine capitalism and point out how people got rich by paying those whose labor made them rich only the minimum of what they would be willing to work for. The rest, except for some certain other expenses, is where the profit comes from: The production of value to you that you didn’t pay out to the one who actually produced it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, he lies.  What about the profit owed to you for investing your money?  The laboring had no risk, he worked, and got paid.  The person who risked their money should get paid, too.  But of course, you want to sit around and do nothing, which means you can&#8217;t get paid what your worth or you&#8217;d get nothing.</p>
<p>If you think that you are right, then do this.  Find a worker who is out of a job.  Tell him to produce something, without giving him any specific ideas, plans or drawings, or even specific items to make, and give him no money, tools, or materials.  Let&#8217;s see what he makes, how much he sells it for, and how much is left over when he&#8217;s done.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m betting he&#8217;ll just starve.</p>
<p>Because anyone who believes in Marx is a moron incapable of rational thought.</p>

			<p>Just curious&#8230;.you DID know that Marx and Engels were paid to write that crap, right?  Communism, socialism, that was invented whole cloth by the Rothschilds and the World Banking group, in order to repress people and own their money.  You really should read about it.  The check Rothschild wrote Marx is supposedly in a museum in England somewhere.  Imagine, an entire socio-economic system devised for the sole purpose of taking over the world.  Whoda thunk it.</p>
