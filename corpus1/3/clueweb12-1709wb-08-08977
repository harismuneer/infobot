					<p>We were delighted when <em>The Independent</em> newspaper chose to feature one of our exclusive <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/christmas10/chrgif/ultimate-christmas-gift-guide-part-one-2136872.html?action=Gallery&amp;ino=165" target="_blank">Red Star dog tags in its Christmas gift guide</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Red Star dog tags make a great, personalised gift for your dog &#8211; a  lovely way too to convey how you feel about your dog, or to capture your  dog&#8217;s attitude to life!  And because we stamp your contact details on  the back they are not only fun, but practical too.</p>

				<small>Wednesday, November 3rd, 2010</small>

				<div class="entry">
					<p>[PLEASE NOTE THIS COMPETITION IS NOW CLOSED.]</p>
<p>We’re pretty excited to announce that next week we are running our first-ever <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Merry-Dogs/189330065271?v=wall&amp;filter=1#!/pages/Merry-Dogs/189330065271" target="_blank">Facebook photo contest</a>. The <em>*fabulous*</em> prize is a <a href="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/department/leather_dog_collars/">Creature Clothes leather collar</a>. Any colour, any design. Winner’s choice. What dog doesn’t need an extra collar?!</p>
<p>There’s also a ‘Pot Luck’ prize of a <a href="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/product/_king_crab_tuffy_dog_toy/">Tuffy Crab</a> – all entries go in the Pot Luck pot, so it is definitely worth entering!</p>
<p>So,… to the rules:</p>
<p>– The theme is: ‘My, what big teeth you have…Mr/s Wolf!’</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-813" href="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/blog/merry-dogs-news/win-a-creature-clothes-collar-in-our-first-ever-facebook-photo-contest/attachment/tiny-chihuahua-with-mouth-wide-open-ears-back-2/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-813" title="&quot;What big teeth you have...Mr/s Wolf!&quot;" src="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/What-big-teeth1.jpg" alt="" width="376" height="319" /></a></p>
<p>– Post your dog’s photo on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Merry-Dogs/189330065271?v=wall&amp;filter=1#!/pages/Merry-Dogs/189330065271" target="_blank">Merry Dogs Facebook page</a>. Make sure it bears a vague resemblance to the theme…though we are not too strict!  Funny is good, as is sincere. Small teeth are as welcome as big teeth! All entries must feature a dog and be your own original composition.</p>
<p>– There are two ways you can win:</p>
<p>1. To win the collar – The photo with the most comments wins (one comment per person per day) – note, that is COMMENTS** and not likes.</p>
<p>2. Pot Luck – all entries go in the Pot Luck pot, regardless of artistic merit or power to amuse, and the first to come back out wins a Tuffy Crab.</p>
<p>So, get your friends, family, forum buddies and workmates commenting on their favourite pic (yours, of course). And why not be sportsmanlike, and comment on any other entries that catch your eye!</p>
<p>– The contest runs from Monday 8 November 00.01 am to Friday 12 November, 9pm.  The winners will be announced on Monday 15 November.</p>
<p>Good luck, and happy snapping&#8230;!</p>
<p>** Comments = words, phrases and exclamations that make sense!</p>

<p>A labradoodle bitch from New York who goes by the name of Martin has  been dazzling the city in recent months with her amazing feats of  balance and artistry.  We couldn&#8217;t resist calling her up for one of our five-minute interviews, to find out more about this skilled performance  artist.</p>
<p><strong>MD: Hi Martin, welcome to the Merry Dogs blog. Can you tell us a little about what first inspired you to take to the sky?</strong><br />
Martin:  Sure.  I started jumping atop things for the view.  I&#8217;ve always  wished I was taller, basically.</p>

<p><strong>MD: What&#8217;s your favourite balance, where&#8217;d you perform it, and what made it so special?</strong><br />
Martin:  Oh, I don&#8217;t know, it doesn&#8217;t much matter to me where I stand.   I&#8217;m really only interested in making a good photograph, and that&#8217;s so  subjective isn&#8217;t it?  I do tend to prefer the ones where my tongue is  sticking out.</p>

<p><strong>MD: What artistic and practical challenges have you faced when choosing your performance space?</strong><br />
Martin:  Gravity can be a big problem.  That&#8217;s the main challenge.</p>

<p><strong>MD: Where in the world would you most like to balance, and why?</strong><br />
Martin:  I&#8217;m quite partial to my living room couch, but nobody seems to  be very interested in pictures of that!  Hmm, you&#8217;re in the UK?  I  suppose I wouldn&#8217;t mind trying my luck with Nelson&#8217;s Column someday!</p>

Finely decorated with brass cattle and farmers,  they show great workmanship and design, and clearly belonged to valued  working dogs. In fact they are designed for Greater Swiss Mountain Dogs,  a breed that is rare in the UK.</p>

<p>The Swiss Mountain Dog is  a tricolour, short-coated breed and one of the 10 largest dog breeds, the males weighing about 140lb (64kgs). It is both strong and athletic, and is believed to have been instrumental in the development of both the Rottweiler and the St Bernard.  Common in Switzerland in the nineteenth century, it was used by farmers and tradesmen to guard farms, herd cattle and pull carts.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Swiss collars were hand-crafted in the Appenzell region   of Switzerland and used for the colourful cattle drives that took place   in the Summer and Autumn. Herdsmen would wear their best &#8216;tracht&#8217; or   traditional dress and their dog, usually the Swiss Mountain Dog, would   be decorated with collars such as these. The cattle would be adorned  with colourful traicheln or glocken (alpine cowbells) for their  journey  up the mountain and back again at the end of the season.<a rel="attachment wp-att-550" href="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/blog/world-of-dogs/beautiful-working-dog-collars-from-another-age/attachment/gsmd2/"><br />

				<div class="entry">
					<p>One of the best things about dog-ownership is that you can take your dog out and about with you.  Cats, rabbits, birds and horses mostly have to stay at home, but dogs love to go with you, wherever you go.</p>
<p>As we are feeling in the holiday mood we thought we&#8217;d highlight some of our great summer products:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-479" title="SPA ON THE GO" src="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/MDHP-SOTG-B.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="368" /></p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/product/dog_grooming_travel_kit_happy_tails/" target="_self">dog grooming travel kit</a> has to be sniffed to be believed &#8211; fresh, natural scents including rosemary, lavender and peppermint. In this handy re-usable pouch you&#8217;ll find  anti-itch oatmeal shampoo, fur butter deep conditioner, a de-tangling spritzer and an aromatic mister for smelly-dog emergencies.</p>
<p>Everyone likes a new outfit for their holiday, and we have just what your dog needs to impress the girls (or boys)! How about our <a href="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/product/_beach_stripe_a_canvas_collar_by_creature_clothes/" target="_self">Beach stripe fabric dog collars</a>:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-498" title="BEACH STRIPE COLLAR" src="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/MDCC-BSA-c-B-txt-300x240.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="240" /></p>
<p>For even the shortest trip you need to make sure water is available, and our water bowls will fit a range of activities:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-480" title="PLANET DOG TRAVEL BOWL" src="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/PD-Tbowl-B-400x400.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="240" /></p>
<p>Planet Dog <a href="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/product/travel_bowl_by_planet_dog/" target="_self">foldable dog travel bowl</a> is a fabric bowl in 2 sizes that is ideal for bags and backpacks.  There is also a <a href="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/product/travel_bag_for_dogs_by_planet_dog/" target="_self">matching travel food bag</a>, that can be used for food, treats, doggy bags &#8211; great for gathering all your dog&#8217;s bits &amp; pieces in one place.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-481" title="TAZLAB TRAVEL BOWL" src="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/MDTL-red-B.jpg" alt="" width="276" height="221" /></p>
<p>The Tazlab Aqua-fur <a href="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/product/aqua-fur_foldable_travel_dog_bowl_tazlab/" target="_self">foldable travel dog bowl</a> is flexible, foldable and lightweight, but opens up to look like a traditional bowl, so is ideal for dogs that don&#8217;t take to fabric bowls.  It&#8217;s made from food-grade silicon and comes in some great colours.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-482" title="Road refresher " src="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/Road-refresher-B.jpg" alt="" width="322" height="258" /></p>
<p>If you are travelling any distance by car, the <a href="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/product/_road_refresher_non-spill_dog_water_bowl/" target="_self">Road Refresher dog bowl</a> can be placed in with your dog and its anti-spill technology means the water stays in the bowl when you corner!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-483" title="KATIE'S BUMPERS DOUBLE TUG" src="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/KBdt-B.jpg" alt="" width="276" height="221" /></p>
<p>And of course holiday time is fun time, so you&#8217;ll need some dog-friendly, hardwearing toys &#8211; <a href="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/product/double_tug_dog_toy_katie_s_bumpers/" target="_self">Katie&#8217;s Bumpers tug toys </a>are lightweight, ideal for carrying, and can be used for tugging, throwing and retrieving. Planet Dog&#8217;s colourful <a href="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/product/orbee_dog_ball_by_planet_dog/" target="_self">dog balls</a> are bouncy, chewy and mint-scented, just right for chasing and catching.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-493" title="PLANET DOG BALLS" src="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/MDPD-Orb-2Balls-B-300x204.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="204" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Have a great summer!</p>

<p>Bullies have THE most fantastic doggy smiles!  Merry Dogs recently sponsored a photo competition on the <a href="http://forum.bullbreedsonline.com/index/" target="_blank">Bull Breeds Online</a> web forum, for which the theme was &#8216;Biggest smile&#8217;.  The winner, shown above, was Captain (owned by Lynn and Jim Caswell), who was sadly lost in an accident in 2009.</p>
<p>As a tribute to Captain, the prize (a <a href="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/product/_celtic_leather_dog_collar_by_paco_collars_m_l_/" target="_self">Celtic leather collar</a>) is to be worn by their bitch Nealie, who looks particularly beautiful modelling it here.</p>

Joining celebrities and VIPs were the hirsute winners of five  categories, chosen from over 300 entrants from across the UK.</p>
<p>Guests  enjoyed nibbles and kibbles galore at the glitzy ceremony, which tool  place at London’s Jasmine Studios. The event was created by Dogs Trust,  the UK’s largest dog welfare charity, to spotlight the countless ways in  which dogs enrich our lives.</p>
<p>Among those attending were JoAnne Good and Anna Webb (left), of &#8216;Barking at the Moon&#8217;, BBC Radio London&#8217;s doggy radio feature.  Anna&#8217;s dog Molly looked dressed for the part in her <a href="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/product/_milan_heart_leather_dog_collar_by_paco_collars_m_l_/" target="_blank">Paco Collars &#8216;Hearts&#8217; design collar and lead</a>!</p>
<p>Speaking at the awards, Clarissa  Baldwin, Dogs Trust CEO, said:</p>
<p>“Dogs  are so often the unsung heroes of peoples’ lives, and the Honours pays  tribute to all those magnificent mutts who make life more joyful. It’s a  world away from the traditional dog show &#8211; in fact it’s more like a hairy  hybrid of The Pride of Britain awards and the Oscars. The Honours shows  that canine beauty really is all about the heart.”</p>
<p>And the  winners are:</p>
<p><strong>The Sun Hero Dog Award &#8211; For acts of bravery  including dogs from the police and armed forces<br />
</strong>This will be  announced soon in The Sun &#8211; keep your eyes peeled!</p>

</strong>Treacle was rehomed from Dogs Trust Kenilworth  and is the constant companion of seven year old Jasmine Dowd, who has to  undergo 12 hours of dialysis, as well as tube-feeding, every night.  Amid the machinery and medicine lies Treacle, her best friend. Jasmine  is able to sleep through all of her treatment as long as Treacle is on  her bed, providing plenty of fun and cuddles.</p>
<p><strong><a rel="attachment wp-att-411" href="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/blog/world-of-dogs/dogs-trust-honours-2010/attachment/tim_win/"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-411" title="tim_win" src="http://www.merrydogs.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/tim_win.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="120" /></a>Technik  Technology Golden Oldie Award – a lifetime achievement award for dogs  over seven years<br />
</strong>Sadly, this year’s winner is a posthumous one,  as 15 year old Tim died just two weeks before the Honours. He is sorely  missed by owner Lorraine Coultas and all the staff and residents at  Meadowlodge in North Yorkshire. Labrador Tim lived in a residential home  where he was a great comfort to the elderly residents, many of whom  have Alzheimer’s disease or dementia. He also knew when someone was in  extra need of attention and used to lay right beside them, sleeping in  their room if necessary.</p>

Owner Robert Stuhldreer sent Adora to audition when  he spotted an advert in his local paper and, despite having had no  prior acting experience, Adora impressed the producers and won the role.</p>
