This year's RISC OS London show was an exciting one. The major talking point was news that the &pound;16 <A HREF="http://www.RaspberryPi.org/" TITLE="to Raspberry Pi website"  >Raspberry&nbsp;Pi</A> computer will launch in December running both Linux and, as an alternative, RISC&nbsp;OS. RISCOScode interviewed Theo Markettos and Adrian Lees, two key players in bringing Raspberry&nbsp;Pi with RISC&nbsp;OS to market. Our report also features edited tweets from the day and exclusive photographs.<BR>

Good morning and welcome to the live twitter feed from the London RISC OS show featuring Raspberry Pi. <BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">08:09</FONT><BR>
The plan today is to report live from the exhibition hall and show theatre. By all means join in the chatter. Tag is #ROLS.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">08:11</FONT><BR>
I'm currently in the car park at the venue; St Giles Hotel in Hounslow Road, Feltham, London TW14 9AD. Time to go snoop.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>(This paragraph updated, 2am, 1st Nov 2011)<BR>
What a great start to the day. I'd managed to interview Theo Markettos and tweet the interview as it proceeded. Theo is a postdoctoral researcher at Cambridge University. Although he has no formal direct connection with the Raspberry&nbsp;Pi foundation he shares offices at the University with people who do. Keen to make the point that any views expressed today were his rather than Raspberry Pi's he none-the-less has an impressive grasp of both the Raspberry&nbsp;Pi and RISC&nbsp;OS. I spoke to him at the Raspberry Pi stall where he presided over the precious alpha developbent boards one of which was running a software authoring package for primary school kids called <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)" TITLE="to information about Scratch"  >Scratch.</A> As this is not available for RISC&nbsp;OS it prompted me ask Theo if he thought RISC&nbsp;OS software was up to the job of appealing to users of Raspberry&nbsp;Pi. It's probably accurate to summarise his response as being that the Raspberry&nbsp;Pi is intended to get developers rethinking the whole approach to how children and young adults can be enticed and excited by a computing device. The best software for the Raspberry&nbsp;Pi has yet to be written. He pointed out that when booted the Raspberry Pi will go to a prompt like &quot;&gt;&quot; on the thirty year old BBCmicro. This will force users to interface with the machine in a programming manner and think of it as something to be commanded at a fundamental level rather than just used. At that stage, he suggested, the user could type in &quot;Run RISC OS&quot; or &quot;Run Linux&quot;, for example. </I></H3>

Technical glitch sorted, Andrew's now in full presentational flow. Andrew: &quot;Did you know that the ARMini/BeagleBoard has hardware floating point? Not much RISC&nbsp;OS software makes use of this&quot;.<BR>

Adrian Lees representing Broadcom has arrived. He's demonstrating RISC&nbsp;OS running on the Raspberry Pi right now. WOO - HOO !&nbsp; <I>He's sidestepped the lack of RISC OS keyboard and mouse drivers by using a serial port connected netbook to feed mouse and keyboard input from the netbook to the Raspberry Pi running RISC OS. Adrian's comment, &quot;This netbook is the most expensive mouse &amp; keyboard I've bought&quot;.</I><BR>

Just shook hands with a fellow twitterer at the show, Robin Hodson. He spotted me twittering.<BR>
&nbsp;</H3>
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="../Images/ROLS2011/USBdrive.jpg" ALT="ROOL USB pen drive with RISC OS pre-loaded. (c) RISCOScode, 201" WIDTH="620" HEIGHT="519" BORDER="0"></H3>
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>At this point in the show I spoke with <A HREF="http://www.7thSoftware.co.uk/index.htm" TITLE="to Steve's 7th Software website"  >Steve Revill,</A> and later with <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RISC_OS_Open" TITLE="to wikipedia page on ROOL"  >Ben Avison,</A> both of RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;Open Ltd. ROOL had an amazing new product on sale to which my rushed tweets at the time did not do justice. Rather than reproduce them, let me better summarise our conversations here. <BR>
&quot;One of the problems that newcomers to RISC OS have faced in the past is the level of technical expertise needed to get a RISC&nbsp;OS emulator running on a Microsoft or Apple powered computer. ROOL have addressed this issue and today launch a USB stick from which RISC&nbsp;OS can be effortlessly run on such machines. The attractively packaged USB stick costs &pound;10. No further costs are involved. Insert into the host computer, follow simple instructions, and RISC&nbsp;OS will run in a desktop window. It has never been easier or cheaper to try out RISC OS. With RISC&nbsp;OS about to be available on the Raspberry&nbsp;Pi this is a timely moment to be making it easy for potential new coders and developers to play around with RISC OS. We believe this USB pen drive pre-loaded with RISC&nbsp;OS does this. A version for BeagleBoard users is also available for &pound;10.&quot; <BR>
There, I went into &quot;Press Release&quot; mode, and also took the ace &quot;publicity shot&quot; of the pen drive. All this by way of an apology for messing up the tweets on the day. </I></H3>

&nbsp;<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">14:24</FONT><BR>
First 10 000 Raspberry Pi are being *fabricated* (correction) right now. Manufacture in about two weeks time will be at an undisclosed location. Definitely out before Christmas.<BR>
&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">14:31</FONT><BR>
Flat out the Raspberry Pi consumes 2 watts. Mostly it's happy with 0.5 watts. So much computing for so little energy.<BR>
&nbsp;</H3>
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><IMG SRC="../Images/ROLS2011/Adrian.jpg" ALT="Adrian Lees at ROLS. (c) RISCOScode, 2011" WIDTH="620" HEIGHT="430" BORDER="0"></H3>
<H3 ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Immediately after the Raspberry Pi theatre talk I interviewed Adrian Lees. I quizzed him about the process of manufacturing the Raspberry Pi prompted by an earlier comment that the board was being fabricated right now. I had taken this to mean &quot;10&nbsp;000 rolling off the production line&quot;. He laughed at this and explained, &quot;You don't press a button and thereby commit to manufacturing 10&nbsp;000 units. Despite the best endeavours of all concerned, there may remain a bug or design flaw. You'd have 10&nbsp;000 useless units. The silicon comes off large cylinders and you book a row or two in one of these for your device amongst all sorts of other stuff. If what you get from the silicon foundry behaves as you expect, you give the go ahead for more of your 10&nbsp;000 unit order. However, you expect minor problems. Or while waiting for a batch of your order to arrive, you may have tweeked the design. If the alteration is major, in that logic gates need repositioning, then you move to revision A or B. The trick is to have built into the device ways of debugging and accessing what is going on. The BeagleBoard, for example, is now on revision C. Sometimes just the connections in the top layer or two of the silicon need rewiring. That's a minor revision. Say revision A1. So the first 10&nbsp;000 Raspberry&nbsp;Pi will arrive in batches, production ramping up once we're confident all is well and as demand dictates&quot;.<BR>
Note: This all from memory. I hope I've represented well the clarity with which Adrian patiently explained all this to me. Any errors will be down to me but I don't think I can cope with trying to record conversations along with tweeting, taking photos and running my own stall ;-)</I></H3>

The RISC OS London show has finished. Hope you have enjoyed the RISCOScode coverage featuring Raspberry Pi.<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
<I>I will conclude by explaining why I've not covered a lot of the exhibitors and exhibits that were at the show. Before writing this, I waited a day to see how the <A HREF="http://riscos.blog.com/" TITLE="to RISCOSblog"  >RISCOSblog</A> and <A HREF="http://www.RISCOSitory.com/" TITLE="to RISCOSitory website"  >RISCOSitory</A> wrote up the show. Then, so that the RISCOScode report would be different, I decided to focus in depth on three key exhibitors, Raspberry Pi, ROOL, and R-Comp. I am aware that there were many talks and projects being presented that are of great importance to various groups of RISC OS enthusiasts but which are not mentioned here. This time, however, I've focussed on what I feel will be of immediate interest to those looking at RISC&nbsp;OS for the first time. Once new developers and new users are enticed in, they will find much else to enjoy from RISC OS. At the present time however, the Raspberry Pi has given RISC&nbsp;OS a fantastic opportunity to welcome in much needed new blood. I hope those left out this time will understand. Finally, if you are on twitter, you can help spread the word about RISC&nbsp;OS on the Raspberry&nbsp;Pi by using the tweet button below right.</I><BR>
