                           <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif size=2>Born in Camden, South Carolina in 1822, <a href="http://thomaslegion.net/general_joseph_kershaw.html" target="tlx_new"><font  color="black"><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>Joseph Brevard Kershaw</FONT></font></a> enjoyed a&nbsp;flourishing law practice in Camden before he volunteered to serve with South Carolina troops during the War
                           with Mexico. He returned to his law practice and served for a time in the state legislature. In 1860, Kershaw was nominated
                           to serve as a state representative in the secession convention of 1860 and began his Civil War career as colonel of the 2nd
                           South Carolina Volunteers.&nbsp;Colonel Kershaw had limited military training when he&nbsp;assumed command. With his assistant
                           commanders, the 2nd became one of the better trained regiments in southern service. Kershaw also proved to be one of the <a href="http://thomaslegion.net/armyofnorthernvirginia.html" target="tlx_new"><font  color="black"><FONT color=#0000ff>Army of Northern Virginia's</FONT></font></a> finest officers. During the&nbsp;<a href="http://thomaslegion.net/battleofgettysburg.html" target="tlx_new"><font  color="black"><FONT color=#0000ff>Battle of Gettysburg</FONT></font></a>, Kershaw was a brigadier general leading a South Carolina Brigade in McLaw's Division of <a href="http://thomaslegion.net/generallongstreetscommandjuly3.html" target="tlx_new"><font  color="black"><FONT color=#0000ff>Longstreet's Corps</FONT></font></a>. His regiments fought in the woods and fields of the George Rose farm and were swept up in the "whirlpool" of the <a href="http://thomaslegion.net/battleofgettysburgthewheatfield.html" target="tlx_new"><font  color="black"><FONT color=#0000ff>Wheatfield</FONT></font></a>. Twenty years after the battle, there was an ongoing debate as to why the Confederacy had lost at Gettysburg. In reply to
                           the many critics and notions of military mismanagement, an aged Kershaw wrote a brief article for <I>Century Magazine</I>
                           on his brigade's participation in this monumental battle:</FONT></P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
                           <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif size=2>"My brigade, composed of South Carolinians, constituted, with Semmes's, Wofford's,
                           and Barksdale's brigades, the division of Major General Lafayette McLaws. About sunset on the 1st of July we reached the top
                           of a range of hills overlooking Gettysburg, from which could be seen and heard the smoke and din of battle then raging in
                           the distance. We encamped two miles from Gettysburg, on the left of the Chambersburg Pike. On the 2d we were up and ready
                           to move at 4 A.M. in obedience to orders, but, owing as we understood at the time to the occupancy of the road by trains of
                           the Second Corps, did not march until about sunrise. With only a slight detention from trains in the way, we reached the high
                           grounds near Gettysburg and moved to the right of the Third Corps, (my) brigade being at the head of the column. At length,
                           General McLaws ordered me to move by a flank to the rear, get under the cover of the hill, and move along the bank of Marsh
                           Creek toward the enemy, taking care to keep out of their view. In executing this order, we passed the Black Horse Tavern and
                           followed the road leading from that point toward the Emmitsburg Pike, until the head of the column reached a point where the
                           road passed over the top of a hill, from which our movement would have been plainly visible from the Federal signal station
                           at <a href="http://thomaslegion.net/coloneljoshuachamberlain.html" target="tlx_new"><font  color="black"><FONT color=#0000ff>Little Round Top</FONT></font></a>. Here we were halted by General McLaws in person, while he and <a href="http://thomaslegion.net/general_james_longstreet.html" target="tlx_new"><font  color="black"><FONT color=#0000ff size=2>General&nbsp;Longstreet</FONT></font></a> rode forward to reconnoiter. Very soon those gentlemen returned, both manifesting considerable irritation as I thought. General
                           McLaws ordered me to countermarch and in doing so we passed <a href="http://thomaslegion.net/generaljohnbellhood.html" target="tlx_new"><font  color="black"><FONT color=#0000ff>Hood's division</FONT></font></a>, which had been following us. We moved back to the place where we had rested during the morning and thence by a country road
                           to Willoughby Run&#8230; and down to that school house beyond <a href="http://thomaslegion.net/battleofgettysburgpitzerwoods.html" target="tlx_new"><font  color="black"><FONT color=#0000ff>Pitzer's</FONT></font></a> (farm)."</FONT></P>
                           <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif size=2>"General Longstreet here commanded me to advance with my brigade and attack
                           the enemy at the <a href="http://thomaslegion.net/battleofgettysburgthepeachorchard.html" target="tlx_new"><font  color="black"><FONT color=#0000ff>Peach Orchard</FONT></font></a>, which lay a little to the left of my line of march, some six hundred yards in front of us. I was directed to turn the flank
                           of that position, extend my line along the road we were then in beyond the Emmitsburg pike, with my left resting on that road.
                           At 3 P.M. the head of my column emerged from the woods and came into the open field in front of the stone wall which extends
                           along by Flaherty's farm and to the east past Snyder's (farm).</FONT>

                           supported by artillery, and extended from that point toward our left along the Emmitsburg Road. The intervening ground was
                           occupied by open fields, interspersed and divided by stone walls. I immediately formed line of battle along the stone wall...
                           done under cover of my skirmishers, who engaged those of the enemy near the Emmitsburg Road. In the meantime I examined the
                           position of the Federals with some care. I found them in superior force, strongly posted in the Peach Orchard, which bristled
                           with artillery, with a main line of battle in their rear... and extending to if not upon, Little Round Top. I placed my command
                           in position under cover of the stone wall, and communicated the condition of matters to Major General McLaws. The division
                           was then formed on this line, Semmes's brigade two hundred yards in rear and supporting Kershaw's; Barksdale's on the left
                           of (mine) with Wofford's in Barksdale's rear supporting him. Cabell's battalion of artillery was placed along the wall to
                           (my brigade's) right, and the 15<SUP>th</SUP> South Carolina Regiment, Colonel (William D.) de Saussure, was thrown to their
                           right to support them on that flank. In the meantime General Hood's division was moving in our rear to the right, to gain
                           the enemy's left flank, and I was directed to commence the attack as soon as General Hood became engaged, swinging around
                           the Peach Orchard, and at the same time establishing connection with Hood on my right, and cooperating with him.</FONT>

                           <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif size=2>"In my center-front was a stone farm-house (Rose's) with a barn also of stone.
                           These buildings were about five hundred yards from our position and on a line with the crest of the Peach Orchard hill. The
                           Federal infantry was posted along the front of the orchard, and also on the face looking toward Rose's. Six of their batteries
                           were in position, three at the orchard near the crest of the hill, and the others about two hundred yards in rear... Behind
                           Rose's was a morass and on the right of that, a stone wall running parallel with our line, some two hundred yards from Rose's.
                           Beyond the morass was a stony hill covered with heavy timber and thick undergrowth, interspersed with boulders and large fragments
                           of rock extending some distance toward the Federal line... (by) which a narrow road led in the direction of (Little Round
                           Top). Looking down this road from Rose's a large wheat-field was seen. In rear of the wheat-field... a heavy force of Federals
                           (were) posted in line behind a stone wall. About 4 o'clock I received the order to move, at a signal from Cabell's artillery.
                           They were to fire for some minutes, then pause, and then fire three guns in rapid succession. At this time I was to move without
                           further orders. I communicated these instructions to the commanders of each of the regiments in my command, directing them
                           to convey (these orders) to the company officers. They were told, at the signal, to order the men to leap the wall... and
                           to align the troops in front of it. Accordingly, at the signal, the men leaped over the wall and were properly aligned; the
                           word was given and the brigade moved off... with great steadiness and precision, followed by Semmes with equal promptness.
                           General Longstreet accompanied me in this advance on foot as far as the Emmitsburg Road. All the field and staff officers
                           were dismounted on account of many obstacles in the way. When we were about the Emmitsburg Road, I heard Barksdale's drums
                           beat the assembly, and knew then that I should have no immediate support on my left. The 2<SUP>nd</SUP> and 8<SUP>th</SUP>
                           South Carolina regiments and James's (Third) Battalion constituted the left wing of the brigade and were then moving majestically
                           across the fields to the left of the lane leading to Rose's with the steadiness of troops on parade. They were ordered to
                           change direction to the left and attack the batteries in rear of the Peach Orchard, and accordingly moved rapidly on that
                           point. In order to aid this attack, the direction of the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> and 7<SUP>th</SUP> regiments was changed to the left
                           so as to occupy the stony hill and wood. After passing the buildings at Rose's, the charge of the left wing was no longer
                           visible from my position; but the movement was reported to have been magnificently conducted... when the order was given to
                           'move by the right flank,' by some unauthorized person, and was immediately obeyed by the men. The Federals... opened on these
                           doomed regiments a raking fire of grape and canister at short distance, which proved most disastrous, and for a time destroyed
                           their usefulness. Hundreds of the bravest and best men of Carolina fell, victims of this fatal blunder. While this tragedy
                           was being enacted, the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> and 7<SUP>th</SUP> regiments were conducted rapidly to the stony hill. In consequence
                           of the obstructions in the way, the 7<SUP>th</SUP> regiment had lapped the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> a few paces, and when they reached
                           the cover of the stony hill I halted the line at the edge of the wood for a moment, and ordered the 7<SUP>th</SUP> to move
                           by the right flank to uncover the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> Regiment, which was promptly done. It was, no doubt, this movement observed
                           by some one from the left, that led to the terrible mistake which cost so dearly.</FONT></P>
                           <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif size=2>"The... 7<SUP>th</SUP> and 3<SUP>rd</SUP> regiments advanced into the wood
                           and occupied the stony hill, the left of the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> Regiment swinging around and attacking the batteries to the left
                           of that position. Very soon a heavy column moved in two lines of battle across the wheat-field to attack my position in such
                           manner as to take the 7<SUP>th</SUP> Regiment in flank on the right. The right wing of this regiment was then thrown back
                           to meet this attack. I then hurried in person to General Semmes, then 150 yards in my right rear, to bring him up to meet
                           the attack on my right and also to bring forward my right regiment, the 15<SUP>th</SUP>, commanded by Colonel W. (D.) deSaussure,
                           which... was cut off by Semmes's brigade. In the act of leading his regiment, the gallant and accomplished commander of the
                           15<SUP>th</SUP> had just fallen when I reached it. He fell some paces in front of the line, with sword drawn, leading their
                           advance. General Semmes promptly responded to my call, and put his brigade in motion toward the right, preparatory to moving
                           to the front. While his troops were moving, he fell, mortally wounded. Returning to the 7<SUP>th</SUP> Regiment, I reached
                           it just as the advancing column of Federals had arrived at a point some two hundred yards off, whence they poured into us
                           a volley from their whole line and advanced to the charge. They were handsomely received and entertained by this veteran regiment,
                           which long kept them at bay in front. One regiment in Semmes's brigade came at a double quick as far as the ravine in our
                           rear, and checked the advance of the Federals in their front. There was still an interval on a hundred yards&#8230; between
                           this regiment and the right of the 7<SUP>th</SUP>, and into this the enemy was forcing his way, causing my right to swing
                           back more and more; still fighting, at a distance not exceeding thirty paces, until the two wings of the regiment were nearly
                           doubled on each other.</FONT></P>
                           <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif size=2>"The enemy&#8230; swung around and lapped my whole line at close quarters,
                           and the fighting was general and desperate all along the line, and so continued for some time. These men were brave veterans
                           who had fought from Bull Run to Gettysburg, and knew the strength of their position and so held it as long as it was tenable.
                           The 7<SUP>th</SUP> Regiment finally gave way, and I directed Colonel (David) Aiken to re-form it at the stone wall about Roses's.
                           I passed to the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> Regiment, then hotly engaged on the crest of the ill, and gradually swung back its right as
                           the enemy made progress around that flank. Semmes's advanced regiment had given way. One of his regiments had mingled with
                           the 3<SUP>rd</SUP> and amid rocks and trees, within a few feet of each other, these brave men, Confederates and Federals,
                           maintained a desperate conflict. The enemy could make no progress in front, but slowly extended around my right. Separated
                           from view of my left&#8230; the position of the 15<SUP>th</SUP> Regiment being wholly unknown, the 7<SUP>th</SUP> having retreated,
                           and nothing being heard of the other troops of the division, I feared the brave men around me would be surrounded by the large
                           force of the enemy constantly increasing in numbers and all the while gradually enveloping us. In order to avoid such a catastrophe,
                           I ordered a retreat to the buildings at Rose's. On emerging from the wood as I followed the retreat, I saw Wofford riding
                           at the head of his fine brigade then coming in, his left being in the Peach Orchard, which was then clear of the enemy. His
                           movement was such as to strike the stony hill on the left and thus turn the flank of the troops that had driven us from that
                           position. On his approach the enemy retreated across the wheat-field, where, with the regiments of my left wing, Wofford attacked
                           with great effect, driving the Federals upon and near to <a href="http://thomaslegion.net/coloneljoshuachamberlain.html" target="tlx_new"><font  color="black"><FONT color=#0000ff>Little Round Top</FONT></font></a>.</FONT></P>
                           <P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif size=2>"I rallied the remainder of my brigade and a portion of Semmes's at Rose's,
                           with the assistance of Colonel (Moxley) Sorrel of Longstreet's staff, and advanced with them to the support of Wofford, taking
                           position at the stone wall overlooking the forest to the right of Rose's house. Finding that Wofford's men were coming out,
                           I retained them at that point to check any attempt of the enemy to follow. It was now near nightfall and the operations of
                           the day were over. That night we occupied the ground over which we had fought, with my left at the Peach Orchard, on the hill,
                           and gathered the dead and wounded- a long list of brave officers and men. Captain Cunningham's company of the 2<SUP>nd</SUP>

                           from Richmond and Petersburg in April 1865, Kershaw was captured along with most of his troops at Saylor's Creek, Virginia,
                           three days before the end came at </FONT><a href="http://thomaslegion.net/battleofappomattoxcourthouse.html" target="tlx_new"><font  color="black"><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif color=#0000ff size=2>Appomattox Court House</FONT></font></a><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif size=2>. Paroled that July, Kershaw returned to Camden where he remained active in politics
                           and again returned to the state legislature, this time as a senator. He later served as a judge for the Fifth Judicial Circuit
                           of South Carolina. In 1894, Kershaw resigned from the bench due to ill health and accepted an appointment as postmaster in
                           Camden, a position he held for only several weeks until his death on April 13, 1894. General Kershaw is buried in Camden.</FONT>

                           1990's, South Carolinians have been different, in almost every way, then the rest of the country. While <st1:State w:st="on">North
                           Carolina</st1:State>&#8217;s motto is 'first in flight', <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:State w:st="on">South Carolina</st1:State></st1:place>'s

                           style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"> When William Freehling's Prelude to Civil War first appeared in
                           1965 it was immediately hailed as a brilliant and incisive study of the origins of the Civil War. Book Week called it "fresh,
                           exciting, and convincing," while The Virginia Quarterly Review praised it as, quite simply, "history at its best." It was
                           equally well-received by historical societies, garnering the Allan Nevins History Prize as well as a Bancroft Prize, the most
                           prestigious history award of all. Now once again available, Prelude to Civil War is still the definitive work on the subject,
                           and one of the most important in antebellum studies.&nbsp;Continued below&#8230;</SPAN>

                           story of the Nullification Controversy in South Carolina, describing how from 1816 to 1836 aristocratic planters of the Palmetto
                           State tumbled from a contented and prosperous life of elegant balls and fine Madeira wines to a world rife with economic distress,
                           guilt over slavery, and apprehension of slave rebellion. It shows in compelling detail how this reversal of fortune led the
                           political leaders of <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" ?><st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
                           w:st="on">South Carolina</st1:place></st1:State> down the path to ever more radical states rights doctrines: in 1832 they
                           were seeking to nullify federal law by refusing to obey it; four years later some of them were considering secession. </SPAN><SPAN
                           style="FONT-FAMILY: Arial; COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">As the story unfolds, we meet a colorful and skillfully drawn cast
                           of characters, among them John C. Calhoun, who hoped that nullification would save both his highest priority, slavery, and
                           his next priority, union; President Andrew Jackson, who threatened to hang Calhoun and lead federal troops into South Carolina;
                           Denmark Vesey, who organized and nearly brought off a slave conspiracy; and Martin Van Buren, the "Little Magician," who plotted
                           craftily to replace Calhoun in Jackson's esteem. These and other important figures come to life in these pages, and help to
                           tell a tale--often in their own words--central to an understanding of the war which eventually engulfed the United States.
                           Demonstrating how a profound sensitivity to the still-shadowy slavery issue--not serious economic problems alone--led to the
                           Nullification Controversy, Freehling revises many theories previously held by historians. He describes how fear of abolitionists
                           and their lobbying power in Congress prompted <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South Carolina</st1:place></st1:State>'s
                           leaders to ban virtually any public discussion of the South's "peculiar institution," and shows that while the Civil War had
                           many beginnings, none was more significant than this single, passionate controversy. Written in a lively and eminently readable
                           style, Prelude to Civil War is must reading for anyone trying to discover the roots of the conflict that soon would tear the
                           <st1:place w:st="on">Union</st1:place> apart.</SPAN>

                           Generals in Gray was published in 1959, scholars and critics immediately hailed it as one of the few indispensable books on
                           the American Civil War. Historian Stanley Horn, for example, wrote, "It is difficult for a reviewer to restrain his enthusiasm
                           in recommending a monumental book of this high quality and value." Here at last is the paperback edition of Ezra J. Warner&#8217;s
