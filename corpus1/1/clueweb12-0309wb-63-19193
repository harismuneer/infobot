<p>1.&nbsp; The presidential election is dominated by early-year presidential 
primaries, followed by the general <b>Electoral College</b> vote in November.&nbsp; 
What effect does the contemporary presidential primary calendar have upon 
campaign strategy of major candidates from either party?&nbsp; And what is the 
effect of the Democrats' PR use compared to Republican winner-take-all in 
determination of their respective presidential nominee?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; What is the 
effect of unit voting by states on the two-party 
general election campaign?&nbsp; And what effect does the Electoral College itself have upon 
campaign strategy of the two major party candidates?&nbsp; What would change in 
national popular vote were to replace the Electoral College in the general 
election for president?</p>
<p>
3.&nbsp; Morton 14 addresses duopoly, minor and third-party candidates, and the 
coordination problem associated with reliance on plurality voting in 
single-member districts.&nbsp; How often do third party and independent candidates 
win recent American partisan elections?&nbsp; Include 2006 and 2008 results if you wish; but 2002 and 2004 for sure.&nbsp; 
For third-party and independent candidate followers, specify when 
they engage in strategic voting and when they vote sincerely.&nbsp; Finally, 
specify structural designs used by supporters of duopoly to make viable 
three-candidate contests a rare thing.</p>
<p>
4.&nbsp; Morton 11 and 15 considers the effect of congressional 
redistricting upon elections, and representation, in the current U.S. House of 
Representatives.&nbsp; First, what is the distinction of <b>gerrymandering</b> from
<b>malapportionment</b>?&nbsp; 
Considering the attribute known as &quot;responsiveness,&quot; what effect does gerrymandering have upon 
the partisan division of power in the House?&nbsp; And what effect does it have 
upon aspirations to achieve office by racial minority (black and hispanic) 
politicians?</p>
