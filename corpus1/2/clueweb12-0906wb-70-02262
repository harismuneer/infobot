<h1>
	What Is the Capital Gains Tax?</h1>
<p>Capital gains are the profits realized from the sale of capital assets, such as stocks, bonds, and property. The capital gains tax is triggered only when an asset is sold, not while the asset is held by an investor. However, mutual fund investors could be charged capital gains on investments in the fund that are sold by the fund during the year.</p><p>There are two types of capital gains: long term and short term; each has different tax rates. <strong>Long-term gains</strong> are profits on assets held longer than 12 months before they are sold. As a result of the 2003 tax law, the long-term capital gains tax was reduced from 20% to 15% (0% for individuals in the 10% and 15% tax brackets) through 2012;&nbsp;the 2010 Tax Relief Act extends the reduced tax rate through 2012.&nbsp;<strong>Short-term gains</strong> (on assets held for 12 months or less), on the other hand, are taxed as ordinary income at the seller&rsquo;s marginal income tax rate.</p><p>The taxable amount of each gain is determined by a &ldquo;cost basis&rdquo;&mdash; in other words, the original purchase price adjusted for additional improvements or investments, taxes paid on dividends, certain fees, and any depreciation of the assets. In addition, any capital losses incurred in the current tax year or previous years can be used to offset taxes on current-year capital gains. Losses of up to $3,000 a year may be claimed as a tax deduction.</p><p>If you have been purchasing shares in a mutual fund over several years and want to sell some holdings, instruct your financial professional to sell shares that you purchased for the highest amount of money, because this will reduce your capital gains. Also, be sure to specify which shares you are selling so that you can take advantage of the lower rate on long-term gains. The IRS may assume that you are selling shares you have held for a shorter time and tax you using short-term rates.</p><p>Capital gains distributions for the prior year are reported to you by January 31, and any taxes that must be paid on gains are due on the date of your tax return. The reduced rates on long-term capital gains taxes may not be around much longer if Congress doesn&rsquo;t extend the 15% reduced rate beyond 2012, so it may be wise to take advantage of the lower rates before they are scheduled to expire.</p><p class="note">The information in this article is not intended to be tax or legal advice, and it may not be relied on for the purpose of avoiding any federal tax penalties.
