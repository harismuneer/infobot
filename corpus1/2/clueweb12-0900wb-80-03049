        When is Donna Summer coming to my town?</font></B><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; All the
	    tour dates I know about are posted on the <a href="news.htm#tour">news page</a>.
	    &nbsp;If no dates are posted, then it means Donna is not touring at this
        time. If dates are listed and your town is not listed, then that means
        no appearance has been scheduled there at this time. Of course tour info can change without warning so check in
	    regularly to see if anything new has been added. As soon as I learn of
        any public appearances I will add them to the site - even if it means an
        early update.

        <p><b><font color="#FF0000">When is a new CD coming out?</font></b> Not
        soon enough!&nbsp; LOL But seriously, as soon as there is a release
        date, it will be posted in the <a href="news.htm#news">news</a> section.
        If you want to keep updated with all the info we have so far, check out

	    are looking for.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ebay.com" target="_blank">Ebay</a> is
        probably the number one place to grab rare collectibles (or downright
        weird things sometimes). And check out some of the links on my <a href="links.htm#shop">links page</a>
        for good sources of current and rare recordings. I have a number of vendors
	    listed and I add more now and then. In the interests of full disclosure,
	    I am affiliated with Amazon.com but I won't hold it against
	    you if you shop elsewhere. &nbsp;;-) &nbsp;If you are looking for
        Donna's paintings, the place to go is Donna Summer Enterprises. <a href="mailto:webmaster@donna-tribute.com">Email</a>
        me directly for contact info.

        Where can I find the words to my favorite Donna Summer
	    song?</font></B><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; Hugo has a <a href="http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Theater/3487/" target="_blank"> Donna Summer
        Lyrics</a> website that is devoted almost entirely to lyrics. In fact he has the lyrics to all
	    of Donna's songs posted - and he's broken it up by album. And more
        recently, Sandro at <a href="http://www.foreverdonna.com" target="_blank">Forever
        Donna</a> has added a lyric section that is very comprehensive. His
        section is organized by song title rather than by album. (You will NOT
        find <i>I Will Survive</i> on either site. See # 9 below.)

        When's Donna's birthday? How many Grammys has she won?&nbsp; Where
	    was she born? Is she married? Does she have kids? What did she eat for
	    breakfast?</font></B><font color="#FF0000">&nbsp;</font>&nbsp; Boy you ask a lot of questions! Check out
	    my <a HREF="bio.html">biography</a>
	    page for answers to those questions
	    and more. (Well, except for the breakfast thing..... if I shared EVERYTHING
	    it would ruin the mystique.&nbsp; LOL) Note to kids writing school
        reports: I'll be happy to direct you to good sources of information, but
        you'll have to do your own research. I already wrote my fair share of
        term papers many years ago!&nbsp; ;-)
        </p>
	  <LI>
        <p><b><font color="#FF0000">Where does Donna live?</font></b>
        In a house, silly!&nbsp; ;-) But seriously, over the years she has
        maintained homes in Los Angeles, New York, Connecticut, and Nashville.
        If you want an actual street address - you have to ask her yourself!
        </p>
	  <LI>
        <p>
	    <B><font color="#FF0000">How do you know all this stuff?</font>&nbsp;</B> You may be surprised
	    to find out I get a lot of my information from visitors like you. Granted,
	    over the years I have made a few contacts - but even so the bulk of my
	    information comes from other fans who have seen things in their local papers,
	    talked to contacts of their own, run into things on their local television
	    stations, found things while surfing the internet, etc. I really have to
	    do very little leg work myself. What I do mainly, is I take all the little
	    pieces everyone sends me and I try to put it together in some kind of coherent
	    (or sometimes incoherent) order.
        </p>
	  <LI>
        <p>
	    <B><font color="#FF0000">How can I email Donna?</font></B>&nbsp; Well, at this time Donna does
	    NOT have a public email address. I can forward messages to her people
        for you, but I CANNOT guarantee a personal reply. If Donna personally
        answered all her fan mail, she'd have no time to do anything
        else!&nbsp;&nbsp;
        </p>
	  <LI>
        <p><B><font color="#FF0000">Where is Donna's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame
        located?</font>
	    </B>You will find it at 7000 Hollywood Blvd by the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel.
	    It's in front of the parking structure on the side of the building facing
	    Hollywood Blvd. I've never been there myself, but I understand that's not
	    necessarily the nicest part of Los Angeles - so check it out in the
	    daytime.
        </p>
	  <LI>
        <p>
	    <B><font color="#FF0000">I've looked ALL OVER your site and I can't find one mention of my favorite
	    Donna Summer song,<i> I Will Survive</i>. What gives?<I>&nbsp;</I></font></B> Well, it is
	    a good song - unfortunately it's not a Donna song. It was recorded by Gloria
	    Gaynor, but don't feel bad - many, many people have made the same mistake.
	    (Why else would I mention it here?) For more information on <i>I Will
        Survive</i>, try Gloria's official website at: <a href="http://www.gloriagaynor.com" target="_blank">www.gloriagaynor.com</a>.</p>
	  <LI>
        <p><b><font color="#FF0000">Just how often do you update
        around here?&nbsp; </font></b>I try to update the news about once a week
        (usually on the weekend), but sometimes that varies due to my personal
        commitments or due to the availability of news. (When something
        important happens I have been known to update early, or more than once a
        week.) The Summer Fever page is changed as close to the first of each
        month as possible. Other pages are updated only as needed - significant
        updates will be mentioned in the site news section of the news page.</p>
	  <LI>
        <p><b><font color="#FF0000">Where can I buy Donna's
        artwork?</font></b> You need to contact Donna Summer Enterprises out in
        LA. The address, phone, and email address are available upon request -
        just email the <a href="mailto:webmaster@donna-tribute.com">webmaster</a> for
        info.</p>
	  <LI>
        <p><b><font color="#FF0000">I have a Donna Summer painting and I want to
        know what it's worth.</font></b> Unfortunately, I am not qualified to
        appraise anything. (But I am qualified to stand in front of your
        painting and say &quot;Wow, I bet that's worth big bucks!&quot; LOL) If
        you need the value for insurance purposes, then you need to find an
        appraiser that your insurance company will recognize. If you are looking
        to sell your painting, then I suggest putting it up for auction.</p>
	  <LI>
        <p><font color="#FF0000"><b>Every once in awhile you mention &quot;the
        vault&quot;. What is that?</b></font> You'll see &quot;the vault&quot;
        mentioned on the forums quite a bit. Over the years Donna has recorded
        plenty of songs that never made it on to an album for whatever reason.
        There are demos that never made it past the demo stage, songs that just
        didn't fit the theme of the album they were meant for, songs the record
        company didn't like, you name it. We refer to those unreleased tracks as
        being &quot;in the vault.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
	  <LI>
        <p><b><font color="#FF0000">I clicked on a Donna Summer link someplace
        that took me to a site with lots of profanity and weird stuff. It sort
        of freaked me out. What's up with that?</font></b> I'm glad you asked.
        Believe it or not, there are two Donna Summers. The one we all know and
        love (of course) and some musician/DJ guy who does some kind of strange
        hard rock thing. If you ran into weird things that don't fit our Donna's
        image, then you probably found that other guy. (And yes, he really is a
        GUY using the name Donna Summer.) If you ran into a site that is
        associated with cockrockdisco.com, then you found that other guy. And if
        you found a lot of profanity, then you found me after a computer crash
        ate my updates!&nbsp;&nbsp; ;-)</p>

      <TD><H2>
	  Abbreviations commonly used on this site and the forum:</H2>
	<p>
	LOL = laughing out loud <BR>
	ROTFL = rolling on the floor laughing <BR>
	IMHO =&nbsp; in my humble opinion <BR>
	:-)&nbsp; = smile <BR>
	;-)&nbsp; = wink <BR>
	:-(&nbsp; = frown <BR>
	:-&THORN;&nbsp; = sticking tongue out
        </p>
	<p>
	Additionally, on occasion you may find song titles or album titles abbreviated.
	(This happens more on the online forums than it does on this site.) Generally
	speaking titles are shortened to just the first letters of each word in the
	title. So <I>I Will Go With You</I> becomes IWGWY. <I><b>Live &amp; More
	Encore</b></I> becomes LME, L&amp;ME or even LAME, <I><b>Ordinary Girl</b> </I>becomes
	OG, etc. If you ever run into an abbreviation somewhere that you don't
	understand, just ASK. Most people are happy to explain.</p>
