  <dt><span style="layout-grid-mode:line">Test Engineering Code 246 personnel
    are testing radar systems on the USS CARL VINSON (CVN 70). Radar systems
    emit Radio Frequency (RF) radiation, which is known to affect sensitive
    electronic equipment. Workers have noticed the effect of this testing on
    pagers, computer systems, security systems and radios. This has raised a
    concern from some employees that they may be harmed by the current testing.
    This Alert is to assure workers that there is no risk to their health by the
    current testing.</span></dt>

  <dt><span style="layout-grid-mode:line">The large rectangular antenna
    (AN/SPS-48E) forward of the mast is the antenna affecting some electronic
    components. It is only radiating when it is rotating, but at times it is
    rotating without radiating from the antenna.</span></dt>

    These RF exposures do not exceed the permissible exposure limit (PEL)
    established by DOD INST 6055.11 for the protection of personnel at any
    accessible location. These limits are conservatively set and are safe for
