      Middlesex
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      "In 1889 the Administrative County of London was formed from the City of
      London, and parts of Middlesex, Kent and Surrey and was divided into
      boroughs. In 1963 this County was replaced by Greater London which also
      took in the rest of Middlesex and parts of Essex and Herts as well as
      some county boroughs. New London boroughs were then formed." [T.V.H.
      FitzHugh, The Dictionary of Genealogy, 1994.]
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      There is thus a considerable overlap in the coverage of London and in
      particular Middlesex on this server. And even this complicated
      description doesn't give the full story, as parts of Middlesex went to
      Surrey and Hertfordshire. However, following the practice
      adopted in the LDS Family History Library, information related to London
      parishes other than those belonging to the City of London will be
      provided here, or with Kent, Surrey, etc., as appropriate, rather than in
      the <a href="http://homepages.gold.ac.uk/genuki/LND/index.html">London
      pages</a>.

      <li>Description from Barclay's Complete and Universal English Dictionary,
      1842.)"A county of England, bounded by Hertfordshire, Essex, Surrey,
      Kent, and Buckinghamshire. It is one of the least counties in England,
      being only about 22 miles in length, and 14 in breadth. It contains 7
      market towns, and about 98 parishes, without including those in London
      and Westminster. The air is healthy; but the soil in general being a lean
      gravel, it is naturally a district of little fertility, though by means
      of the vicinity to the metropolis, many parts of it are converted into
      rich beds of manure, clothed with almost perpetual verdure. Besides the
      Thames, the Lea, and the Coln, Middlesex is watered by several small
      streams, one of which, called the New River, is artificially brought from
      Amwell, in Hertfordshire, for the purpose of supplying London with water.
      Indeed, the whole county may be considered as a demesne to the
      metropolis, the land being laid out in gardens, pastures, and enclosures
      of all sorts, for its convenience and support. London is its chief place,
      and county town. Population, 1,576,636."
