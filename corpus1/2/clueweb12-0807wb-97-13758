In the last section of that book with the most beautiful of
titles, <i>Per Amica Silentia Lun&aelig;</i>, Yeats, addressing Iseult
Gonne, refers to those moments when he becomes happy&#8212;when
poetry overbrims on the page, and things turn luminous, and
time seems to &#8220;burn up&#8221; in the sense of no longer mattering,
no longer having the power to detract or diminish.
</p>

<p>
He is writing about lyric poetry, of course, and about those
special moments that may come upon us at any age or at any
time, but which become more recognizable to the poet as he
or she grows older, and more experienced and knowledgeable&#8212;although
they are also becoming, in actuarial terms, more rare.

<p>
But perhaps not.  Perhaps, with wisdom and insight and
acceptance, they actually increase in frequency.  Recently I
told an old friend, a visitor to my home, that after all
these years I have finally begun to understand how to write
poems.  Put simply, I have gotten better at being patient,
and at waiting until they appear.  I have learned the
necessity of silencing my own thoughts in order to hear the
brushing of their wings as they pass overhead.
</p>

<p>
Or, to change the metaphor&#8212;only when the wind dies down
can the bee or the butterfly land on the blossom.  Genuine
lyricism comes only after the self has been quieted.  Not
put to sleep, or&#8212;least of all&#8212;&#8221;put on hold,&#8221; in that
ugly, modern phrase.  Rather, shifted into another
dimension.  Allowed to drift, and to become something rich
and strange.
</p>

<p>
Could this be considered an escape from individual
consciousness&#8212;or a surrender to something greater than the
self?   Quite possibly.  &#8220;Poetry is not a turning loose of
emotion, but an escape from emotion,&#8221; as T. S. Eliot has
pointed out.   &#8220;It is not the expression of personality, but
an escape from personality.  But, of course, only those who
have personality and emotions know what it means to want to
escape from these things.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
&#8220;It may be an hour before the mood passes,&#8221; Yeats continues,
in a completely disarming, unexpected passage in his letter
to Miss Gonne, &#8220;but latterly I seem to understand that I
enter upon it the moment I cease to hate.&#8221;  He goes on to
say, &#8220;I think the common condition of our life is hatred&#8212;I
know that this is so with me&#8212;irritation with public or
private events or persons.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
He attempts to define what he means by not hating, and it is
not necessarily loving.  Rather, &#8220;in those brief intense
visions of sleep, I have something about me that, though it
makes me love, is more like innocence.  I am in the place
where the Daimon is, but I do not think he is with me until
I begin to make a new personality.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
This new personality is a paradox.  Recognizably human&#8212;fragile,
perishable, transient&#8212;it lacks the negative
aspects of selfhood.  It is incapable of being egocentric or
greedy or mean-spirited.  It has accepted its present state
of being and its eventual death and dissolution.
</p>

<p>
We are speaking, then, of neither comedy or tragedy, nor
their dramatic manifestations in verse, but of the <i>lyric
temper</i> in poetry, and of the manner in which the poem is its
abode&#8212;just as the moth or butterfly, as it seeks to gather
up the pollen, finds its momentary resting place in the
flower.  But there is a dark side to this metaphor, and in
any such discussion it cannot be avoided.  Even the purest
lyric voice is, by its very nature, transitory and
perishable.
</p>

<p>
Honeybees, too, gather up pollen, but these are worker bees,
who venture far from the hive, and who overcome all manner
of risk in doing so.  Within the hive itself, the drones
partake of the bounty, but they do nothing to earn their
keep.  Only one of them will bed the queen.  The others,
whether they know it or not, are doomed.  By autumn, as part
of the very nature of things, the workers, understanding
that only a finite amount of food is available to see them
through the winter, push the drones out of the hive, where
they perish amid the thorns and brambles.
</p>

<p>
Many is the lyric poet who, having dined the summer long on
the ambrosia of the imagination, will eventually be forced
by sheer circumstance to drop away from the hive.  Sappho&#8217;s
main works are lost; Keats&#8217;s productive years were pitiably
few, as were those of Chatterton and Rimbaud.  Madness
overtook Smart, H&ouml;lderlin, Clare, and dozens more.  We know
this, and thus each lyric poem we have managed to preserve
from past centuries speaks to us in an especially poignant
way.  However lovely, however evocative, we know it will not
last.
</p>

<p>
Santayana has summed up the situation:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Even the most inspired verse, which boasts not without a
relative justification to be immortal, becomes in the course
of ages a scarcely legible hieroglyphic; the language it was
written in dies, a learned education and an imaginative
effort are requisite to catch even a vestige of its original
force.  Nothing is so irrevocable as mind.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
This is why lyric poetry retains its power to speak to us,
down through the ages: because it is perishing before our
very eyes, even as our eyes are perishing too.  And yet it
does not matter.  &#8220;I am in the  place,&#8221; Yeats maintains,
&#8220;where the Daimon is.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
And what might that be&#8212;the presence of &#8220;the Daimon&#8221;?
Such a term can mystify, but surely this refers to some
fundamental antinomy of human existence, some intuition of
paradox that lies at the heart of conscious being.  Keats
called it &#8220;negative capability&#8221;; Scott Fitzgerald praised
&#8220;that ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the
same time, and still retain the ability to function.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
The two ideas?  Life and eternity.  Death and transcendence.
Light and darkness.  Perhaps another poet, Arlington
Robinson, best described the paradox, in his tribute to
Whitman: &#8220;When we write / Men&#8217;s letters on proud marble or
on sand, /  We write them there forever.&#8221;
</p>

<p>
To be with the Daimon, to participate in timeless awareness,
is why we write lyric poems, and why we return to them&#8212;and
why we revere the great periods of lyric achievement.
Undoubtedly there have been many, in different cultures
around the world, but we have managed to preserve only a
few.  We treasure the lyric writings of the Sufis and of the
Elizabethans.  We hark back to the time of Wordsworth and
H&ouml;lderlin, to the T&#8217;ang Dynasty, and to that amazing stretch
from Baudelaire to Mallarm&eacute; in the second half of the
nineteenth century, an interval that included Tennyson,
Dickinson, Heine, Verlaine, Whitman, Hopkins, Hardy, Rilke,
and Yeats himself.
</p>

<p>
Eventually all of these will be wiped clean and forgotten,
which is why they now seem so lovely.  They are that which
has managed to survive and come down to us in spite of
everything.  Wang Wei knew this.  As the glories of the
T&#8217;ang began to crumble and fall away, he paid tribute to
that bittersweet awareness that we have come to know as the
lyric temper:
</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
Be not disquieted either by kindness or by insult&#8212;
  empty joy or sorrow.
Do not count on good or evil&#8212;you will only
  waste your time . . .
And why seek advice from the Yellow Emperor
  or Confucius?
Who knows but that we all live out our lives
  in the maze of a dream?
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
&#8220;Per amica silentia lun&aelig;&#8221; is a line from the <i>Aeneid</i>.
Yeats translates it as  &#8220;Through the friendly silences of
the moon.&#8221;   It is a most pregnant line.  The moon never
speaks; its very essence is change.  And yet each of us
considers it a constant friend, and we invariably greet it
with our innermost being, each time we see it up there alone
in the night sky.  We have carried on this friendship since
childhood.  Lyric poetry deals with such verities.
</p>

<p>
The following is by Witter Bynner, taken from his masterful
introduction to <i>The Jade Mountain: A Chinese Anthology</i>:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
. . . if we will be honest with ourselves and with our
appreciation of what is lastingly important, we shall find
these very same poems to be momentous details in the immense
patience of beauty.  They are the heart of an intimate
letter.  They bring the true, the beautiful, the
everlasting, into simple, easy touch with the human, the
homely, and the immediate.
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
A key phrase in this passage is worth repeating and
remembering: &#8220;The immense patience of beauty.&#8221;  Surely it is
to this that the poet must surrender if the lyric temper is
to be made manifest.
