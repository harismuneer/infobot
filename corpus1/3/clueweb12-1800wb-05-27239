	<meta name="Description" content="The life of Gloria Gaynor has hit some amazing peaks, and some difficult valleys. But it is a life story that is still being written.Gloria today is as active as ever - performing live concerts, appearing on national TV, releasing new CDs - and she's more positive than ever. Whatever Gloria sets out to do, you can be sure it will reflect the same deep spirit and transformative ability as the music and life within her. She is still very much a survivor.She was 19 when she signed her first record contract. In 1973, Gloria made history as Billboard gave birth to the Disco Action Charts. Never Can Say Good-Bye bowed at #1 on the charts and became the first Dance Song to reach #1 status in dance music. Ever since that time, for more than 30 years, Gloria keeps setting the standard. In March of 2001, her single, Just Keep Thinkin&rsquo; About You, topped the Billboard Dance/Club charts at #1, while her international hit Last Night with Giorgio Moroder debuted at #1 throughout Europe. In keeping with the theme of #1, Gloria Gaynor was the first to record an album especially for clubs, and the first to do a mega-extended dance medley party mix, releasing 12 dance singles that are now high-end collectors items.In September 2002, Logic Records/BMG released the highly anticipated U.S. LP entitled I Wish You Love. That was her first worldwide release in 15 years. It gave birth to 4 #1 dance singles on Billboards Dance Charts as well as her first top ten, I Never Knew, on Billboard's Adult Contemporary Charts. She also recorded a new version of I Will Survive in Spanglish, recorded live in Brazil.Her popularity has continuously flourished into the new millennium. In 2002, she was honored at the World Music Awards in Monte Carlo with the coveted LEGEND award presented by long time fan Prince Albert. She made a splash on Broadway in the longest running musical revue, Smokey Joe&rsquo;s Caf&eacute;, and on national TV, as a guest star on such popular programs as That &lsquo;70&rsquo;s Show , Ally McBeal and more, introducing her to a whole new generation of fans.The film industry continues to feature I Will Survive, on the soundtrack of more than a half dozen major motion picture releases. VH-1 honored Gloria Gaynor with the number one spot during their countdown of the Top 100 Dance Records of All Time for I Will Survive.On September 19, 2005 Gloria, along with her Hit song I Will Survive were inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame during a ceremony that took place in New York City.Gloria even found time to write an autobiography entitled, I Will Survive (St. Martin&rsquo;s Press) that is a revealing trip through her journey in life. She also lends her support to numerous charities, ranging from the likes of The Rita Hayworth Gala for Alzheimer&rsquo;s to Revlon&rsquo;s Annual Walk for Life." />

				<h3 class="imprimible">Description</h3>
				
		<p>The life of Gloria Gaynor has hit some amazing peaks, and some difficult valleys. But it is a life story that is still being written.</p>
<p>Gloria today is as active as ever - performing live concerts, appearing on national TV, releasing new CDs - and she's more positive than ever. Whatever Gloria sets out to do, you can be sure it will reflect the same deep spirit and transformative ability as the music and life within her. <br />She is still very much a survivor.</p>
<p>She was 19 when she signed her first record contract. In 1973, Gloria made history as Billboard gave birth to the Disco Action Charts. "Never Can Say Good-Bye" bowed at #1 on the charts and became the first Dance Song to reach #1 status in dance music. Ever since that time, for more than 30 years, Gloria keeps setting the standard. In March of 2001, her single, "Just Keep Thinkin&rsquo; About You," topped the Billboard Dance/Club charts at #1, while her international hit "Last Night" with Giorgio Moroder debuted at #1 throughout Europe. In keeping with the theme of #1, Gloria Gaynor was the first to record an album especially for clubs, and the first to do a mega-extended dance medley party mix, releasing 12" dance singles that are now high-end collectors items.</p>
<p>In September 2002, Logic Records/BMG released the highly anticipated U.S. LP entitled "I Wish You Love." That was her first worldwide release in 15 years. It gave birth to 4 #1 dance singles on Billboards Dance Charts as well as her first top ten, "I Never Knew", on Billboard's Adult Contemporary Charts. She also recorded a new version of "I Will Survive" in Spanglish, recorded live in Brazil.</p>
<p>Her popularity has continuously flourished into the new millennium. In 2002, she was honored at the World Music Awards in Monte Carlo with the coveted LEGEND award presented by long time fan Prince Albert. She made a splash on Broadway in the longest running musical revue, "Smokey Joe&rsquo;s Caf&eacute;", and on national TV, as a guest star on such popular programs as "That &lsquo;70&rsquo;s Show" , "Ally McBeal" and more, introducing her to a whole new generation of fans.</p>
<p>The film industry continues to feature "I Will Survive," on the soundtrack of more than a half dozen major motion picture releases. VH-1 honored Gloria Gaynor with the number one spot during their countdown of the Top 100 Dance Records of All Time for "I Will Survive".</p>
<p>On September 19, 2005 Gloria, along with her Hit song "I Will Survive" were inducted into the Dance Music Hall of Fame during a ceremony that took place in New York City.</p>
<p>Gloria even found time to write an autobiography entitled, "I Will Survive" (St. Martin&rsquo;s Press) that is a revealing trip through her journey in life. <br />She also lends her support to numerous charities, ranging from the likes of The Rita Hayworth Gala for Alzheimer&rsquo;s to Revlon&rsquo;s Annual Walk for Life.</p>	</div>
