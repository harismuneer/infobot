        An edited version of the below article was published in the November 2008 
        edition of Fidelity's Active Trader E-news (as it was for 2007). See lot's 
        of other articles in prior years below this article and they are still 
        helpful this year. </em><br>
        <br>
        Read our <a href="http://www.greencompany.com/blog/index.php">blog</a> 
        for Green's articles on expected tax law changes coming in 2009 from our 
        new President-elect Obama together with a Democratic-controlled Congress. 
        Plus, about how the IRS is getting tougher on trader tax status and MTM 
        ordinary loss treatment. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If Obama and Congress agree on tax rate increases on upper-income 
          taxpayers for 2009 and later years, it may be a wise 2008 year-end tax 
          strategy to take more income into 2008, instead of 2009. Securities 
          traders can sell short-term, and long-term profitable positions in 2008 
          (for a 15 percent long-term gains tax rate, versus a 20 percent rate 
          maybe coming in 2009). Plus, give themselves a better chance to qualify 
          for middle-class tax benefits coming in 2009. <br>
        </li>
        <li>Try not to trigger AMT tax in 2008, because if AMT is repealed in 
          2009, you will lose a chance to get back an AMT credit (your AMT taxes 
          back). If your income is high enough, you usually fall out of the AMT 
          zone; since so much income is taxed at 35 percent versus the AMT rate 
          of 28 percent. <br>
        </li>
        <li>If you are a &quot;close call&quot; on trader tax status in 2008, 
          and are counting on that business status to file for a large tax refund 
          in 2008 - and possibly in the past two years too with a NOL carryback 
          return - consider a change of course. <br>
          <br>
          For example, you can soak up your 2008 ordinary trading losses (from 
          IRC 475 MTM on securities, or IRC 988 on forex) by converting from a 
          traditional retirement plan to a Roth IRA. Rather than ask the IRS for 
          a large tax refund, which can trigger an exam in this difficult environment, 
          wind up being a small taxpayer for 2008. You can then trade your Roth 
          IRA aggressively for permanent tax savings. <br>
          <br>
          Alternatively, plan to carry forward your NOL rather than carry it back. 
          Fulltime traders with a strong case for trader tax status and use of 
          ordinary loss treatment should file for their NOL carryback refunds 
          and hopefully all states will honor them.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Futures traders should think twice about joining a futures or options 
          exchange, because their trading gains are subject to self-employment 
          taxes (social security and Medicare) per Section 1402i. Obama campaigned 
          on resubjecting earned incomes over $250,000 to 12.4 percent social 
          security tax. The Medicare 2.9 percent tax already applies to all earned 
          income without limits. We believe that Electronic Corporate Memberships 
          on the CME are not full fledged memberships and they don't trigger the 
          SE tax. <br>
          <br>
        </li>
        <li>Republicans proposed raising the capital loss limitation to $20,000 
          from the paltry $3,000 limit used for almost half a century; and it's 
          never been indexed for inflation. Hopefully, Democrats will consider 
          this tax change too, as it will help the entire investor-class.</li>

        As pointed out above and below, some upper-income taxpayers may want to 
        reverse normal year-end tax strategies; with a goal of accelerating income, 
        deferring deductions and avoiding AMT more than ever before. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Update of annual year-end tax planning article geared to traders:</strong><br>
        <br>
        Year-end tax planning can be more challenging for traders than other taxpayers. 
        Traders have widely fluctuating incomes and there are complex rules for 
        wash sales, capital-loss restrictions, trader tax status and more. Plus, 
        this year there are several proposed tax changes to consider, particularly 
        the potential repeal of the Alternative Minimum Tax.</p>
      <p>By Robert A. Green, CPA<br>
        <br>
        Most year-end tax planning articles in the mainstream media focus on tried-and-true 
        strategies &#8211; what I call &#8220;plain vanilla.&#8221;<br>
        <br>
        This writer&#8217;s Web site also features plain vanilla year-end tax 
        planning at <a href="http://www.greencompany.com/Tools/Newsletters.shtml">http://www.greencompany.com/Tools/Newsletters.shtml</a> 
        (November, 2007 issue). An update of this article with appear in Fidelity's 
        same newsletter for November 2008, along with another article from Green 
        on Tips for Dealing with the IRS.<br>
        <br>
        However, active traders should also focus on tax planning opportunities 
        unique to their industry; this is especially true of traders rising to 
        the level of business tax status.<br>
        <br>
        Plain vanilla year-end tax planning strategies suggest that all taxpayers, 
        including active traders, should generally defer income and accelerate 
        expenses in order to reduce current-year taxable income and tax liabilities. 
        <br>
        <br>
        But the AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax) is becoming an increasingly big 
        problem, turning most tax planning logic upside-down. AMT is a huge concern 
        for 2008, since it is snagging more taxpayers this year and may be repealed 
        in 2009. Taxpayers should therefore make AMT planning job No. 1 in their 
        year-end tax planning. <br>
        <br>
        Plain vanilla doesn&#8217;t cut it for active traders. Active traders 
        need better and more customized tax planning suggestions. <br>
        <br>
        Here are a few nifty 2008 year-end tax planning tips for active traders. 
        First, though, a little more perspective on AMT.</p>
      <p><strong>AMT planning should dictate overall tax planning</strong><br>
        If the Democratic-controlled Congress succeeds in repealing the AMT tax 
        (in 2009), most taxpayers should avoid paying any AMT taxes in 2008. Congress 
        is also proposing to raise tax rates on upper-income taxpayers by increasing 
        their top marginal tax rate to 44 percent from 35 percent. Paying for 
        AMT relief is the excuse for the tax hike. <br>
        <br>
        See our blog for current articles on Obama's tax initiatives and the Democratic 
        tax initiatives in 2008 tax bills (not passed), like HR 3970 (<a href="http://www.greencompany.com/blog/index.php?postid=6">Jan. 
        2008 blog article</a>)<br>
        <br>
        By accelerating income into 2008 and deferring AMT tax deductions into 
        2009, a taxpayer can save taxes in two ways. First, they can reduce AMT 
        taxes for 2008 (hopefully permanently), and second, they can subject more 
        income to 35-percent tax rates in 2008 rather than (possibly) 44-percent 
        tax rates in 2009.<br>
        <br>
        For &#8220;married filing joint&#8221; incomes under $200,000, the regular 
        tax rates are 28 percent, which matches the AMT tax rate. <br>
        <br>
        That means these taxpayers will surely trigger AMT and be disenfranchised 
        on many of their itemized deductions (state taxes, investment interest 
        and expenses, miscellaneous deductions, portion of municipal bond interest 
        and much more). <br>
        <br>
        Futures and (electing) forex traders also trigger AMT way too easily. 
        With 60/40 tax treatment on IRC 1256 contracts (60 percent of profits 
        are taxed at the lower, long-term tax rate and 40 percent at the short-term 
        rate, regardless of how long the position has been held), their maximum 
        tax rate is 23 percent &#8211; far below the AMT rate. </p>
      <p><strong>Traders have unique opportunities and pitfalls</strong><br>
        Again, the mainstream financial media often publicizes plain strategies 
        for investors. However, business traders should sometimes follow the reverse 
        strategies.<br>
        <br>
        For the past decade or more, it&#8217;s generally not been possible to 
        initiate offsetting positions to defer capital gains on one leg of a position 
        and take capital losses before year-end on the other leg. <br>
        <br>
        In the 1980s, Congress enacted IRC 1256 mark-to-market accounting for 
        futures traders in order to prevent the above types of deferral abuse. 
        Congress and the IRS have also prevented this type of deferral abuse for 
        securities traders by enacting special rules for wash-sale loss deferrals, 
        straddle losses, constructive receipts, and selling positions against 
        the box. <br>
        <br>
        Qualifying securities business traders often elect IRC 475 mark-to-market 
        (MTM) accounting (for ordinary loss treatment rather than restricted capital 
        losses), and this requires imputed sales for all open positions at year-end. 
        <br>
        <br>
        With MTM, a trader does not have to sell open positions for tax-loss selling 
        at year-end. Rather, they can simply mark their open positions to market 
        prices at year end.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Are wash sales always bad?</strong><br>
        Wash-sale loss deferrals are generally a bad thing, since they increase 
        your capital gains income in the current year. Sometimes, though, wash 
        sales can be a good thing. <br>
        <br>
        If a trader already has exceeded the $3,000 capital-loss limitation, it&#8217;s 
        better to have wash sales rather than excess capital-loss carryovers.<br>
        <br>
        The qualifying business trader will probably want to elect IRC 475 MTM 
        in the following tax year, and their wash sales are converted to ordinary 
        tax losses in that following year. They are part of the IRC 481(a) adjustment, 
        which also includes year-end unrealized gains and losses (which are also 
        preferable to carryover realized capital losses). <br>
        <br>
        Conversely, capital-loss carryovers can never be converted into ordinary 
        losses. A large capital-loss carryover may dissuade a trader from electing 
        IRC 475 MTM, since capital-loss carryovers can&#8217;t be applied against 
        MTM ordinary trading gains. </p>
      <p><strong>Business &#8220;trader tax status&#8221; unlocks significant 
        savings</strong><br>
        With trader tax status and MTM, a trader can unlock all sorts of tax breaks, 
        including business expenses, ordinary trading losses, NOL carry-back refunds, 
        and retirement-plan and health-insurance (AGI) deductions. <br>
        <br>
        IRC 475 MTM exempts traders from the onerous wash-sale rules and capital-loss 
        limitations. <br>
        Trader tax status converts restricted investment interest and expenses 
        (not deductible for AMT) into unrestricted business expenses (all deductible 
        for AMT). <br>
        <br>
        If an active trader doesn&#8217;t qualify for trader tax status in 2008, 
        but expects to in 2009, they should consider deferring trading expenses 
        until 2009. <br>
        <br>
        It's important to note that the IRS is beefing up it's attacks on business 
        traders, so it's wise to be more conservative on trader tax status qualification 
        determinations. Read our <a href="http://www.greencompany.com/blog/index.php?postid=7">blog 
        article</a> &quot;IRS denies trader tax status and MTM.&quot; <br>
        <br>
        A conservative strategy may be to capitalize 2008&#8220;startup&#8221; 
        expenses (IRC 195) and amortize those costs when they achieve trader tax 
        status in 2009. The first $5,000 of startup costs may be expensed in the 
        first business year, with the balance amortized on a straight-line basis 
        over 15 years.</p>
      <p><strong>Retirement plans</strong><br>
        Taxpayers need to establish a mini 401(k) plan (also called an individual 
        or solo 401[k]) or defined-benefit (DB) plan before year-end; otherwise 
        it&#8217;s too late to benefit. Full funding can wait until the extended 
        tax return due date. Roth IRAs and Mini Roth IRAs are also attractive 
        plans for traders. <br>
        <br>
        Leading brokers (such as Fidelity) offer excellent retirement plan packages. 
        Mini 401(k) plans are among the best retirement plan types for traders. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Taxpayers can contribute the elective deferral maximum ($15,500 for 2008), 
        plus there is a 20-percent net profit-sharing plan included, too (for 
        a maximum contribution of $46,000). For taxpayers age 50 or older, there 
        is another $5,000 amount allowed under a &quot;catch up&quot; provision. 
        <br>
        <br>
        With a mini 401(k) plan, a taxpayer can enjoy maximum income tax savings 
        in exchange for self-employment (SE) tax costs. Structured in the right 
        manner, the active trader usually saves more in income taxes than they 
        pay in SE taxes. <br>
        <br>
        A mini 401(k) plan requires an annual 5500 or 5500-EZ filing.<br>
        <br>
        With a DB plan, higher income traders can contribute much higher amounts 
        than the limit on defined contribution or profit-sharing plans (including 
        the Mini 401[k] plan).<br>
        <br>
        Note that trading gains are not earned income, unless a trader is a member 
        of an options or futures exchange. So, non-exchange traders often need 
        to form entities to create (financially engineer) earned income for retirement-plan 
        deductions, unless they have another source of earned income.<br>
        <br>
        See 2008 contribution limits for various types of retirement plans on 
        our tools' <a href="http://www.greencompany.com/Tools/TaxCenterTaxRates.shtml">tax 
        rates page</a>, towards the bottom of the page.<br>
        <br>
        Consult us on these strategies. </p>
      <p><strong>A Roth IRA conversion may be a good strategy </strong><br>
        Because traders have fluctuating income from year-to-year, they may fall 
        under the Roth IRA income threshold in 2008 ($100,000 specially calculated 
        AGI limit). That can be a good time to do a Roth IRA conversion.<br>
        <br>
        Pay taxes at 2008 tax rates on the conversion amounts, before tax rates 
        possibly go up in 2009 (for the two most upper-income marginal tax brackets), 
        and then trade the account (permanently) tax-free through retirement. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Permanently tax free means a taxpayer can take distributions in retirement 
        tax-free, too.<br>
        <br>
        If you exceed the income thresholds, build up a regular retirement plan 
        and consider a special break currently on the books for 2010 only. The 
        Bush Tax Cuts relaxed the income threshold for all taxpayers in 2010 only 
        in connection with Roth IRA conversions. </p>
      <p><strong>Try to qualify for &#8220;middle-class tax breaks&#8221;</strong><br>
        Almost every middle-class tax break including deductions and credits (such 
        as retirement, education, and child care) have preset phase ins-and phase-outs 
        based on varying levels of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). <br>
        <br>
        Democrats plan even more tax breaks for the middle class along these lines 
        for 2009; see the Obama middle-class tax benefits mentioned on our blog 
        and his own Web site. <br>
        <br>
        Active traders can qualify for these breaks in some years and not in other 
        years (when they make their bigger gains). Only good tax planning and 
        preparation software can figure it all out in your favor and on time before 
        year-end. <br>
        <br>
        Our progressive tax code was historically based on progressive income 
        tax rates (graduated marginal tax rates), and now tax writers are using 
        complex specialized income formulas to control access to other tax breaks, 
        too. <br>
      </p>
      <p><strong>Bottom line</strong><br>
        Prepare a proforma year-end tax return using 2008 tax software. If you 
        trigger AMT, try to figure a way to prevent it. Assess your trader tax 
        status and capital gains and losses year-to-date along with all unrealized 
        gains and losses on open positions. Develop the right strategy to reduce 
        capital gains and maximize the $3,000 capital-loss limitation, but don&#8217;t 
        exceed that limitation if possible. Develop the right tax strategy for 
        2009 to complement your 2008 tax planning and save even more in 2009. 
        It&#8217;s probably best to engage a trader tax expert for more help.

      <strong>Year-End 2006:</strong> <em>( The 2007 year end article was modified 
      for 2008 above) </em> 
      <p>&quot;Year-end tax planning may 
        be important for all taxpayers, but it's paramount for traders. Jobs with 
        steady income lead to steady tax planning, as only a few tax strategies 
        may apply each year. However, trading for a living is anything but steady, 
        and valuable tax planning is almost impossible to achieve without &#8220;crunching 
        the numbers&#8221; before year-end to evaluate every available tax break 
        and pitfall.&quot; Read this <a href="#yearendtaxplanning2005"> article</a> 
        by Robert A. Green, CPA, on year-end tax planning for traders. It was 
        written for the 2005 year-end, but it still applies for the 2006 year-end, 
        as the tax code is basically the same this year-end.<br>
        <br>
        The tax code is generally indexed for inflation and threshold amounts 
        change each tax year. For a full run down on all the changes for the 2006

        </strong>Retirement plan strategies:<br>
        Establish a mini 401(k) plan or defined benefit (DB) plan before year-end; 
        otherwise it&#8217;s too late to benefit. You just need to form the plan 
        with a few dollars and you can do the contribution up until the due date 
        of your tax return including the extension. <br>
        <br>
        Mini 401k plans are among the best retirement plan types for traders. 
        For lower contribution amounts, nothing beats a mini 401(k) plan. You 
        can contribute the elective deferral maximum ($15,000 for 2006). Enjoy 
        maximum income tax savings for very low self-employment (SE) tax cost 
        with a net savings of thousands of dollars.<br>
        <br>
        With a DB plan, higher income traders can contribute much higher amounts 
        than the limit on defined contribution or profit sharing plans (including 
        the Mini 401(k) plan).<br>

        One important year-end tax strategy is to pay 100% of your state income 
        taxes owed by December 31st, rather than Q4 estimated tax due date of 
        January 15th of the following year. If you satisfy the &quot;safe harbor&quot; 
        exception on estimated taxes, you can defer the balance of your taxes 
        owed until April 15th. <br>
        <br>
        But watch out for the nasty AMT tax - that second tax regime that is catching 
        many middle class taxpayers this year. State income taxes are an AMT tax 
        preference; meaning they are not deductible for AMT. For clients who ask 
        for our help, we plan this all correctly before year-end.</p>

        tax planning may be important for all taxpayers, but it's paramount for 
        traders. Jobs with a steady income can count on steady tax planning, as 
        only a few tax strategies may apply each year. However, trading for a

        <b>An article by Robert A. Green, CPA<br>
        </b><em>(Written for Active Trader magazine in 2005<strong>.</strong> 
        The tax code is generally indexed for inflation and threshold amounts 
        change each tax year. For a full run down on all the changes for the 2006 
        and 2007 tax years, <a href="#yearend2006">click here</a> for a Client

        </b><br>
        U.S. and state income tax codes are much too complicated. For almost 100 
        years, dueling politicians have used a weapon of fiscal (tax) policy to 
        reward their constituents, encourage or discourage certain behaviors (tax 
        incentives and penalties), and spread the wealth (progressive rates and 
        now many formulas, too). </p>
      <p>Many in Congress and the White House are pushing for significant tax 
        reform. For our take on tax reform, visit our <a href="http://www.greencompany.com/Traders/Advocacy.shtml">GTT 
        Alliance for Traders and Tax Reform</a> section, specifically <a href="http://www.greencompany.com/Traders/AdvocacyTaxReform2005.shtml">Tax 
        Reform</a> and <a href="http://www.greencompany.com/Traders/AdvocacyFairTax.shtml">Fair 
        Tax</a>. The best laid tax plans need to be flexible, reactive, and visionary, 
        and we cover all these needs. </p>
      <p>Back in the &quot;old&quot; days (the early 1990s), before powerful, 
        easy-to-use computers, most taxpayers and professionals prepared income 
        tax returns by hand, so the tax code writers were forced to keep things 
        fairly simple (relatively speaking, compared to today). <br>
        <br>
        Now with the proliferation of computerized tax return preparation (e.g., 
        TurboTax and others), tax code makers and writers have enjoyed unlimited 
        ability to monkey around with the tax code. Call it pork barrel politics 
        on steroids. Almost every new tax break is written with all sorts of income 
        phase-outs, which only a computer could figure out. In the past decade, 
        many taxpayers used computers for preparation and consultations only. 
        Now you need computer number crunching for year-end planning too!<br>
        <br>
        Here are some examples:<br>
        <br>
        <em>AMT</em>: There are now two tax calculations that apply to many millions 
        of taxpayers. The second tax calculation is the nasty and now infamous 
        Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT). AMT was conceived for a small group of 
        millionaires who abused tax-shelter schemes, but now AMT is sneaking up 
        on many unsuspecting taxpayers. It's a real shame to be surprised by AMT 
        with your tax return bill after year-end, when you can do several things 
        to avoid AMT before year-end. You can't blame your accountant (the messenger) 
        about AMT anymore; we are trying to educate you. Congress is promising 
        to fix AMT, but it might take several more years. Yes, tax reform may 
        repeal AMT, but when you look closely, it's AMT that is the one tax scheme 
        that is surviving. After all, repealing all itemized deductions is just 
        like AMT in the first place. Learn more about AMT tax planning in <a href="YearEnd2005BNATaxManagementLibrary.pdf" target="_blank">this 
        article</a> from BNA. Our tax professionals can crunch your numbers, see 
        if you get snagged by AMT and try to figure out a way to limit the damage 
        (there are lots of options to consider).<br>
        <br>
        <em>Middle-class tax breaks:</em> As another example, almost every middle-class 
        tax break including retirement savings, education-related payments and 
        savings, child care payments and savings, and more are phased in-and-out 
        based on varying levels of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). Read the rules 
        in the BNA article above and your head will spin. Only good tax planning 
        and preparation software can figure it all out in your favor and on time 
        before year-end. Our progressive tax code was historically based on progressive 
        income tax rates (graduated marginal tax rates), and now tax writers are 
        using complex specialized income formulas to control access to other tax 
        breaks, too. Fine tune your year-end tax planning to get into the right 
        tax bracket with the right formula for maximum savings. <br>
        <br>
        Here are some tax saving tips:</p>
      <p><em>Upper-income:</em> If you are an upper-income taxpayer on a steady 
        basis, you can safely assume that most middle class AGI-dependent tax 
        breaks won't apply to you. That's too bad, but there are some other powerful 
        savings opportunities. Focus on high-end tax planning strategies for wealthy 
        individuals such as using trusts, family planning, charitable contribution 
        plans, and defined benefit retirement plans. </p>
      <p><em>Middle-class income: </em>If your income is between $50,000 and $160,000, 
        you should consider every possible (AGI-dependent) tax break. Tax writers 
        want the middle class to save for retirement, education, children and 
        more, and know they need some help &#150; hence these breaks. <br>
        <br>
        AMT taxes rarely snag very high income taxpayers (isn't that ironic)? 
        Note that commodities/futures traders have lower &quot;60/40 split&quot; 
        income tax rates (maximum blended rate is 23 percent), which is less than 
        the AMT tax rates (maximum rate of 28 percent), so they may be snagged 
        with AMT even with higher income.<br>
        <br>
        If your income is between $160,000 and $600,000, and you live in a high-taxing 
        state, it's very likely AMT will snag you. So plan ahead! Why pay state 
        taxes in December in order to increase your regular income tax deductions 
        if you get snagged by AMT, which does not allow state tax deductions?</p>
      <p><em>Lower income:</em> If you have little to no income, tax planning 
        and savings may not be your main focus anyway and it's unlikely you need 
        to do year-end tax planning &#150; except if you are a trader! Then you 
        need to consider lots of tax-savings strategies including trader tax status, 
        wash sales, mark-to-market accounting (MTM), start-up expenses, net operating 
        losses, and more.</p>
      <p>There are all sorts of special tax strategies for traders across the 
        income spectrum (high, middle, and low). </p>
      <p><em>Defined benefit plans</em>: If in 2005 you had another stellar year 
        and you are confident about the future being the same, consider a defined 
        benefit retirement plan for huge tax savings. An actuary may calculate 
        that you must contribute very large amounts to the plan over the next 
        several years, but this can save you a fortune in taxes. Plus, you can 
        trade the account for further tax deferral savings. DB plans must be established 
        before year-end and there is much customized paperwork. We need to start 
        by Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p><em>Trading</em>: Perhaps you can buy or sell certain trading and/or 
        investment positions before year-end to fall into the middle class tax 
        savings zone and unlock plenty of breaks. You need to know how close you 
        are to know what is possible. The educated tax consumer gets the most 
        breaks! We suggest you get <a href="http://www.greencompany.com/Traders/Software.shtml">GTT 
        TradeLog</a> now to figure your gains and losses so we don't build a plan 
        on incorrect information. <a href="#yearendtaxplanning2004traders">Click 
        here</a> to read the other year-end tax planning articles by Robert Green. 
      </p>
      <p><em>Roth IRA conversions</em>: If you are having a bad year in the markets, 
        consider the following special strategy: If your AGI is less than $100,000, 
        it might be an excellent time to convert your retirement savings accounts 
        (with tax deferral only) into a Roth IRA (for permanent tax deferral). 
        Also consider that traders can actively trade their Roth IRAs. <a href="http://www.greencompany.com/Traders/TraderRetirement.shtml">Click 
        here</a> to learn more about retirement plans and strategies for trading 
        the funds in those plans. </p>
      <p><em>Business trader tax status</em>: With trader tax status and mark-to-market 
        accounting, you unlock all sorts of business tax breaks. You escape the 
        onerous wash sale rules, capital loss limitations, and phased out itemized 
        and miscellaneous deductions. You also don't have to worry about AMT preferences. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Both winning and losing traders benefit. Winning traders get many ordinary 
        business deductions, and AGI deductions (also ordinary and above the line) 
        for retirement-plan contributions and health-insurance premiums. Losing 
        traders generate net operating losses (NOLs) that generate immediate tax 
        refunds from two-year carrybacks. It's win-win on all levels!<br>
        <br>
        However, it's paramount to review trader tax status in advance of year-end. 
        See Robert Green's <a href="#yearendtaxplanning2004traders">year-end tax 
        planning articles for traders</a> below. There are several clever strategies 
        on converting capital losses into ordinary losses and much more. You won't 
        find that content anywhere else.</p>
      <p>Why be surprised next April 15 to learn you don't have trader tax status? 
        It's wiser to assess your situation now (with <a href="http://www.greencompany.com/Traders/TraderConsulting.shtml">Green's 
        help in a consultation</a> if you like) and help yourself gain trader 
        tax status before year-end. If necessary, you can make a few changes, 
        such as trading more frequently.</p>
      <p>Finally, like other small businesses taxpayers, business traders have 
        opportunities to manage their income and expenses. If you don't have MTM, 
        you can do tax-loss selling before year-end, and create or prevent wash 
        sales depending on your needs. It cuts both way, so read those trader 
        articles below from Green. The same applies to expenses; in some cases 
        you should accelerate them and in others defer them. </p>
      <p>But again, there are so many scenarios that may apply, what seems to 
        be prudent may not be. You may be better off accelerating income and expenses 
        or deferring them, bunching deductions or not. Let us help you figure 
        it all out to your greatest tax advantage.</p>
      <p>The moral of this story is that tax breaks are highly complex and vary 
        significantly by income level. The only way to tell for sure if you can 
        claim a tax break is with good tax software and actual numbers (or good 
        estimates). Almost all taxpayers prepare their tax returns with tax software 
        after year-end and good programs point out tax savings ideas for the future. 
        Why not cash in on good program tools for savings before year-end &#150; 
        when it counts the most?</p>
      <p>Our firm uses the best tax software programs on the market (Lacerte and 
        BNA). Our CPA professionals can automatically input your 2004 tax information 
        (from your 2004 tax return files which we prepared already), then update 
        the information with 2005 actual numbers and/or estimates and then crunch 
        your numbers. Our software and professionals spot every possible savings 
        strategy. </p>
      <p>Here's the bottom line: There is no way you can get every tax benefit 
        you are entitled to without crunching the actual or estimated numbers 
        in an excellent year-end tax planning program. And with our top-flight 
        trader tax CPAs and attorneys, we can deliver the trader and general tax 
        savings you deserve. Yes, it would be fairer for tax savings to flow from 
        the spigot and for money to grow on trees, but it doesn't. You need to 
        engage an expert using the right tools to mine our current income tax 
        code. Vote for tax change tomorrow, but keep playing today's tax game 
        right today. </p>
      <p>Remember, there are lots of good general tax content sites, publishers, 
        and services around and they are very helpful. But traders are a special 
        breed of taxpayer and we have built our practice researching, conceiving, 
        writing, and delivering on traders&#8217; special tax needs. For almost 
        every tax break, there is a special twist or spin for traders. We bring 
        it all to the table. </p>

      <p>By Robert A. Green, CPA</p>
      <p>Investors and active traders have tax-savings opportunities at year-end. 
        Many investors sell losing positions towards the end of the year to lower 
        their capital gains income and capital gains taxes (known as &#8220;tax 
        loss selling&#8221;).<br>
        <br>
        Business traders with <a href="GTTRecMTM.shtml">mark-to-market accounting 
        (MTM)</a> report unrealized gains and losses at year-end, so it's not 
        necessary for them to exit their positions to gain tax savings. There 
        are plenty of things you can do just before year-end to improve your tax 
        situation, but it all depends on your tax status.<br>
        <br>
        Investors and active traders use the default &#8220;cash method&#8221; 
        of accounting, which means they report realized gains and losses, and 
        not open positions (unrealized gains and losses), at year-end. Cash method 
        accounting also includes the dreaded <a href="GTTRecWashSale.shtml">wash-sale</a> 
        and straddle-loss deferral rules. This means certain realized losses are 
        not allowed to be deducted on your current year&#8217;s tax return; instead, 
        they are carried over (deferred) to the following tax year, potentially 
        raising your tax bill for the current year.<br>
        <br>
        The most dreaded part of cash method accounting is the onerous excess 
        capital-loss limitation rules. Congress allows taxpayers to deduct a maximum 
        loss of $3,000 per year, and the balance may be carried forward to future 
        tax years (commodities losses may also be carried <i>back </i>three tax 
        years, although they can only be applied against commodities gains).<br>
        <br>
        Many business traders elected MTM (Internal Revenue Code 475) for securities 
        only (because MTM is not beneficial for commodities) and thereby get around 
        the dreaded aspects of &#8220;cash method&#8221; accounting. MTM business 
        traders are exempt from the onerous wash-sale and straddle-loss deferral 
        rules, and all losses are deductible as ordinary losses without any capital-loss 
        limitations.<br>
        <br>
        Many traders use the cash method for the current year and want to elect 
        MTM in the following year. This raises further complications and requires 
        other strategies. </p>
      <p><strong>Find your tax status and act accordingly</strong><br>
        Your first order of business in late November or early December is to 
        determine what your tax status is for the current tax year. Did you rise 
        to the level of business status (<a href="GTTRecTraderTaxStatus.shtml">trader 
        tax status</a>) for the entire year, or a portion of the year? Will that 
        portion of the year include the year-end?<br>
        <br>
        Did you elect MTM IRC 475 on time in the current tax year, or carry over 
        that election from the prior tax year? Existing taxpayers must elect MTM 
        by April 15 of the current tax year by attaching an election statement 
        to their prior year tax return or extension. New taxpayers don&#8217;t 
        have a prior tax return, so they can elect &#8220;internally&#8221; (in 
        their own books and records).<br>
        <br>
        Some taxpayers miss the MTM election filing and later realize they qualify 
        as a <a href="http://www.greencompany.com/Traders/TraderEntities.shtml#husbandandwife">&#8220;defacto&#8221; 
        husband/wife general partnership</a> because they have joint trading accounts 
        and both worked as traders. Perhaps their defacto partnership made the 
        necessary &#8220;new taxpayer&#8221; internal election with a verbal resolution. 
        If you think you may qualify for a defacto partnership and need to use 
        MTM accounting to deduct large losses in the current year, consult with 
        a proven trader tax expert. For more information, see &quot;I promise 
        to love, honor and save you tax money&quot; in the July 2003 issue of 
        <i>Active Trader. </i>The article explains how husband-wife partnerships 
        require no formal agreement or paperwork, and they can save you a bundle 
        on your tax returns. You can also <a href="http://www.greencompany.com/Traders/TraderEntities.shtml#husbandandwife">click 
        here</a> to learn more.<br>
        <br>
        If you elected MTM but don&#8217;t qualify for trader tax status at year-end, 
        you must use the cash method at year-end (and for any other portion of 
        the year you did not qualify for trader tax status). If you are a business 
        trader without MTM, you must use the cash method like any other investor. 
        You can still take advantage of many business tax breaks, some of which 
        require action before year-end.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>&#8221;Cash method&#8221; accounting trading strategies to lower 
        your taxes at year-end</strong><br>
        If you are an active trader but don&#8217;t qualify for business treatment 
        (trader tax status) &#150; or, if you do qualify but did not elect MTM 
        IRC 475 &#150; you must use the default &#8220;cash method&#8221; of accounting. 
        Here are some tips for lowering your taxes at year-end:<br>
        <br>
        Manage your portfolio at year-end to defer unrealized capital gains and 
        realize capital losses, which lowers your capital gains and capital gains 
        taxes.<br>
        <br>
        Hold securities positions for 12 months to avoid short-term capital gains 
        (which are taxed at ordinary tax rates up to 35 percent) using hedges 
        in order to benefit from long-term capital gains (which are capped at 
        a 15-percent tax rate). The 2003 tax act lowered both rates, but it also 
        widened the difference, making this strategy more beneficial than in prior 
        years.<br>
        <br>
        Avoid wash-sale and straddle-loss deferrals by re-entering similar, rather 
        than identical, positions within 30 days.<br>
        <br>
        Avoid purchasing mutual funds just after dividend declaration dates, which 
        usually occur around the end of the year. Price often drops after dividends.</p>
      <p>Avoid capital-loss carryovers. Don&#8217;t exceed the $3,000 capital-loss 
        carryover. This creates &#8220;tax baggage&#8221; for business traders 
        (see below). <br>
        <br>
        When planning for capital-loss limitations and estimated taxes, anticipate 
        mutual fund capital-gain distributions. <br>
        <br>
        Avoid investment-interest carryovers and investment-expense limitations. 
        Both require investment income for these deductions. Figure out your investment 
        income (portfolio income and capital gains).<br>
        <br>
        Find out if your hedge fund or investment company Form K-1s will report 
        trading gains and losses using the cash or MTM methods of accounting (trader 
        tax status and this accounting election is on the entity level).<br>
        <br>
        Consider allocating some of your &#8220;taxable portfolio&#8221; to tax-free 
        investments and tax-free retirement accounts (with tax-deductible or non-deductible 
        contributions). <br>
        <br>
        Consider shifting income to other family members. Children younger than 
        14 are subject to the &#8220;kiddie tax&#8221; rules, which allow lower 
        tax rates on the first $1,500 of &#8220;unearned&#8221; income (the excess 
        is taxed at the parents&#8217; tax rates). Children 14 or older are not 
        eligible for the &#8220;kiddie tax&#8221; rules. Consider paying your 
        children wages to help in your trading business; you both are exempt from 
        payroll taxes and can benefit from the child&#8217;s lower tax bracket 
        rates. <br>
        <br>
        Contribute appreciated securities to charity. You get a tax-deductible 
        contribution at the higher fair market value (FMV). You are exempt from 
        capital-gains taxes on the increase of FMV over purchase price. This is 
        wiser then paying capital-gains taxes and then contributing cash to the 
        charity.<br>
        <br>
        Commodities and futures traders (with or without trader tax status) are 
        automatically subject to another type of mark-to-market accounting, IRC 
        Section 1256. They report &#8220;economic&#8221; gains and losses and 
        can&#8217;t manage their income with the above strategies. Commodities 
        losses can be carried back three tax years against commodities gains, 
        so plan accordingly.<br>
        <br>
        If you are in low tax brackets in 2003 and expect to be in high tax brackets 
        for 2004, you may want to reverse some of these strategies.</p>
      <p><strong>There are lower 2003 Act tax rates on qualifying dividends and 
        long-term capital gains.</strong><br>
        Arrange your investments to take advantage of the new lower tax rates 
        on &#8220;qualifying&#8221; dividends, paid by domestic and qualifying 
        foreign corporations. Pay careful attention to the detailed rules; most 
        traders won&#8217;t get these benefits, except on their &#8220;segregated&#8221; 
        investment accounts.<br>
        <br>
        &#8220;Dividends&#8221; from money market funds, life insurance policies, 
        real estate investment trusts (REITS &#8211; 90-percent portion) and some 
        mutual funds do not qualify. Many mutual funds invest in bonds, currencies 
        and other instruments that do not have qualifying corporate earnings and 
        profit taxes. <br>
        <br>
        The &#8220;holding period&#8221; for qualifying dividends is 60 of 120 
        days before the ex-dividend date, which will ruin this benefit for many 
        traders (those that don't hold positions that long). <br>
        <br>
        The &#8220;effective date&#8221; for lower long-term capital-gains rates 
        is May 5, 2003.<br>
        <br>
        Carefully plan to offset capital gains and losses to maximize post-May 
        5, 2003 long-term capital gains. <br>
        <br>
        Shift investment income to children (with annual gift limits) to take 
        advantage of the two lowest tax brackets (5 percent) on long-term capital 
        gains.<br>

      <p><strong>MTM traders can&#8217;t manage income, but they have many other 
        tax-saving opportunities, including net operating losses (NOL).</strong><br>
        Unlike traders who use the default cash method of accounting, MTM business 
        traders (and all commodities and futures traders) report both realized 
        and &#8220;unrealized&#8221; gains and losses at year-end. <br>
        <br>
        MTM business traders may not defer capital gains on trading positions, 
        but can on &#8220;segregated&#8221; investment positions. <br>
        <br>
        MTM business traders are not penalized with the onerous wash-sale and 
        straddle-loss deferral rules and capital-loss limitations; all realized 
        and unrealized trading losses are deducible in the current tax year in 
        full as ordinary losses (not capital losses). <br>
        <br>
        MTM business traders can have negative taxable income and carry back &#8220;<a href="GTTRecNOL.shtml">net 
        operating losses</a>&#8221; (the business portion of trading expenses 
        and trading losses) two tax years (or five years for 2001 and 2002 only).<br>
        <br>
        Carefully plan your NOLs in advance in order to receive immediate tax 
        refund relief for prior years in which you have taxable income taxed at 
        higher marginal rates. For example, if you have significant taxable income 
        in 2001 but losses in 2002, try to increase your 2003 NOL so you can carry 
        the NOL back to 2001. You won&#8217;t be able to carry back a 2004 NOL 
        for any benefit in 2002 and 2003, two losing years (since you have losses 
        in those carryback years). Instead, you can carry forward your 2004 NOL 
        to 2005 and beyond (up to 15 years).<br>
        <br>
        Traders without MTM can still generate a NOL with their trading-business 
        expenses.<br>
        <br>
        MTM traders don&#8217;t need to worry about tax-loss selling. They can 
        take profits early and not worry about trying to defer capital gains. 
        They also don't have to worry about rushing to sell a losing position 
        to lock in the tax loss; it is already locked in with MTM.</p>
      <p><strong>Switching to MTM from cash method accounting is difficult if 
        you have tax baggage.</strong><br>
        Business traders face complex issues when they consider switching to MTM 
        from the default cash method (capital gains and losses). The most important 
        issue concerns capital loss carryovers.</p>
      <p><strong>Capital loss carryovers are the main culprit for putting traders 
        out of business.</strong><br>
        Not being able to deduct your trading losses because of capital-loss limitation 
        and wash-sale rules is sort of like paying full-service brokerage commissions. 
        It can accelerate your exit from a trading business. </p>
      <p>It&#8217;s foolish to pay full-service brokerage commissions if you trade 
        on your own with an online or direct-access brokerage firm. It&#8217;s 
        also foolish to not get exempt from the capital-loss limitation rules 
        on securities if you are a business trader. All that is necessary is a 
        little free education about how and when to elect MTM. You can&#8217;t 
        tell a full service broker to give you a refund because you later learned 
        about better offerings, and you also can&#8217;t tell the IRS later on 
        to allow you to use MTM. The IRS is very strict about denying late MTM 
        elections.<br>
        <br>
        Many traders skip the MTM election when they start their trading business 
        because they don&#8217;t know about it, get the wrong advice and/or make 
        the wrong decision about it. The latter is certainly the case if they 
        get stuck with capital loss carryovers. </p>
      <p>You can carry back MTM losses for immediate tax refunds to replenish 
        your trading accounts rather than having carried-over &quot;capital losses&quot; 
        suspended to future years. Many traders never cash in on those capital-loss 
        carryovers after having to exit a trading business. They simply have no 
        or little money left to invest for capital gains.<br>
        <br>
        These non-MTM traders fall into the following tax trap, because you can&#8217;t 
        have it both ways. If you have trading gains in the following year, you 
        want to keep the cash method to offset new trading capital gains with 
        capital loss carryovers. If you have trading losses, you want to have 
        MTM for ordinary loss treatment, as it's adding fuel to your fire to add 
        to your capital-loss carryovers. <br>
        <br>
        If you have large trading losses by April 15, it&#8217;s probably safer 
        to elect MTM to insure ordinary loss treatment. Conversely, if you have 
        large trading gains, it may be OK to skip the MTM election and gamble 
        on having net trading gains for the year (and using your capital-loss 
        carryovers). If you have small gains or losses, your MTM election decision 
        is a gamble. <br>
        <br>
        Consider electing MTM on securities only (not commodities) and utilizing 
        other ways to generate capital gains to use up your capital-loss carryovers. 
      </p>
      <p>Start trading commodities such as the E-Minis, which may be similar to 
        securities products you trade. E-Minis and other commodities will not 
        be subject to MTM treatment (unless you also elect MTM on commodities) 
        and will instead generate capital gains and losses. Your first set of 
        commodities gains will be tax-free because you will offset them with your 
        capital loss carryovers. Afterwards, you will benefit from the lower tax 
        rates on commodities. 60 percent is long-term capital gains (capped at 
        a 15-percent tax rates) and 40 percent is short-term capital gains (which 
        are taxed at up to 35 percent). That translates to a maximum blended rate 
        of 23 percent on commodities vs. a maximum rate of 35 percent on short-term 
        securities trading. Instead of trading the QQQQ, an exchange traded fund 
        (ETF) taxed as a &#8220;security,&#8221; trade the E-Mini, a similar market 
        risk instrument taxed as a &#8220;commodity.&#8221; <a href="GTTRecCFMA.shtml"><br>
        <br>
        </a>Traders have a large variety of new financial products to trade: ETFs, 
        E-Minis, single-stock futures, plenty of new indices, and options and 
        futures on almost everything. Learn how all these new products are taxed 
        &#8211; as securities or commodities &#8211; and consider that commodities 
        have lower tax rates. <a href="GTTRecCFMA.shtml">Click here.</a><br>
        <br>
        Another way to use up capital-loss carryovers is to &#8220;segregate&#8221; 
        some securities as &#8220;investment positions,&#8221; not subject to 
        MTM. For starters, their capital gains are tax-free. And, if you hold 
        them for 12 months, the capital gains are taxed at the lower long-term 
        capital gains rates. If you believe the markets have turned the corner 
        from bear to bull, this may be a timely strategy.</p>
      <p>Limit capital losses and then covert some into wash sales for ordinary 
        loss treatment next year.<br>
        The higher your capital-loss carryovers; the harder it is for you to make 
        the switch to MTM. <br>
        First, try to limit the amount of your capital-loss carryovers.<br>
        <br>
        If you already reached the capital-loss limitation, sell profitable positions 
        and keep open losing positions. Hedge accordingly. Don&#8217;t sell any 
        additional losing positions. More losses won&#8217;t benefit your current 
        year&#8217;s taxes, and they will make your MTM election in the following 
        year a tougher decision to make.<br>
        <br>
        If you do sell losing positions that generate a capital-loss carryover, 
        consider re-entering the position within 30 days to create a beneficial 
        wash-sale condition (in all other cases, wash sales are not beneficial). 
        If you elect MTM in the following year, wash-sale loss deferrals are better 
        than capital-loss carryovers because wash sales can be converted into 
        ordinary losses, whereas capital-loss carryovers may never be converted 
        into ordinary losses (and remain as your tax baggage).<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Pay your bills early for additional tax savings, providing you 
        don&#8217;t trigger AMT taxes and AGI limitations.</strong><br>
        All taxpayers should consider paying more bills early before year-end 
        to maximize current year tax deductions. <br>
        <br>
        Taxpayers and most sole proprietor business traders use the cash method 
        of accounting rather than the accrual method of accounting. This is different 
        from the cash vs. MTM methods of accounting as they apply to trading gains 
        and losses. Cash accounting is when bills are paid; accrual accounting 
        is when expenses are incurred. Credit card purchases are cash items on 
        the date purchased, not when the credit card bill is paid. <br>
        <br>
        Normal taxpayers and investors may want to consider &#8220;bunching&#8221; 
        their itemized deductions into the current year and then taking a standard 
        deduction in the following year. There is no sense coming up short on 
        the standard deduction every year and wasting some itemized deductions 
        such as charitable contributions.<br>
        <br>
        Again, watch out for that dreaded Alternative Minimum Tax, because many 
        itemized deductions are not deductible for AMT (including investment interest, 
        all taxes and miscellaneous itemized deductions). <br>
        <br>
        Calculate if your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) will be significantly lower 
        in the following tax year. Many itemized deductions and other tax breaks 
        (see below) are limited by AGI levels. Medical expenses are deductible 
        in excess of 7.5 percent of your AGI. Miscellaneous itemized deductions, 
        including non-reimbursed employee business expenses, job-hunting expenses, 
        education expenses (except for business traders) and investment expenses 
        are only deductible in excess of 2 percent of AGI. You also need to beware 
        of casualty losses.<br>
        <br>
        Business expenses are not added back for AMT tax calculations.</p>
      <p><strong>Business traders should lower their AGI to unlock &#8220;middle-class&#8221; 
        tax breaks.</strong><br>
        Business traders should accelerate expenses for two good reasons:<br>
        <br>
        First, additional business expenses lower your taxable income, which lowers 
        your tax bill. If you have a net operating loss, additional expenses increase 
        your NOL and related NOL tax refunds. The sooner the better when it comes 
        to NOLs, as you can only go back two tax years.<br>
        <br>
        Secondly, a business trader should know about many special tax breaks 
        which are based on AGI levels. These breaks are &#8220;phased out&#8221; 
        at different levels of AGI, hence their common name: &#8220;middle-class 
        tax breaks.&#8221;<br>
        <br>
        Business traders often go from rags to riches and vice versa in any given 
        year. One year their AGI may be very high and most tax breaks are phased 
        out. In other years, they have low AGI and their window opens to put in 
        place many of these middle-class tax breaks.<br>
        <br>
        For example, if your AGI is less than $100,000, you can convert a taxable 
        retirement plan into a Roth IRA, which can convert &#8220;timing&#8221; 
        tax-free build up into &#8220;permanent&#8221; tax-free build up (every 
        trader's dream scenario). See more details on this strategy below.<br>
        <br>
        Here are some other tax breaks limited to certain AGI levels: IRA contributions, 
        Roth IRA conversions, education credits, Coverdell education savings accounts, 
        interest on student loans, exemptions for children, earned income credit, 
        real estate passive activity losses and social security income exclusions, 
        to name a few.</p>
      <p>Read about them and the phase out amounts at <a href="http://www.irs.gov" target="_blank">www.irs.gov</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Business traders should buy more equipment before year-end for 
        their home office</strong><br>
        If you have trading gains in excess of your trading-business expenses, 
        accelerate fixed asset purchases before year-end to maximize section 179 
        (100 percent) depreciation and home-office deductions. Both deductions 
        require income; otherwise you must carry them over to the following year. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Section 179 depreciation limits were raised to $100,000 for 2003 from 
        $24,000 in 2002. If you don&#8217;t have income, opt for accelerated &#8220;bonus&#8221; 
        depreciation instead. <br>
        <br>
        Don&#8217;t shy away from home-office deductions. They are no longer a 
        red flag and they won&#8217;t interfere with your home-sale gain exclusion.</p>
      <p><strong>Deduct health-insurance premiums and retirement plans to lower 
        your AGI</strong><br>
        AGI deductions for sole proprietor businesses (Schedule C) include, but 
        are not limited to, retirement-plan deductions, health-insurance premiums 
        and 50 percent of self-employment taxes.<br>
        The problem for traders is that, unlike other sole proprietor businesses, 
        they may not take these AGI deductions unless they create some &#8220;earned 
        income.&#8221; Trading gains with or without MTM are not earned income. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Traders can form an entity for their trading business and have their entity 
        pay them, as owner/manager, a fee. This management fee is reported on 
        a second Schedule C, which is earned income subject to self-employment 
        taxes and which can drive a health-insurance premium deduction and contribution 
        to a tax-deductible retirement plan.<br>
        <br>
        Alternatively, a trader can pay their spouse a fee for helping them manage 
        their trading business, with the requirement that the spouse not be an 
        owner of the trading business. A Schedule C owner may not pay his or herself 
        a fee or salary. If the husband and wife are both owners, then they cannot 
        file a Schedule C. Instead, they are a &#8220;defacto&#8221; general partnership 
        and must file a partnership tax return. A guaranteed payment can then 
        be declared in lieu of a fee to accomplish the same earned income result. 
        <br>
        <br>
        If you paid your spouse money during the year and he or she did help you 
        in your trading business, you may be able to structure this all at year-end 
        or early in the following year. Consult with a trader tax expert if you 
        have further questions. It can be well worth it. <a href="http://www.greencompany.com/Traders/TraderEntities.shtml">Click 
        here</a> for more information on husband/wife general partnerships. <br>
        <br>
        Paying fees to your children older than 14 also lowers your AGI. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>Favorable Mini 401(k) retirement plans must be established before 
        year-end</strong><br>
        Establish a Mini 401(k) retirement plan for you and/or your spouse before 
        year-end with nominal funds. The balance of your tax-deductible contribution 
        can be calculated and paid after year-end. <br>
        <br>
        All &#8220;qualified&#8221; retirement plans must be established before 
        year-end, including 401(k) plans, Mini 401(k) plans, profit-sharing plans 
        and defined benefit plans.<br>
        <br>
        Qualified plans must be fully funded for annual contributions by the due 
        date of your tax return, including extensions (up to Oct. 15 of the following 
        year).<br>
        <br>
        IRA and Roth IRA plans must be established and contributions must be made 
        by April 15 of the following year. SEP IRA plans, another type of profit-sharing 
        plan for business owners, may be both established and funded up until 
        the due date of your tax return, including extensions. If you miss the 
        Mini 401(k) plan setup before year end, use a SEP IRA instead.<br>
        <br>
        Otherwise, Mini 401(k) plans are the most attractive for traders. You 
        need fee income rather than trading income to fund a retirement plan. 
        Therefore, owners/managers need a trading or investment entity such as 
        a general partnership, LLC or S-Corp to pay them a fee before year-end. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Recent tax law changes increased the annual profit-sharing contribution 
        limit from $25,000 in 2002 to $40,000 for 2003 and $41,000 for 2004. <br>

      <p><strong>Roth IRAs are also attractive for traders.</strong><br>
        Roth IRAs are especially attractive for traders. Their main tax features 
        are &#8220;permanent&#8221; tax-free savings on portfolio income, and 
        traders know how to maximize portfolio savings.<br>
        <br>
        Roth IRA contributions (limited to $3,000 per year) are not tax deductible, 
        but the corresponding good news is that distributions in retirement are 
        not taxable.<br>
        <br>
        Traditional IRA contributions (limited to $3,000 per year) are tax deductible 
        (up to certain AGI levels), but the corresponding bad news is that distributions 
        in retirement are taxable at the higher ordinary income tax rates (up 
        to 35 percent).<br>
        <br>
        Roth IRAs provide for &#8220;permanent&#8221; tax savings on the portfolio 
        income buildup, whereas traditional IRAs (and qualified retirement plans) 
        only provide &#8220;temporary&#8221; tax savings. Traditional IRAs are 
        not attractive for traders. It might be a better idea to &#8220;buy and 
        hold&#8221; securities for the long term &#150; no tax is due until sale 
        of the securities and lower long-term capital gains tax rates (up to 15 
        percent) apply. <br>
        <br>
        A note of caution: If you operate a business (trading or otherwise) in 
        a retirement account, the IRS may classify it as a &#8220;prohibited transaction&#8221; 
        which makes you subject to penalties. Play it safe and only trade 25 percent 
        actively. <br>
        <br>
        Note: All retirement plan contributions require &#8220;earned income.&#8221;</p>
      <p><strong> Get more bang for your buck with a Roth IRA conversion</strong><br>
        Roth IRAs are great for traders, but many traders can&#8217;t get much 
        bang for their buck out of that puny $3,000 non-deductible contribution 
        per year (which you can make even if you have other retirement plans).<br>
        <br>
        There is a better solution. You may &#8220;convert&#8221; an existing 
        retirement plan into a Roth IRA. The one caveat is that you must pay all 
        income taxes on the ordinary income portion of the conversion in the year 
        of conversion. The requirement is that your &#8220;modified AGI&#8221; 
        is less than $100,000 in the year of conversion, before the converted 
        income is added in.<br>
        <br>
        The conversion rules are complex, so visit <a href="http://www.irs.gov" target="_blank">www.irs.gov 
        </a>to learn more. You may only convert from an IRA to a Roth IRA, so 
        if you have a qualified retirement plan, do a Rollover IRA direct transfer 
        first.<br>
        <br>
        The IRS treats the Roth converted amount as ordinary income (an &#8220;early 
        withdrawal&#8221;), but you are exempt from the additional normal &#8220;early 
        withdrawal&#8221; excise tax penalties of 10 percent.<br>
        <br>
        Not included in ordinary income are non-deductible contributions (and 
        certain employer matched contributions in 401(k) plans). <br>
        <br>
        If your existing retirement plans have been battered by the recent bear 
        markets, it&#8217;s an ideal time to consider this conversion. You will 
        have lower conversion income taxed at ordinary rates and the recovery 
        of these assets will be tax-free. <br>
        <br>
        So if you had a bad year in 2003, it can be worth your while to do this 
        conversion. Rather than carry back a NOL, which can cause an IRS exam 
        (which you don't want if you are a close call on trader tax status), do 
        a Roth conversion to use up your losses. Don&#8217;t just stop at zero 
        taxable income &#150; consider taking advantage of the lower tax brackets 
        with some positive taxable income. <br>
        <br>
        You can stop wherever you like by only converting a portion of your retirement 
        plans to the Roth IRA. </p>
      <p><strong>Fringe Benefits Plans and Flexible Spending Accounts</strong><br>
        If you are interested in opportunities to convert more of your non-deductible 
        family expenses into deductible business expenses, you should learn about 
        &#8220;fringe benefit&quot; plans.</p>
      <p>Most small businesses, including trading businesses, overlook fringe 
        benefit plans; many larger companies rely on fringe benefit plans to attract 
        and retain employees. <br>
        <br>
        Fringe benefits, commonly known as &#8220;perks,&#8221; include: retirement 
        plans; health, life and disability insurance; education, dependent care 
        and adoption assistance; meals, lodging and parking; and many other types 
        of plans.<br>
        <br>
        Self-employed individuals (and pass-through entity owner/employees) who 
        want to benefit from fringe benefit plans can do so if their spouses work 
        for the business. By covering employees and spouses, they become entitled 
        to benefits by virtue of being the spouse of an employee. </p>
      <p><a href="GTTRecFringeBenefitPlans.shtml">Click here</a> to learn more 
        about fringe benefit plans. </p>
      <p><strong>Choose the right entity early.</strong><br>
        You still may have time before year-end to choose the right entity for 
        your trading business to provide the tax benefits you need (retirement 
        plans, health insurance premiums and fringe benefit plans among them). 
        <br>
        <br>
        If you want to use your entity for the following year, it&#8217;s beneficial 
        to form the entity just before year-end and to commence its operations 
        on Jan. 1 of the following year. It may take a few weeks to form the entity 
        and open the trading accounts. Starting in November or early December 
        is prudent. <br>

        If you commence your business operations after the start of the tax year, 
        you will have a more complex tax filing for the following year; with sole 
        proprietor operations for the first part of the year and the entity operations 
        for the balance of the tax year. <br>
        <br>
        Traders prefer &#8220;pass-through&#8221; entities to avoid double taxation 
        in a C-Corp, on both the entity level (up to a 34-percent tax rate) and 
        again on the individual level (up to 15 percent, if there are qualifying 
        dividends). Pass-through entities have single taxation on only the individual 
        level (rates up to 35 percent).<br>
        <br>
        Traders also prefer pass-through entities to utilize ordinary losses on 
        their individual tax returns. This allows them to offset other types of 
        income and get NOL carrybacks. Losses are often trapped in C-Corps for 
        many years to come. <br>

      <p><strong>Plan your business start-up, suspension and exit well.</strong><br>
        There are many important tax-planning issues to consider when you start 
        up your trading business, when you suspend it and when you exit it.<br>
        <br>
        The key in all cases is to maximize your business expenses and to use 
        MTM accounting during the period of business activity (not before or after 
        it). <br>
        <br>
        Business expenses paid outside the period of business activity may be 
        &#8220;start-up expenses,&#8221;&#8220;investment expenses&#8221; (restricted 
        and limited) or non-deductible expenses.<br>
        <br>
        Trading losses outside the period of business activity may not utilize 
        MTM accounting, meaning those capital losses will be subject to the capital-loss 
        limitation. If the business activity stops before year-end, the trader 
        must deal with the onerous wash-sale and straddle-loss deferral rules 
        at year-end. Before year-end, if you believe you are falling short of 
        qualification, try to increase your trading activity by trading tiny amounts 
        or taking very small risks. Commissions are low enough these days to make 
        this strategy worthwhile.<br>
        <br>
        If you know you are exiting your trading business, make sure to pay all 
        your business expenses before you close your trading accounts (or slow 
        the activity to a point you no longer qualify).<br>
        <br>
        If you use MTM, you can mark all open positions to market on the date 
        of exit and start with that market value for cash accounting going forward. 
        Play it safer and sell all open positions before you exit the trading 
        business. However, most traders don&#8217;t know they exited until after 
        the fact.<br>
        <br>
        If you exit your trading business and have an open section 481 adjustment, 
        you will have to report the remaining deferred income in the year of exit 
        (and it may trigger estimated taxes in the quarter you exit). It may pay 
        to try to continue to qualify through year-end to defer a 481 adjustment 
        one more year. <br>

        adjustments. <br>
        <br>
        If you stop trading for a while but plan to resume soon, you are in a 
        complex situation without much guidance from the IRS. It&#8217;s wise 
        to re-elect MTM in the following year in case the IRS considers you to 
        have exited and then re-entered a trading business. You should consult 
        with a proven trader tax expert.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Start-up expenses.</strong><br>
        In general, your costs for acquiring a capital asset, including the start 
        of a business, are added to the cost basis of your asset and not deducted 
        until the business is sold or closed.<br>
        <br>
        There is a special rule for &#8220;start-up&#8221; expenses (IRC Section 
        195). Start-up expenses may be amortized (expensed) over not less than 
        60 months on a straight-line basis. Start-up expenses must meet three 
        requirements: expenses must be paid in connection with &#8220;investigating&#8221; 
        the creation of your trading business (easy for traders); they must be 
        a normal expense of the business (also easy for traders); and they must 
        not be interest, taxes, or research and development, each of which has 
        its own tax treatment. <br>
        <br>
        Many traders spend considerable funds before entering a trading business. 
        They attend seminars, educational programs, buy computers and start using 
        trading tools for mock trading. Later, when they see success from simulated 
        trading, they open a brokerage account and start their actual trading 
        activity.<br>
        <br>
        It&#8217;s wise to open your trading account early and trade very small 
        sums with very small risk before you pay for many business expenses. </p>
      <p><strong>Pay education expenses after you start trading</strong><br>
        Education expenses are only deductible after you start your trading business, 
        with one exception. If you are already in a trading-related profession 
        or business, such as a stock broker, then it's deductible for &quot;maintaining 
        and improving your job or business skills.&quot;<br>
        <br>
        Education expenses may not be lumped in with start-up expenses. Investors 
        can't deduct education expenses, even after trading (because they don&#8217;t 
        have business status). <br>
        <br>
        Education expenses for qualifying institutions (undergraduate or post-graduate 
        school) can be utilized for education credits. Trading schools are not 
        qualifying institutions. <br>
        <br>
        There may be room for interpretation. Aggressively considering trading 
        schools as a way to &#8220;investigate&#8221; a trading business and then 
        including these expenses as amortizable start-up expenses is a possible 
        idea.<br>

        plans. <a href="GTTRecFringeBenefitPlans.shtml">Click here</a>. </p>
      <p><strong>Trading gains require timely tax payments to avoid penalties 
        and interest.</strong><br>
        Trading and investment income is subject to the estimated tax payment 
        rules.<br>
        <br>
        This income is not part of an employee W-2; therefore there is no employer 
        to withhold your taxes. If you are late with estimated tax payments, consider 
        asking your employer to withhold additional amounts from your paycheck 
        at year-end. A tax loophole treats all W-2 tax withholding as being ratably 
        done throughout the tax year.<br>
        <br>
        Estimated tax payment rules call for paying your tax obligations on a 
        quarterly basis. Read about these rules at <a href="http://www.irs.gov" target="_blank">www.irs.gov</a>. 
        Read about the &#8220;safe harbor&#8221; rules, which provide for paying 
        a lower amount based on your prior year&#8217;s taxes. <br>
        <br>
        Estimated tax payment rules are not a good match for trading businesses 
        and provide headaches for many traders who face the following problem: 
        They may make a fortune in the first quarter only to lose it all in the 
        later quarters. They then must wait until the following tax year to file 
        their tax returns and get these refunds back. One could argue, though, 
        that if you lost money in the later quarters, it was safer to leave some 
        capital with Uncle Sam rather than in your trading account.<br>
        <br>
        Some traders consider the underestimated non-deductible tax penalty of 
        4 percent per annum an attractive &#8220;margin loan&#8221; rate. The 
        IRS changes the rate often, and the current rate is fairly low. <br>
        <br>
        Even if you want to borrow from Uncle Sam as long as possible (until April 
        15, when you have to pay 90 percent of your taxes for the prior year or 
        be subject to additional penalties and interest), it&#8217;s a good idea 
        to pay some or all of your state taxes before year-end to maximize your 
        itemized deductions for additional tax savings.<br>
        <br>
        Note: State taxes are not deductible for alternative minimum tax (AMT), 
        so there's no sense paying early if you don&#8217;t get a tax benefit.

      <p><strong>Bottom line</strong><br>
        The tax code is very complex for all taxpayers. For traders it&#8217;s 
        even more complex, with myriad investment rules and complexities of trader 
        tax status. To make things even more difficult, the tax code has different 
        breaks for different income levels, and traders move quickly between these 
        levels. How can a trader keep one eye on the markets and another on mastering 
        the tax code? The answer is they can't, so they need a trader tax expert 
        to help. This once a year &#8220;general checkup&#8221; is most effective 
        just before the end of the year. We suggest you consider a <a href="http://www.greencompany.com/Traders/TraderConsulting.shtml">consultation</a>

      <p> Wise taxpayers should do their tax planning before year-end. Traders 
        have special circumstances that make year-end tax planning even more paramount. 
        Certain moves can save you a fortune come April 15.<br>
        <br>
        By Robert A. Green, CPA</p>
      <p>Self-employed business traders have more tax responsibilities than employees 
        (who have their taxes withheld and paid by their employers). For example, 
        self-employed persons must pay their own estimated income taxes (on a 
        quarterly basis) and they must file business tax returns (Schedule C for 
        individuals). These responsibilities can be burdensome. <br>
        <br>
        The good news for self-employed persons is that with added responsibilities 
        come many opportunities for tax benefits. Self-employed persons also have 
        many options for different accounting treatment, and they control their 
        own tax destiny. However, much of that tax destiny expires at year-end, 
        meaning you must make certain moves before year-end to improve your tax 
        results.<br>
        <br>
        Traders are a special breed of self-employed persons. They have all the 
        same rules and opportunities that regular self-employed businesses have, 
        plus additional headaches or opportunities when it comes to dealing with 
        trader tax status, wash sales, straddle rules, constructive receipts, 
        mark-to-market (MTM) accounting and Section 481(a) adjustments.<br>
        <br>
        For all these reasons, it is paramount that business traders deal with 
        these tax issues before year-end, come up with a good year-end tax planning 
        strategy and execute that strategy on time. <br>
        &#8220;Cash method&#8221; business traders (such as investors) in securities 
        are stuck with the onerous application of various tax-loss deferral rules 
        including: wash-sale and loss-deferral rules; year-end tax straddles and 
        constructive receipt transactions; and annual net capital-loss limitation 
        ($3,000 per year for individuals, zero for C-corporations). <br>
        <br>
        It is important to see ahead of time how these &#8220;capital-loss treatment&#8221; 
        limitation rules might affect your trading around the year-end period. 
        Many traders find it advantageous to make minor changes to their trading 
        programs to result in better results tax-wise. <br>
        <br>
        MTM business traders are able to avoid the above &#8220;capital-loss treatment&#8221; 
        headaches. MTM traders report their &#8220;economic&#8221; trading gains 
        and losses (realized and unrealized gains and losses). MTM traders do 
        not have to sell securities at year-end for &#8220;tax selling,&#8221; 
        which can save them commissions. Wash sales and straddles rules are both 
        irrelevant, as MTM traders are specifically exempt from them. <br>
        <br>
        MTM traders have ordinary gain or loss treatment on their trading positions 
        and cash method treatment on their &#8220;segregated&#8221; investment 
        positions. It is important to seek all this out before year-end to see 
        where you stand.<br>
        <br>
        By planning ahead, a cash method securities trader planning to elect MTM 
        for the following tax year may convert unutilized &#8220;unrealized&#8221; 
        capital losses into ordinary tax losses for the following tax year (see 
        example below).<br>
        <br>
        Like other self-employed taxpayers, business traders may accelerate business 
        deductions and estimated state income tax payments into the current tax 
        year. That can save you significant income taxes, even though it&#8217;s 
        just a &#8220;timing&#8221; benefit.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>First, figure out your general gameplan before year-end</strong>.<br>
        A first step in year-end tax planning for a trader is to assess whether 
        or not the trader qualifies for trader tax status for all or part of the 
        current tax year. <br>
        <br>
        If you do not qualify for trader tax status as of year-end, you may not 
        use mark-to-market accounting, even if you elected it on time or carried 
        over that accounting method from the prior tax year. In this case, though, 
        you may qualify for trader tax status for the earlier part of the tax 
        year and use MTM accounting (ordinary loss treatment) for that period 
        only. You will be stuck with the onerous &#8220;capital-loss treatment&#8221; 
        limitations at year-end.<br>
        <br>
        Don&#8217;t wait until tax time in the following year to make this determination 
        of &#8220;trader tax status;&#8221; it may be too late if you want to 
        take advantage of year-end tax strategies.<br>
        <br>
        If you don&#8217;t qualify for trader tax status at year-end, but plan 
        to qualify starting in January of the following year, don&#8217;t accelerate 
        your business expenses per the above tax strategy. You will be accelerating 
        &#8220;investment expenses,&#8221; which may not generate tax benefits. 
        It would be better to defer investment expenses and turn them into business 
        expenses in the following tax year.</p>
      <p><strong>Calculate your trading and investment gains and losses before 
        year end. </strong><br>
        Traders need to have a good handle on their trade accounting well before 
        year-end if they want the opportunity to plan around wash sales, straddles, 
        constructive receipts and conversion to MTM in the following year. <br>
        <br>
        It is also important to have separate accountings for trading gains and 
        losses vs. &#8220;segregated&#8221; investment gains and losses. MTM traders 
        use MTM for trading gains and losses, but they still must use cash method 
        accounting for &#8220;segregated&#8221; investment positions. <br>
        <br>
        Segregation is supposed to be done &#8220;contemporaneously&#8221; on 
        the date you acquire a position. All positions in a trading account are 
        by default a trading position unless you label it an investment position 
        and then hold it accordingly for a certain period of time. The segregation 
        rules are complex and beyond the scope of this discussion.<br>
        <br>
        Traders should have all these accounting components in place before they 
        embark on year-end tax planning. <br>
        <br>
        Many brokerage firms have profit and loss reports available online. Take 
        caution that many of them have &#8220;unmatched trades&#8221; and/or they 
        do not account for wash sales, straddles, constructive receipts or MTM 
        if you are a MTM trader.<br>
        <br>
        You can use a good trade accounting software program such as our &#8220;<a href="http://www.greencompany.com/Traders/Software.shtml">GTT 
        TradeLog</a>&#8221; to import all your trades for the entire year. For 
        cash method traders, the program calculates wash sales, and makes the 
        Section 481 adjustment for the following tax year. For MTM traders, the 
        program calculates year-end MTM imputed sales using year-end prices downloaded 
        off the Internet.<br>
        <br>
        Cash method traders have many tax opportunities and pitfalls at year-end. 
        Without proper tax planning, profitable and losing traders may be stuck 
        with &#8220;capital-loss treatment&#8221; limitations including wash sales, 
        straddle rules and constructive receipts. Losing traders are also limited 
        by the capital-loss limitation each year.<br>
        <br>
        Wash-sale conditions exist when a trader re-enters a losing trade within 
        30 days or exiting the losing trade (i.e., closing the position). Straddle 
        rules and constructive receipt rules apply when a trader has an &#8220;offsetting 
        position&#8221; &#150; he or she takes a loss on one part of the position 
        but holds the offsetting gain position open at year-end. The IRS seeks 
        to prevent cash method traders from playing games by taking losses in 
        one year and deferring offsetting positions with gains into the next tax 
        year. This makes sense by design, but it is a nightmare for most traders 
        and they are not trying to play games with the IRS. <br>

        Wash sales, straddle rules and constructive receipts are beyond the scope 
        of this article. <a href="GTTRecWashSale.shtml">Click here</a> for more 
        information on wash sales. <br>
        <br>
        <strong>MTM method traders are exempt from &#8220;capital-loss limitation&#8221; 
        rules</strong>.<br>
        MTM business traders have it much easier at year-end than cash method 
        traders. MTM traders don&#8217;t have to worry about year-end &#8220;tax 
        selling&#8221; of trading positions. They are exempt from wash sales, 
        straddles and constructive receipt rules on their trading positions. They 
        are subject to these rules on their &#8220;segregated&#8221; investment 
        positions.<br>
        <br>
        Cash method traders electing MTM for the next tax year have excellent 
        opportunities for tax benefits. The flip side is tax pitfalls.<br>
        <br>
        Cash method traders first have a headache in dealing with the &#8220;capital-loss 
        limitation&#8221; rules at year end (discussed above).<br>
        <br>
        If that cash method trader also wants to elect mark-to-market accounting 
        for the following tax year, their level of tax planning complexity raises 
        a notch. When a cash basis trader elects MTM for the following tax year 
        there are many new tax planning opportunities as well as pitfalls. All 
        of these must be factored into the general tax planning for capital-loss 
        limitations.<br>
        <br>
        When a cash method trader makes a change in accounting method to MTM, 
        they are required to make a Section 481(a) adjustment on the first date 
        of the year of change. With MTM, the trader starts the year with all prior-year 
        open positions valued on opening prices the first trading day of the year. 
        The trader ended the prior year without having to report &#8220;unrealized&#8221; 
        gains and losses on open positions at year-end. Therefore, the Section 
        481(a) adjustment is meant to account for this disconnect. The Section 
        481(a) adjustment equals the prior year-end &#8220;unrealized&#8221; gains 
        or losses on trading positions only (not segregated investment positions).<br>
        <br>
        <strong>The gold in this article is a strategy to convert unutilized capital 
        losses into ordinary losses.</strong><br>
        A cash method trader who already exceeds the capital-loss limitation should 
        not sell additional losing positions before year-end (in December); instead, 
        that trader should try to hold those losing positions open until January 
        (using indices to hedge risk if necessary). <br>
        <br>
        The idea is that a carryover capital loss is not useful in the current 
        tax year and it may not be useful in the following tax year. By holding 
        the position open at year-end, the loss becomes a Section 481(a) adjustment, 
        which is a full ordinary loss deduction in the following tax year.<br>

        Negative Section 481(a) adjustments are reported in full in the year of 
        change. Positive Section 481(a) adjustments greater than $25,000 are prorated 
        over four years. <br>
        <br>
        It may even make sense to convert large unrealized gain positions to MTM 
        trading positions in the next tax year (with a MTM election) and then 
        prorate those gains over four tax years. </p>
      <p><span class="copybd"><b>Caution &#150; You are stuck with &quot;built-in&quot; 
        capital loss</b></span><b><br>
        </b>Please note that when a partner contributes an asset to a partnership 
        where the asset has a &quot;built-in&quot; capital loss in the hands of 
        the partner (i.e., the cost basis of the asset is more than the fair market 
        value at the date of the contribution to the partnership), the loss from 
        sale of the asset is still treated as a capital loss by the partnership 
        if the asset is sold within five years of the date it was contributed 
        to the partnership. This is true even if the partnership has trader status 
        and has properly elected MTM. Internal Revenue Code Section 724(c) specifically 
        prevents the conversion of &#8220;built-in&#8221; capital losses on security 
        transactions to ordinary losses by contributions from a cash basis trader/investor 
        to a trading entity that has properly elected MTM. This applies also to 
        a limited liability corporation (LLC), including a single-member LLC. 
        However, it does not apply to S-corporations<br>

        <strong>Joe Trader converts &#8220;unutilized&#8221; unrealized capital 
        losses from the current year into fully deductible ordinary losses in 
        the following year</strong>.<br>
        Joe Trader is a cash method (non-MTM) securities trader. On Dec. 1 of 
        the current tax year, Joe calculates current year-to-date net capital 
        losses in the amount of $25,000. On the same day, Joe also calculates 
        net &#8220;unrealized&#8221; trading losses on his open trading positions 
        in the amount of $50,000. As a cash method trader, he is limited to a 
        net capital loss deduction of $3,000 for the current tax year. <br>
        <br>
        Joe plans to elect MTM for the following year, by April 15, so his following 
        year trading gains and losses will be &#8220;ordinary&#8221; and not &#8220;capital.&#8221; 
        Joe is happy to avoid the prospect of increasing his already unutilized 
        capital loss carryovers.<br>
        <br>
        Joe does not have GTT TradeLog and he is not certain of his wash sales 
        and straddles. He figures he can skip this headache since he can&#8217;t 
        imagine that his deductible capital loss would end up being less than 
        his capital-loss limitation of $3,000.<br>
        <br>
        Joe should know that a wash-sale or straddle-loss deferral may be better 
        tax-wise than a capital-loss carryover, because he is electing MTM for 
        the following year. In most cases, wash-sale and straddle-loss deferrals 
        become part of a Section 481(a) ordinary loss adjustment. However, a capital-loss 
        carryover can never be recovered as an ordinary loss. Joe should calculate 
        his proper wash-sale and straddle-loss deferrals to take advantage of 
        this tax benefit.<br>
        <br>
        When thinking about his open positions in December, Joe figures his current 
        year-to-date capital losses already far surpass the $3,000 capital-loss 
        limitation, so why take more capital losses before year-end? They won&#8217;t 
        help lower his current year tax liability. <br>
        <br>
        Joe further figures that capital-loss carryovers are harder to utilize 
        in the following year because he will be generating ordinary rather than 
        capital gains from trading, and he will have few segregated investment 
        positions to generate capital gains. <br>
        <br>
        The smart move for Joe in December is to not sell his open positions and 
        instead try to hold them through year-end. If the market risk is too great, 
        Joe can hedge the open positions with indices. <br>
        By doing this, Joe will convert unutilized current year &#8220;unrealized&#8221; 
        capital-loss carryovers into a negative Section 481(a) adjustment that 
        is an ordinary loss in the following year.<br>
        <br>
        Joe killed two birds with one stone. He lowered his capital-loss carryover 
        and he also increased his ordinary tax loss in the following year.<br>
        <br>
        Joe can be even more clever by tax-loss selling before year-end on his 
        open unrealized gain positions. That will reduce his capital-loss carryover 
        and increase his Section 481(a) adjustments, respectively.<br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> If Joe had the reverse fact pattern and had unrealized capital 
        gains instead of unrealized capital losses, it would be imperative for 
        Joe to sell all those unrealized capital gains before year-end to offset 
        his $25,000 of realized capital losses to date.<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Business traders accelerate following-year expenses to lower current-year 
        tax liabilities</strong><br>
        The cardinal rule of year-end tax planning is to accelerate business deductions 
        and losses into the current tax year and defer income and gains into the 
        following tax year. <br>
        <br>
        The idea is to defer income taxes until the following tax years, thereby 
        benefiting from the use of this tax money during the current and following 
        tax year. These are referred to as &#8220;timing&#8221; rather than &#8220;permanent&#8221; 
        tax benefits.<br>
        <br>
        As a default method of accounting, business traders use the &#8220;cash 
        method&#8221; of accounting for both business expenses and trading gains 
        and losses. This means that business expenses are deductible when &#8220;paid&#8221;, 
        as opposed to when &#8220;incurred.&#8221; <br>
        <br>
        <b>Note:</b> When a business trader elects MTM, it only changes how gains 
        and losses are treated, not how &#8220;cash basis&#8221; expenses are 
        treated.<br>
        <br>
        For example, if a cash method business trader attends a seminar at year-end, 
        but pays the bill in January, it is a business expense for the following 
        year. <br>
        <br>
        A business trader may also elect to use the &#8220;accrual method&#8221; 
        of accounting, which means that expenses are deductible when incurred, 
        not when paid. <br>
        <br>
        A business trader may also elect to use MTM accounting for their trading 
        gains and losses. This MTM election must be filed with the IRS by April 
        15 of the current tax year; otherwise the cash method of &#8220;capital 
        gains and losses&#8221; applies for the entire tax year. See below for 
        tax planning moves related to trading gains and losses.<br>
        <br>
        Since trading gains and losses are treated separately from expenses and 
        business traders don&#8217;t have other forms of income, for most business 
        traders it may be better tax-wise to use the accrual method of accounting 
        for business expenses. This also may be more trouble accounting-wise. 
        <br>
        <br>
        For cash method business traders, the easiest way to accelerate deductions 
        is to pay all bills before year-end. Note, however, that a prepayment 
        of following-year expenses will not give rise to a current-year tax deduction.<br>
        <br>
        Credit card charges are treated like payments of cash or check. It does 
        not matter when you pay the credit card bill. For example, if you charge 
        your credit card for a new computer on Dec. 31, that is a current-year 
        tax deduction under the cash method. It does not matter that the computer 
        is listed on your January credit card statement. </p>
      <p><strong>Maximize your 100-percent depreciation for the current tax year</strong>.<br>
        If you plan to upgrade your computers, equipment and/or furniture/fixtures 
        soon, why not do it before year-end rather than in early 2003?<br>
        <br>
        Each tax year, a taxpayer is allowed IRC Section 179 depreciation (100 
        percent) up to the first $100,000 (increased from $24,000 for 2002) of 
        depreciable assets. Excess amounts are subject to the normal rules of 
        depreciation and amortization (over the useful life of the asset).</p>
      <p><strong> Figure out whether to pay the minimum or maximum state estimated 
        income taxes before year-end for a tax-savings deduction.</strong> <br>
        Self-employed taxpayers, like business traders, are responsible for paying 
        their own estimated income taxes during the current tax year. This is 
        more complex than it is for employees who have their federal and state 
        income tax withheld by their employers and reported on their W-2s.<br>
        <br>
        For most traders, if they wait until April 15 of the following year (the 
        tax deadline) to pay their current year federal and state income taxes, 
        they will be subject to federal and state &#8220;underestimated tax penalties.&#8221; 
        The current federal rate is 4 percent.<br>
        <br>
        In general, these rules work as follows: You may owe this penalty for 
        the current year if the total of your withholding and estimated tax payments 
        did not equal at least the smaller of 90 percent of your current year 
        tax liability, or 100 percent of your prior year tax liability (the &#8220;safe 
        harbor rule&#8221;). If your adjusted gross income (AGI) for the prior 
        year was more than $150,000 ($75,000 if your filing status is married 
        filing a separate return), substitute 110 percent for 100 percent above.<br>
      </p>
      <p>Some traders make a business decision to not pay estimated income tax 
        payments for their first three quarters in order to use that tax money 
        for additional trading capital. In the event they lose money in Q4 and 
        end the year with loses or lower gains, they can catch up with a Q4 estimated 
        tax payment. <br>
        <br>
        If they have trading gains in Q4, they are willing to pay the underestimated 
        tax penalties for Q1, Q2 and Q3, charged on a quarterly basis. They consider 
        this another form of a margin loan at 4-percent rates.<br>
        <br>
        The important tax planning question is whether to pay the minimum or maximum 
        state income tax payment by Dec. 31, or on the due date of Jan. 15 the 
        following year.<br>
        <br>
        Assume a trader&#8217;s current-year taxable income is significantly higher 
        than their prior year's taxable income. Using the safe harbor rule, this 
        trader can pay a good portion of their current-year income taxes by April 
        15 of the following year, thereby paying less with Q4 estimated income 
        tax payments.<br>
        <br>
        In many cases, it is tax beneficial for the above trader to pay their 
        entire current-year state tax due by Dec. 31 rather than the required 
        amount on Jan. 15 and the balance on April 15. A current-year itemized 
        deduction for state taxes will reduce the trader&#8217;s federal tax liability 
        at their highest federal marginal rates, up to 35 percent.<br>
        <br>
        A note of caution about alternative minimum tax (AMT): Make sure the Q4 
        estimated income tax payment does not give rise to an AMT, since state 
        income taxes are not a deduction for AMT taxable income. Only pay enough 
        state taxes before year-end until AMT is triggered. Pay the rest in the 
        following year (some may be owed by Q4 Jan. 15 and the rest by April 15).<br>
        <br>
        Another note of caution about forgoing estimated tax payments to increase 
        trading capital as long as possible: Many traders played this game for 
        tax year 1999 and lost what they owed by April 15, 2000. Many of them 
        are still in hot water with the IRS and state tax authorities. Every year 
        just before April 15, many traders must liquidate positions to raise capital 
        to pay taxes. Watch out for this annual musical chairs.</p>

        from a leading tax publisher:<br>
        | <br>
        2006 Year-End Tax Planning for Individuals</strong></p>
      <p>Dear Client:</p>
      <p>As 2006 draws to a close, there is still time to reduce your 2006 tax 
        bill and plan ahead for 2007. This letter highlights several potential 
        tax-saving opportunities for you to consider. I would be happy to meet 
        with you to discuss specific strategies.</p>
      <p>Basic Numbers You Need To Know</p>
      <p>Because many tax benefits are tied to or limited by adjusted gross income 
        (AGI)&#8212;IRA deductions, for example&#8212;a key aspect of tax planning 
        is to estimate both your 2006 and 2007 AGI. Also, when considering whether 
        to accelerate or defer income or deductions, you should be aware of the 
        impact this action may have on your AGI and your ability to maximize itemized 
        deductions that are tied to AGI. Your 2005 tax return and your 2006 pay 
        stubs and other income- and deduction-related materials are a good starting 
        point for estimating your AGI.</p>
      <p>Another important number is your &quot;tax bracket,&quot; i.e., the rate 
        at which your last dollar of income is taxed. The tax rates for 2006 are 
        10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, and 35%. Although tax brackets are indexed for 
        inflation, if your income increases faster than the inflation adjustment, 
        you may be pushed into a higher bracket. If so, your potential benefit 
        from any tax-saving opportunity is increased (as is the cost of overlooking 
        that opportunity).</p>
      <p>IRA, Retirement Savings Rules for 2006</p>
      <p>More tax-saving opportunities continue for retirement planning in 2006 
        than in previous years due to the availability of Roth IRAs, changes that 
        make regular IRAs more attractive, and other retirement savings incentives. 
        As discussed herein, even more changes will begin in 2007.</p>
      <p>Traditional IRAs: Individuals who are not active participants in an employer 
        pension plan may make deductible contributions to an IRA. The annual deductible 
        contribution limit for an IRA for 2006 is $4,000. Individuals who are 
        active participants in a plan may also make deductible contributions to 
        an IRA, but limited in amount depending on their AGI. For 2006, the AGI 
        phase-out range for deductibility of IRA contributions is between $50,000 
        and $60,000 of modified AGI for single persons (including heads of households), 
        and between $75,000 and $85,000 of modified AGI for married filing jointly. 
        Above these ranges, no deduction is allowed.</p>
      <p>For 2006, a $1,000 &quot;catch-up&quot; contribution deduction is allowed 
        for taxpayers age 50 or older by the close of the taxable year who meet 
        the other qualifications for IRA deductions. Thus, the total deductible 
        limit for these individuals may be as high as $5,000.</p>
      <p>In addition, an individual will not be considered an &quot;active participant&quot; 
        in an employer plan simply because the individual's spouse is an active 
        participant for part of a plan year. Thus, you may be able to take the 
        full deduction for an IRA contribution regardless of whether your spouse 
        is covered by a plan at work, subject to a phase-out if your joint modified 
        AGI is $150,000 to $160,000. Above this range, no deduction is allowed.</p>
      <p>Roth IRA: This type of IRA permits nondeductible contributions of up 
        to $4,000 a year. Earnings grow tax-free, and distributions are tax-free 
        provided no distributions are made until more than five years after the 
        first contribution and the individual has reached age 591/2. Distributions 
        may be made earlier on account of the individual's disability or death. 
        The maximum contribution is phased out for persons with AGI above certain 
        amounts: $150,000 to $160,000 for joint filers, and $95,000 to $110,000 
        for single filers (including heads of households). For 2006, a $1,000 
        &quot;catch-up&quot; contribution is allowed for taxpayers age 50 or older 
        by the close of the taxable year, making the total limit $5,000 for these 
        individuals.</p>
      <p>Roth IRA Conversion Rule: Funds in a traditional IRA may be rolled over 
        into a Roth IRA. Such a rollover, however, is treated as a taxable event, 
        and you will pay tax on the amount converted. No penalties will apply 
        if all the requirements for such a transfer are satisfied.</p>
      <p>A taxpayer's AGI (whether married filing jointly or single) is limited 
        to $100,000 to make such a conversion and the taxpayer must not be a married 
        individual filing a separate return.</p>
      <p>401(k) Contribution: The 401(k) elective deferral limit is $15,000 for 
        2006, up from $14,000 in 2005. If your 401(k) plan has been amended to 
        allow for catch-up contributions for 2006 and you will be 50 years old 
        by December 31, 2006, you may contribute an additional $5,000 to your 
        401(k) account, for a total maximum contribution of $20,000 ($15,000 in 
        regular contributions plus $5,000 in catch-up contributions).</p>
      <p>SIMPLE Plan Contribution: The SIMPLE plan deferral limit is $10,000 for 
        2006, the same as in 2005. If your SIMPLE plan has been amended to allow 
        for catch-up contributions for 2006 and you will be 50 years old by December 
        31, 2006, you may contribute an additional $2,500.</p>
      <p>Catch-Up Contributions for Other Plans: If you will be 50 years old by 
        December 31, 2006, you may also contribute an additional $5,000 to your 
        403(b) plan or SEP.</p>
      <p>Saver's Credit: A nonrefundable tax credit is available based on the 
        qualified retirement savings contributions to an employer plan made by 
        an eligible individual. Only taxpayers filing joint returns with AGI of 
        $50,000 or less, head of household returns with AGI of $37,500 or less, 
        or single returns (or separate returns filed by married taxpayers) with 
        AGI of $25,000 or less, are eligible for the credit. The amount of the 
        credit is equal to the applicable percentage (10% to 50%, based on filing 
        status and AGI) of qualified retirement savings contributions up to $2,000. 
      </p>
      <p>Maximize Retirement Savings: In many cases, employers will require you 
        to set your 2007 retirement contribution levels before January 2007. You 
        may want to increase your contribution to lower your AGI in order to take 
        advantage of some of the tax breaks described above. In addition, maximizing 
        your contribution is generally a good tax-saving move.</p>
      <p>Hurricane Relief: The 10% penalty on early distributions from qualified 
        retirement plans does not apply to qualified hurricane distributions of 
        up to $100,000 from a qualified retirement plan, a &sect;403(b) annuity, 
        or an IRA. A qualified hurricane distribution covers distributions taken 
        after Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma. A qualified Hurricane Katrina 
        distribution is any distribution from an eligible retirement plan made 
        on or after August 25, 2005, and before January 1, 2007, to an individual 
        whose principal place of abode on August 28, 2005, is located in the Hurricane 
        Katrina disaster area and who has sustained an economic loss by reason 
        of Hurricane Katrina. A qualified Hurricane Rita distribution is any distribution 
        from an eligible retirement plan made on or after September 23, 2005, 
        and before January 1, 2007, to an individual whose principal place of 
        abode on September 23, 2005, is located in the Hurricane Rita disaster 
        area and who has sustained an economic loss by reason of Hurricane Rita. 
        A qualified Hurricane Wilma distribution is any distribution from an eligible 
        retirement plan made on or after October 23, 2005, and before January 
        1, 2007, to an individual whose principal place of abode on October 23, 
        2005, is located in the Hurricane Wilma disaster area and who has sustained 
        an economic loss by reason of Hurricane Wilma. Distributions from someone 
        affected by multiple hurricanes cannot overlap. Withdrawals are ratably 
        included in income over a three-year period, unless the taxpayer elects 
        to include the amount in the current year. Withdrawals can be recontributed 
        to a qualified plan during such three-year period to avoid the withdrawal 
        being included in income. Any tax paid prior to the recontribution can 
        be recovered through refund procedures.</p>
      <p>Pension Act Relief: Effective for distributions made after 2006, nonspouse 
        beneficiaries may roll over to an IRA or other plan structured for that 
        purpose amounts inherited as a designated beneficiary. The inherited amounts 
        are subject to the annual minimum distribution rules requiring distributions 
        over the person's life expectancy (recalculated annually). Also, for taxable 
        years beginning after 2006, the IRS must make available a form for a taxpayer 
        to file with the IRS directing the IRS to send a refund directly to the 
        taxpayer's IRA. In addition, indexing the adjusted gross income levels 
        for the saver's credit (also made permanent) and IRAs will begin in taxable 
        years after 2006. Effective for distributions made after September 11, 
        2001, a reservist (called up between September 11, 2001, and before December 
        31, 2007, for more than 179 days) is excepted from the 10% premature distribution 
        tax for distributions before age 59 1/2 to a reservist, and allows the 
        money to be repaid within two years after the end of active service. Effective 
        for distributions made after August 17, 2006, public safety officers can 
        avoid the early 10% distribution penalty for distributions based on separation 
        from service if the officer is at least 50. Individuals who worked for 
        a bankrupt employer whose officers were indicted and whose employer had 
        at least a 50% match in the form of employer stock in its &sect;401(k) 
        plan can make an additional IRA catch-up contribution (three times the 
        otherwise applicable catch-up amount). The contributions can be made for 
        2007, 2008, and 2009. For tax years beginning after 2006, after-tax contributions 
        from qualified plans may be rolled over into defined benefit plans and 
        &sect;403(b) tax-sheltered annuities. Prior to the 2006 Pension Act, after-tax 
        contributions only could be rolled over into defined contribution plans 
        and IRAs.</p>
      <p>Deferring Income to 2007</p>
      <p>If you expect your AGI to be higher in 2006 than in 2007, or if you anticipate 
        being in the same or a higher tax bracket in 2006, you may benefit by 
        deferring income into 2007. Deferring income will be advantageous so long 
        as the deferral does not bump your income to the next bracket. Some ways 
        to defer income include:</p>
      <p>Delay Billing: If you are self-employed, delay year-end billing to clients 
        so that payments will not be received until 2007.</p>
      <p>Interest and Dividends: Interest income earned on Treasury securities 
        and bank certificates of deposit with maturities of one year or less is 
        not includible in income until received. To defer interest income, consider 
        buying short-term bonds or certificates that will not mature until next 
        year. If you have control as to when dividends are paid, arrange to have 
        them paid to you after the end of the year.</p>
      <p>Accelerating Income Into 2006</p>
      <p>In limited circumstances, you may benefit by accelerating income into 
        2006. For example, you may anticipate being in a higher tax bracket in 
        2007, or perhaps you will need additional income in order to take advantage 
        of an offsetting deduction or credit that will not be available to you 
        in future tax years. Note however that accelerating income into 2006 will 
        be disadvantageous if you expect to be in the same or lower tax bracket 
        for 2007. In any event, before you decide to implement this strategy, 
        we should &quot;crunch the numbers.&quot;</p>
      <p>If accelerating income will be beneficial, here are some ways to accomplish 
        this:</p>
      <p>Accelerate Collection of Accounts Receivable: If you are self-employed 
        and report income and expenses on a cash basis, issue bills and attempt 
        collection before the end of 2006. Also see if some of your clients or 
        customers might be willing to pay for January 2007 goods or services in 
        advance. Any income received using these steps will shift income from 
        2007 to 2006.</p>
      <p>Year-End Bonuses: If your employer generally pays year-end bonuses after 
        the end of the current year, ask to have your bonus paid to you before 
        the beginning of 2007.</p>
      <p>Retirement Plan Distributions: If you are over age 59 1/2 and you participate 
        in an employer retirement plan or have an IRA, consider making any taxable 
        withdrawals before 2007.</p>
      <p>You may also want to consider making a Roth IRA rollover distribution, 
        as discussed above.</p>
      <p>Special rules for taxpayers affected by the late 2005 hurricanes have 
        special distribution rules, even into 2006, discussed above.</p>
      <p>Deduction Planning</p>
      <p>Deduction timing is also an important element of year-end tax planning. 
        Deduction planning is complex, however, due to factors such as AGI levels 
        and filing status. If you are a cash-method taxpayer, remember to keep 
        the following in mind:</p>
      <p>Deduction In Year Paid: An expense is only deductible in the year in 
        which it is actually paid.</p>
      <p>Payment By Check: Date checks before the end of the year and mail them 
        before January 1, 2007.</p>
      <p>Promise To Pay: A promise to pay or providing a note does not permit 
        you to deduct the expense. But you can take a deduction if you pay with 
        money borrowed from a third party. Hence, if you pay by credit card in 
        2006, you can take the deduction even though you won't pay your credit 
        card bill until 2007.</p>
      <p>AGI Limits: The AGI limits on itemized deductions affect deduction planning. 
        Normally, overall itemized deductions are reduced by 3% of the AGI exceeding 
        $150,500 ($75,250 if married filing separately). However, for 2006, the 
        reduction is itself reduced to two-thirds of what it otherwise would be. 
        Similarly, certain deductions may be claimed only if they exceed a percentage 
        of AGI: 7.5% for medical expenses, 2% for miscellaneous itemized deductions, 
        and 10% for casualty losses.</p>
      <p>Standard Deduction Planning: Deduction planning is also affected by the 
        standard deduction. For 2006 returns, the standard deduction is $10,300 
        for married taxpayers filing jointly, $5,150 for single taxpayers, $7,550 
        for heads of households, and $5,150 for married taxpayers filing separately. 
        If your itemized deductions are relatively constant and are close to the 
        standard deduction amount, you will obtain little or no benefit from itemizing 
        your deductions each year. But simply taking the standard deduction each 
        year means you lose the benefit of your itemized deductions. To maximize 
        the benefits of both the standard deduction and itemized deductions, consider 
        adjusting the timing of your deductible expenses so that they are higher 
        in one year and lower in the following year.</p>
      <p>Medical Expenses: Medical expenses, including amounts paid as health 
        insurance premiums, are deductible only to the extent that they exceed 
        7.5% of AGI. Consider bunching medical expenses into years when your AGI 
        is lower.</p>
      <p>State Taxes: If you anticipate a state income tax liability for 2006 
        and plan to make an estimated payment, consider making the payment before 
        the end of 2006. </p>
      <p>Charitable Contributions: Consider making your charitable contributions 
        at the end of the year. This will give you use of the money during the 
        year and simultaneously permit you to claim a deduction for that year. 
        You can use a credit card to charge donations in 2006 even though you 
        will not pay the bill until 2007. A mere pledge to make a donation is 
        not deductible, however, unless it is paid by the end of the year. Note, 
        however, for claimed donations of cars, boats and airplanes of more than 
        $500, the amount available as a deduction will significantly depend on 
        what the charity does with the donated property, not just the fair market 
        value of the donated property. If the organization sells the property 
        without any significant intervening use or material improvement to the 
        property, the amount of the charitable contribution deduction cannot exceed 
        the gross proceeds received from the sale.</p>
      <p>To avoid capital gains, you may want to consider giving appreciated property 
        to charity.</p>
      <p>Hurricane Relief: Individual taxpayers may claim a $500 deduction against 
        taxable income for each &quot;Hurricane Katrina displaced individual&quot; 
        that the taxpayer houses for free in the taxpayer's principal residence 
        for a period of at least 60 days that ends in the taxable year. The deduction 
        is available in 2006. The aggregate total (including any amount claimed 
        in 2005) cannot exceed $2,000.</p>
      <p>Pension Act Relief: Individuals can exclude from gross income qualified 
        charitable distributions of up to $100,000 from a traditional individual 
        retirement account (IRA) or a Roth IRA, made to a tax-exempt organization 
        to which deductible contributions can be made. A qualified charitable 
        distribution is any distribution from an IRA that is made in a taxable 
        year beginning after December 31, 2005, and before January 1, 2008, directly 
        by the IRA trustee to an organization described in &sect;170(c). Direct 
        distributions are eligible for the exclusion only if made on or after 
        the date the IRA owner attains age 70 1/2. A distribution is treated as 
        a qualified charitable distribution only to the extent that the distribution 
        is includible in gross income. The exclusion does not apply to direct 
        distributions only if a charitable contribution deduction for the entire 
        distribution otherwise is allowable under &sect;170. Effective for contributions 
        made after August 17, 2006, the following special rules are in effect: 
        (1) no deduction is allowed for charitable contributions of clothing and 
        household items if such items are not in good used condition or better; 
        (2) the IRS may deny a deduction for any item with minimal monetary value; 
        (3) these restrictions do not apply to the contribution of any single 
        clothing or household item for which a deduction of $500 or more is claimed 
        if the taxpayer includes a qualified appraisal with his or her return; 
        (4) in the case of a charitable contribution of money, regardless of the 
        amount, a deduction is denied, unless the donor maintained a cancelled 
        check, bank record, or receipt from the donee organization showing the 
        name of the donee organization, the date of the contribution, and the 
        amount of the contribution. </p>
      <p>Business Deductions</p>
      <p>Self-Employed Health Insurance Premiums: Self-employed individuals are 
        allowed to claim 100% of the amount paid during the taxable year for insurance 
        that constitutes medical care for themselves, their spouses and dependents 
        as an above-the-line deduction, without regard to the 7.5% of AGI floor.</p>
      <p>Equipment Purchases: If you are in business and purchase equipment, you 
        may make a &quot;Section 179 Election,&quot; which allows you to expense 
        (i.e., currently deduct) otherwise depreciable business property. In general, 
        you may elect to expense up to $108,000 of equipment costs (with a phase-out 
        for purchases in excess of $430,000) if the asset was placed in service 
        during 2006. In addition, careful timing of equipment purchases can result 
        in favorable depreciation deductions in 2006. In general, under the &quot;half-year 
        convention,&quot; you may deduct six months worth of depreciation for 
        equipment that is placed in service on or before the last day of the tax 
        year. (If more than 40% of the cost of all personal property placed in 
        service occurs during the last quarter of the year, however, a &quot;mid-quarter 
        convention&quot; applies, which lowers your depreciation deduction.) A 
        popular strategy in recent years is to purchase a vehicle (usually an 
        SUV) for business purposes that exceeds the depreciation limits set by 
        statute (i.e., a vehicle rated over 6,000 pounds). Doing so would not 
        subject the purchase to the statutory dollar limit, $2,960 for 2006; $3,260 
        in the case of vans and trucks. Therefore, the vehicle would qualify for 
        the full equipment expensing dollar amount. However, for SUVs (rated between 
        6,000 and 14,000 pounds gross vehicle weight) placed in service in 2006, 
        the expensing amount is limited to $25,000. Hurricane Relief: Taxpayers 
        can deduct the lesser of $100,000 or the cost of qualified Gulf Opportunity 
        Zone property, in addition to the existing $108,000 amount for 2006. In 
        general, the property must be originally used by the taxpayer on or after 
        August 28, 2005, and placed in service before January 1, 2007 (January 
        1, 2008, for nonresidential real property and residential rental property). 
        The phase-out amount is also increased by the lesser of $600,000 or the 
        costs of qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone property placed in service during 
        the year.</p>
      <p>NOL Carryback Period: If your business suffers net operating losses in 
        2006, you may apply those losses against taxable income going back two 
        tax years. Thus, for example, the loss could be used to reduce taxable 
        income&#8212;and thus generate tax refunds&#8212;for tax years as far 
        back as 2004. Hurricane Relief: The NOL carryback period is five years 
        for any qualified Gulf Opportunity Zone loss.</p>
      <p>Bonus Depreciation: Taxpayers meeting certain criteria can claim a 50% 
        bonus depreciation allowance for Gulf Opportunity Zone business property 
        that is placed in service before 2008 (before 2009, for nonresidential 
        real and residential rental property) and exempts such depreciation allowances 
        from the alternative minimum tax. The original use of the property in 
        the GO Zone must begin with the taxpayer on or after August 28, 2005. 
      </p>
      <p>Education and Child Tax Benefits</p>
      <p>Child Tax Credit: A tax credit of $1,000 per qualifying child under the 
        age of 17 is available on this year's return. The credit is phased out 
        at a rate of $50 for each $1,000 (or fraction of $1,000) of modified AGI 
        exceeding the following amounts: $110,000 for married filing jointly; 
        $55,000 for married filing separately; and $75,000 for all other taxpayers. 
        A portion of the credit may be refundable. </p>
      <p>Credit for Adoption Expenses: For 2006, the adoption credit limitation 
        is $10,960 of aggregate expenditures for each child, except that the credit 
        for an adoption of a child with special needs is deemed to be $10,960 
        regardless of the amount of expenses. The credit ratably phases out for 
        taxpayers whose income is between $164,410 and $204,410.</p>
      <p>HOPE Credit and Lifetime Learning Credit: The maximum HOPE credit is 
        $1,650 (100% on the first $1,100, plus 50% of the next $1,100) for qualified 
        tuition and fees paid on behalf of a student (i.e., the taxpayer, the 
        taxpayer's spouse, or a dependent) who is enrolled on at least a half-time 
        basis. The credit is available for only the first two years of the student's 
        post-secondary education. Hurricane Relief: For individuals attending 
        qualified education institutions in the Gulf Opportunity Zone in a taxable 
        year beginning in 2006, the eligible expenditures qualifying is expanded 
        to include books, supplies and equipment. In addition, the $1,100 amounts 
        for 2006 are doubled.</p>
      <p>The Lifetime Learning credit maximum in 2006 is $2,000 (20% of qualified 
        tuition and fees up to $10,000). A student need not be enrolled on at 
        least a half-time basis so long as he or she is taking post-secondary 
        classes to acquire or improve job skills. As with the HOPE credit, eligible 
        students include the taxpayer, the taxpayer's spouse, or a dependent. 
        Hurricane Relief: The Lifetime Learning credit percentage is increased 
        to 40% for individuals attending qualified education institutions in the 
        Gulf Opportunity Zone in a taxable year beginning in 2006.</p>
      <p>For 2006, both the HOPE credit and the Lifetime Learning credit are phased 
        out at modified AGI levels between $90,000 and $110,000 for joint filers, 
        and between $45,000 and $55,000 for single taxpayers.</p>
      <p>Coverdell Education Savings Account: Beginning in 2006, the aggregate 
        annual contribution limit to a Coverdell education savings account is 
        $2,000 per designated beneficiary of the account. This limit is phased 
        out for individual contributors with modified AGI between $95,000 and 
        $110,000 and joint filers with modified AGI between $190,000 and $220,000. 
        The contributions to the account are nondeductible but the earnings grow 
        tax-free.</p>
      <p>Student Loan Interest: You may be eligible for an above-the-line deduction 
        for student loan interest paid on any &quot;qualified education loan.&quot; 
        The maximum deduction is $2,500. The deduction for 2006 is phased out 
        at a modified AGI level between $105,000 and $135,000 for joint filers, 
        and between $50,000 and $65,000 for individual taxpayers.</p>
      <p>Rules are in effect to coordinate education provisions, such as the qualified 
        higher education expense deduction, the Hope and Lifetime Learning credits, 
        Coverdell education savings accounts, and qualified tuition plans, to 
        prevent double benefits.</p>
      <p>Energy Incentives</p>
      <p>Alternative Motor Vehicle Credit: Available for the first time in 2006, 
        a credit is available for purchases of motor vehicles powered by certain 
        alternative fuels. A credit, the dollar amount depending on fuel savings 
        and weight of the vehicle, is available for vehicles placed in service 
        on or after January 1, 2006. The most popular vehicles subject to the 
        credit are hybrids. However, when a particular manufacturer sells in the 
        United States its 60,000th of the particular hybrid, a phaseout period 
        kicks in. The phaseout will reduce the credit from fully available to 
        nothing being available. The phaseout begins in the second calendar quarter 
        following the calendar quarter where the manufacturer sold its 60,000th 
        hybrid vehicle following December 31, 2005. Credits are also available 
        for lean-burn technology vehicles (subject to the same phaseout), qualified 
        fuel cell motor vehicles, and qualified alternative fuel motor vehicles.</p>
      <p>Residential Energy Efficient Property Credit: Tax incentives are available 
        to taxpayers who install certain energy efficient property, such as photovoltaic, 
        solar water heating or fuel cell property. In 2006, a credit is available 
        for the expenditures incurred for such property up to a specific dollar 
        limitation. The property purchased cannot be used to heat swimming pools 
        or hot tubs. The credit is set to expire for property placed in service 
        after 2007.</p>
      <p>Nonbusiness Energy Property Credit: Tax incentives are available to taxpayers 
        who remodel their home and/or incorporate specific energy efficient property. 
        Beginning in 2006, a credit is allowed for the purchase of qualified energy 
        efficiency improvements. Such property includes advanced main air circulating 
        fans, natural gas, propane, oil furnace or hot water boiler, windows, 
        insulation material, exterior doors, etc. that meet certain energy efficiency 
        standards. The credit is capped in dollar amounts per item of property. 
        The credit is set to expire for property placed in service after 2007.</p>
      <p>Business Credits</p>
      <p>Small Employer Pension Plan Startup Cost Credit: For 2006, certain small 
        business employers that did not have a pension plan for the preceding 
        three years may claim a nonrefundable income tax credit for expenses of 
        establishing and administering a new retirement plan for employees. The 
        credit applies to 50% of the first $1,000 in qualified administrative 
        and retirement-education expenses for each of the first three plan years.</p>
      <p>Employer-Provided Child Care Credit: For 2006, employers may claim a 
        credit of up to $150,000 for supporting employee childcare or childcare 
        resource and referral services. The credit is allowed for a percentage 
        of &quot;qualified child care expenditures&quot; including for property 
        to be used as part of a qualified child care facility, for operating costs 
        of a qualified child care facility and for resource and referral expenditures.</p>
      <p>Investment Planning</p>
      <p>The following rules apply for most capital assets in 2006:</p>
      <p>&#8226; Capital gains on property held one year or less are taxed at 
        an individual's ordinary income tax rate.</p>
      <p>&#8226; Capital gains on property held for more than one year are taxed 
        at a maximum rate of 15% (5% if an individual is in the 10% or 15% marginal 
        tax bracket).</p>
      <p>Timing of Sales: You may want to time the sale of assets so as to have 
        offsetting capital losses and gains. Capital losses may be fully deducted 
        against capital gains and also may offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income 
        ($1,500 for married filing separately). In general, when you take losses, 
        you must first match your long-term losses against your long-term gains, 
        and short-term losses against short-term gains. If there are any remaining 
        losses, you may use them to offset any remaining long-term or short-term 
        gains, or up to $3,000 (or $1,500) of ordinary income. When and whether 
        to recognize such losses should be analyzed in light of the changes in 
        the capital gains rates applicable to your specific investments.</p>
      <p>Dividends: Qualifying dividends received in 2006 are subject to rates 
        similar to the capital gains rates. Therefore, qualifying dividends are 
        taxed at a maximum rate of 15%. Qualifying dividends includes dividends 
        received from domestic and certain foreign corporations.</p>
      <p>Social Security</p>
      <p>Depending on the recipient's modified AGI and the amount of Social Security 
        benefits, a percentage&#8212;up to 85%&#8212;of Social Security benefits 
        may be taxed. To reduce that percentage, it may be beneficial to defer 
        receipt of other retirement income. One way to do so is to elect to receive 
        a lump sum distribution from a retirement plan and to rollover that distribution 
        into an IRA. Alternatively, it may be beneficial to accelerate income 
        so as to reduce the percentage of your Social Security taxed in 2007 and 
        later years.</p>
      <p>Other Tax Planning Opportunities</p>
      <p>We also can discuss the potential benefits to you or your family members 
        of other planning options available for 2006, including &sect;529 qualified 
        tuition programs, which were made permanent by legislation enacted in 
        2006.</p>
      <p>Alternative Minimum Tax</p>
      <p>In 2006, the alternative minimum tax exemption amounts are: (1) $62,550 
        for married individuals filing jointly and for surviving spouses; (2) 
        $42,500 for unmarried individuals other than surviving spouses; and (3) 
        $31,275 for married individuals filing a separate return. Also, nonrefundable 
        personal credits can offset an individual's regular and alternative minimum 
        tax. </p>
      <p>Some of the standard year-end planning ideas will not reduce tax liability 
        if you are subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT) because different 
        rules apply. Because of the complexity of the AMT, it would be wise for 
        us to analyze your AMT exposure.</p>
      <p>If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call. I would be 
        happy to meet with you at your convenience to discuss the strategies outlined 
        above. There is still time to implement these strategies to minimize your 
        2006 tax liability.</p>
      <p>Very truly yours,</p>
      <p></p>
