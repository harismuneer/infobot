<FONT SIZE=5><B>Introduction to <I>Zheyin Shizi Qinpu</I></B></FONT>
<BR><FONT SIZE=4><B>Qin Handbook of Music of the Zhe(jiang School) 
Elucidated through Lyrics</B></FONT><A NAME="r1" HREF="#f1"><B><SUP>1</SUP></B></A>

<P>The second major surviving handbook, <I>Zheyin Shizi Qinpu</I> (hereafter <I>Zheyin</I>) has been attributed to Zhu Quan's grandson and heir, Zhu Dianpei<A NAME="r2" HREF="#f2"><B><SUP>2</SUP></B></A> (1418-91). The surviving copy, now apparently lost but fortunately first reproduced in <I>Qinqu Jicheng</I>, has two folios. The book originally had 34 pieces and eight modal introductions; all have lyrics (<I>SQMP</I> had none). 19 or 20 of the pieces (one is missing) and all surviving modal introductions (one is missing) are identical with the versions in <I>SQMP</I>. Of the 14 additional melodies, five are different versions of <I>SQMP</I> pieces, nine are new titles.

<P>In contrast to <I>SQMP</I>, very little has been published concerning 
<I>Zheyin</I> or Zhu Dianpei: I have found only the brief introduction 
Zha Fuxi wrote in <I>Cunjian Guqin Qupu Jilan</I>;<A NAME="r3" HREF="#f3"><B><SUP>3</SUP></B></A> his slightly different and longer version in Volume I of the first edition of <I>Qinqu Jicheng</I>; and a verbatim reproduction of the latter in Volume I of the <I>Qinqu Jicheng</I> new series. Zha makes reference to the official Ming History, which mentions Zhu Dianpei in its biography of Princes of Ning.

<P>Furthermore, the only other reconstruction I can find of any of the 14 additional melodies found therein is the one  by Wang Di of <A HREF="zy13ygsd.htm"><I>Yangguan Sandie</I></A>;<A NAME="r4" HREF="#f4"><B><SUP>4</SUP></B></A> it does not include the tablature and there is no recording. The recording and corresponding transcriptions from <I>Zheyin Shizi Qinpu</I> (published with the title <A HREF="../../01mywk/00pub.htm">Music Beyond Sound</A>) include all it pieces with new music (except the fragmentary <I>Qiao Ge</I>). Hopefully it will be of some interest to the qin world and those interested in ancient music.

<P>According to the prefaces by Zha Fuxi the only known surviving copy of <I>Zheyin</I> was found in the ancient <I>Tian Yi Ge</I>,<A NAME="r5" HREF="#f5"><B><SUP>5</SUP></B></A> book collection belonging to the Fan family in Ningbo, east of Hangzhou. The <I>Tian Yi Ge Book Catalogue</I> mistakenly calls it the Emaciated Immortal's <I> Shen Qi Mi Pu</I> (Zhu Quan called himself Qu Xian, the Emaciated Immortal), perhaps because of the great number of identical melodies.

<P><A NAME="compiler"><B>Was Zhu Dianpei actually the compiler?</B>

<P>In 1448 Zhu Dianpei (1418 - 1491) succeeded his grandfather 
<A HREF="../07sqmp/07zqbio.htm">Zhu Quan</A> as prince of Nanchang. Zhu Quan, 17th son of the founder of the Ming dynasty and the first prince of Ning, had been  originally enfeoffed at Daning,<A NAME="r6" HREF="#f6"><B><SUP>6</SUP></B></A> north of the Great Wall, but in 1403 was effectively banished to Nanchang, where he participated in numerous artistic and scientific endeavors until his death in 1448. His first son Zhu Panshi<A NAME="r7" HREF="#f7"><B><SUP>7</SUP></B></A> died in 1437, so Panshi's first son Zhu Dianpei became heir apparent then, in 1448, succeeded with the title Peaceful Prince.<A NAME="r8" HREF="#f8"><B><SUP>8</SUP></B></A> Zhu Dianpei died in 1491. The official <I>Ming History</I> says he was an accomplished writer, author of a one-volume Poetry Criticism</I>.<A NAME="r9" HREF="#f9"><B><SUP>9</SUP></B></A> The only other information it has about him concerns accusations made by his younger brother in 1456; Zhu Dianpei was found guilty, but pardoned.

<P>Because the first folio of <I>Zheyin Shizi Qinpu</I> is missing the first four pages, we have no title page or preface, so there remain a number of mysteries about this handbook. The main one is: who was the Xi Xian<A NAME="r10" HREF="#f10"><B><SUP>10</SUP></B></A> (Beyond-Sounds Immortal) who wrote prefaces and presumably compiled the collection? How reliable are the assertions that Xi Xian was another name for Zhu Dianpei?

<P><A NAME="gongjing">The second folio, after giving the title, &quot;<I>Zheyin Shizi Qinpu</I>, Final Folio&quot;, says &quot;Edited and interpreted by Antiquarian Gong Jing of the Banze district of Nanchang, a Confucian devotee.&quot;<A NAME="r11" HREF="#f11"><B><SUP>11</SUP></B></A> Nanchang, now capital city of Jiangxi province in central China, is the city where Zhu Quan and his royal descendants lived. The only biographical information available about Gong Jing is a comment in <I>Chongxiu Zhenchuan Qinpu</I> (1585; see <A HREF="#cxzcqp">below</A>) that he assisted Xi Xian.

<P>All the pieces have introductions beginning &quot;Xi Xian says&quot;. This Xi Xian refers to Zhu Quan as his "royal ancestor",<A NAME="r8" HREF="#f8"><B><SUP>8</SUP></B></A> and it is mainly because of this and the added lyrics that Chinese sources say Xi Xian was Zhu Dianpei, grandson of Zhu Quan, and his successor in Nanchang.

<P><A NAME="cxzcqp">One other source of information about <I>Zheyin</I> is the 
<A HREF="../24cxzc.htm"><I>Chongxiu Zhenchuan Qinpu</I></A> (hereafter <I>CXZCQP</I>), published in 1585 by Yang Biaozheng of Yongan, in the Yanping  district of central Fujian province. <I>CXZCQP</I> has 105 pieces, all also having lyrics. Although the lyrics are almost exactly the same for the 37 pieces in <I>Zheyin</I> also found in <I>CXZCQP</I>, the music is all quite different. Neither book mentions the source of its lyrics. The melodies in the latter book seem more clearly intended for singing.

<P>With regard to this, in a preface to <I>CXZCQP</I> one Liu Yu<A NAME="r13" HREF="#f13"><B><SUP>13</SUP></B></A> wrote,

<DIR>In the past Xi Xian, our prince of Jiangfan,<A NAME="r14" HREF="#f14"><B><SUP>14</SUP></B></A> helped by Antiquarian Gong, at that time edited <I>Taiyin Shizi</I>.<A NAME="r15" HREF="#f15"><B><SUP>15</SUP></B></A> However, from the way they wrote it seems that they were obscuring things. Now, though, (Yang Biaozheng) of Yongan has bestowed (<I>CXZCQP</I>) on later generations, clarifying all the secrets....</DIR>

<P><I>CXZCQP</I> also, in a section called Listing of Sages (withconnections to the qin), mentions the names Zhu Quan, Xi Xian and Antiquarian gong. It adds that Xi Xian wrote the melodies 
<I>Siqi Xing</I><A NAME="r16" HREF="#f16"><B><SUP>16</SUP></B></A> and 
<I>Jixu Yin</I><A NAME="r17" HREF="#f17"><B><SUP>17</SUP></B></A> (neither is in any known handbooks), and that Antiquarian Gong wrote 
<I>Xi Xian Cao</I>,<A NAME="r18" HREF="#f18"><B><SUP>18</SUP></B></A> 
<I>Tanshi Cao</I><A NAME="r19" HREF="#f19"><B><SUP>19</SUP></B></A> and 
<I>Wangdao Song</I><A NAME="r20" HREF="#f20"><B><SUP>20</SUP></B></A> (also not in any known handbooks).

<P>My own inclination from this is to suspect that <I>Taiyin Shizi</I> was the complete work, perhaps better made, perhaps only hand-copied, and the <I>Zheyin</I> which has survived is a badly done copy of the second half of <I>Taiyin Shizi</I>. However, I know of no way at present to corroborate such a conjecture.

<P>As for <I>CXZCQP</I> &quot;clarifying all the secrets&quot;, I find its music even more problematic than <I>Zheyin</I>. Perhaps this mainly shows I am unfamiliar with its style. However, I know of no published recordings of music reconstructed from <I>CXZCQP</I>.

<P><B>Errors</B>

<P>See the Sample Page of <I>Zheyin Shizi Qinpu</I> either in the original handbook or in my collection of transcriptions, <A HREF="../../01mywk/09bk.htm"><I>Music Beyond Sound, the Book</I></A>, in order to get a better idea of the errors which are to be found in this book.

<P>If Xi Xian, a prince, compiled the book, why is it that <I>Zheyin</I> is so badly printed and contains so many errors? &quot;Errors&quot; can be of two basic kinds - hidden and obvious. Since the finger positions and movements were generally describing how a particular person played a melody, the transcriber, or copyist, might get that wrong, but the results could still be playable, so the mistake is hidden. Or if a piece is being copied from an old book into 
a new one there is again a chance for both hidden errors (or re-interpretations, or corrections) as well as obvious ones - where what is written is unplayable. For example, if the tablature says to slide up from the 8th to the 9th position there must be a mistake, because from 8th to 9th is down, not up.

<P><I>SQMP</I> has very few such obvious mistakes, <I>Zheyin</I> has many. <I>SQMP</I> has virtually no unclear characters/figures; <I>Zheyin</I> has many. On this basis one can surmise that <I>Zheyin</I> also has more hidden errors. However, one must also keep in mind the possibility that the <I>SQMP</I> texts originally had an equal number of errors and that in some cases Zhu Quan (or someone else) made corrections based on misinterpreting the original player's intentions, making the work represent the later performer rather than the earlier.

<P><B>Sources of the music</B>

<P>Zhu Quan wrote that he collected the music in <I>SQMP</I> from various sources; most are thought to be Song dynasty or earlier. What are the sources of the additional music in <I>Zheyin</I> and, being published later, do these represent a later tradition?

<P>There are enough similar characteristics within these additional pieces to suggest they represent a particular style. This is also very similar to much of the <I>SQMP</I> style, but to me they also feel slightly different, though I cannot say why. Could it be my own style changing, or the fact that tablature unclarity or errors required me to do more guesswork? Or could the pieces 
represent some later evolution, such as early Ming developments of the famous Zhe school in relatively remote Nanchang?<A NAME="r21" HREF="#f21"><B><SUP>21</SUP></B></A> Is this why later versions of pieces first surviving in <I>Zheyin</I> can always be more closely affiliated to versions in other handbooks than to the ones in <I>Zheyin</I>?

<P>On the other hand, one might also speculate that, of course, Zhu Quan and his group collected more pieces, including alternate versions, than were eventually published in <I>SQMP</I>. Perhaps this is the source of the <I>Zheyin</I> additions, omitted from the earlier book because of the mistakes in the tablature or even a rejection of the style.

<P>The title of <I>Zheyin</I> would seem to indicate the music is representative of the music of the Zhe school of qin play. This style, which flourished during a period dating at least from the late Song to early Ming dynasties (12th to 15th centuries AD), is similar enough to that of many <I>SQMP</I> melodies that one might assume the pieces in both handbooks come from the same school.

<P>On the other hand, the Zhe school is said to have emphasized fluidity of melodies, as opposed to the Jiang school, which emphasized lyrics, saying qin music should always be accompanied by song. It is somewhat odd, then, that this Zhe-school handbook has lyrics. Perhaps the person who named the collection wanted to show that lyrics could be applied to music of the Zhe school as well.

<P>It might also be mentioned that Zhu Quan, before being sent to Nanchang, had requested transfer to Suzhou or nearby Hangzhou in Zhejiang province. There may be a connection between his interest in that area and his handbook including music from there. There should be some significance to the fact that <I>Zheyin</I> was compiled in Nanchang over 50 years later but its music seems to come from an apparently similar source as that of <I>SQMP</I>.

<P><A NAME="complete"><B>How complete is the surviving edition of <I>Zheyin Shizi Qinpu</I>?</B>

<P>As mentioned above, the only known copy of <I>Zheyin</I> had two folios. The first folio had 66 (double) pages, but is missing 1 to 4 and 15 to 21. The last folio has pages 67 to 143, but ends during a piece. It contains 32 named pieces (four fragmentary) and eight modal introductions.<A NAME="r22" HREF="#f22"><B><SUP>22</SUP></B></A> 

<P>Revising this figure to 34 pieces and eight modal introductions is based on filling in what was most likely in these missing pages. Pages 1 to 4 almost certainly included the two missing pieces from <I>SQMP</I> in the <I>jiao</I> mode (<A HREF="../07sqmp/sq33spjy.htm"><I>Jiao Yi</I></A> and 
<A HREF="../07sqmp/sq34lxy.htm"><I>Lingxu Yin</I></A>, as well as the first part of <A HREF="../07sqmp/sq35lzyf.htm"><I>Liezi Yufeng</I></A>) -- the space is exactly right, assuming these pieces had the same length as they did in <I>SQMP</I>. The space available in the missing pages 15 to 21 is also such as to support an assumption that it included only the latter part of 
<A HREF="zy03tty.htm"><I>Tiantai Yin</I></A> and the first part of 
<A HREF="../07sqmp/sq40qg.htm"><I>Qiao Ge</I></A>.

<P>Pieces in <I>jiao</I>, <I>zhi</I>, <I>yu</I> and <I>shangjiao</I> modes use <A HREF="../../08anal/mode.htm">standard tuning</A>; those in <I>ruibin</I>, <I>guxian</I>, <I>huangzhong</I> and <I>qiliang</I> modes use various non-standard tunings. In addition to the surviving (jiao is missing) modal introductions, all 16 pieces using non-standard tunings which are also in <I>SQMP</I> have tablature identical to that in <I>SQMP</I>. Of the nine using standard tuning which are also in <I>SQMP</I>, five are quite different (one is fragmentary); one is missing; and the other three are identical to <I>SQMP</I> (including the opening, fragmentary piece, and the two in shangjiao mode, which for some reason both <I>SQMP</I> and <I>Zheyin</I> place, almost hidden, amongst pieces having non-standard tuning).

<P>Were there originally more pieces in <I>Zheyin</I>? It has no pieces using <I>gong</I>, <I>shang</I>, <I>man gong</I>, <I>man shang</I> or <I>man jiao</I> modes. These five modes contain almost half of the pieces in <I>SQMP</I> and would naturally have been at the beginning of <I>Zheyin</I>. Probably for this reason Zha Fuxi (1958) questions whether the surviving first folio of Zheyin is in fact the middle folio. Yet <I>Zheyin</I>'s two folios are numbered consecutively beginning on page one of the first folio.

<P><A NAME="pairing">Pairing the lyrics of a later melody with the fingering of the version in <I>Shen Qi Mi Pu</I> provides another way to try to determine whether certain melodies might originally have been included in the original <I>Zheyin Shizi Qinpu</I>. Almost all <I>qin</I> melodies with lyrics use a standard pairing method, assigning one character for each right hand and certain left hand strokes (this formula might be compared to the formula for writing <A HREF="../../05poet/qinci.htm"><I>ci</I></A> lyrics: both can be done without knowing the actual melody). Examination shows that the lyrics of several pieces in <A HREF="../24cxzc.htm"><I>Chongxiu Zhenchuan Qinpu</I></A> (CXZCQP; particulary in <A HREF="../24cxzc/cx00toc.htm#folio9">Folio 9</A>) can be applied to the music of several further pieces in <I>SQMP</I>, in spite of the actual music being very different.<A NAME="r23" HREF="#f23"><B><SUP>23</SUP></B></A> With some pieces it is difficult to test this assertion. For example, the lyrics from the <A HREF="../24cxzc/cx00toc.htm#p71"><I>Dunshi Cao</I></A> in <I>CXZCQP</I> can be made to fit the notes of the <A HREF="../07sqmp/sq01dsc.htm"><I>SQMP</I></A> version; it is a bit tricky, but perhaps no more so than with some of the other Folio I pieces, with their rather complex tablature. 

<P>The potential pairing of lyrics with the music in <I>SQMP</I> is done by comparing the number of &quot;word spaces&quot; (right hand and certain left hand strokes) in a section of a <I>SQMP</I> piece with the number of characters that make up the lyrics in the same section of a <I>CXZCQP</I> piece. In reality this is not quite so straightforward as it may sound. For example, one has to decide whether to ignore the filler characters in the lyrics (e.g. &quot;<I>na</I>&quot; [&quot;that&quot;], &quot;<I>ni'na</I>&quot; [&quot;you'that&quot;] or &quot;<I>de'na</I>&quot; [of'that]), and then not count in the tablature the left hand stroke techniques like <I>duiqi</I>, which are usually paired with these meaningless syllables; or to try strictly to match them. The tablature itself is not always strict about this, so there is some leeway.

<P>Besides <I>Dunshi Cao</I>, other pieces to examine in this regard include 
<A HREF="../07sqmp/sq09zy.htm"><I>Zhao Yin</I></A>, 
<A HREF="../07sqmp/sq11hl.htm"><I>Huo Lin</I></A>, 
<A HREF="../07sqmp/sq18ghy.htm"><I>Guanghan You</I></A>, and 
<A HREF="../07sqmp/sq23wj.htm"><I>Wang Ji</I></A>. It will be observed, for 
example, that according to the principles described in the previous 
paragraph the comparison is as follows for Section 1 of <I>Guanghan 
You</I>:

<DIR><I>CXZCQP</I>:<I> </I> 109 characters, phrased as follows: 4,4.
5,5. 3,3,3+8,4,6. 6,6. 7,4. 6,6. 3,8. 4,6. 8.

<P><I>SQMP</I>: 109 &quot;word spaces&quot;, phrased as follows: 
4, 4, 7, 9, 10, 10, 9, 4, 13, 11, 3, 13, 4, 4, 4 </DIR>

<P>This, plus the above-mentioned fact that the 37 pieces in both <I>Zheyin</I> and <I>CXZCQP</I> have the same lyrics, might be considered further evidence that there was once a more complete edition of <I>Zheyin</I> which included at least these particular pieces.

<P>Once again, this perhaps supports the argument that someone acquired part of a good quality handbook from the court (or if the original was only a manuscript, perhaps it was not such good quality) and had it printed himself, but was not capable of editing or proof-reading it properly (the printers would not have understood the qin tablature). If so, this could explain the missing pieces which should have begun the book.

<P><A NAME="qinge"><B>Are they <I>qin'ge</I> (qin songs)?</B>

<P>If the Zhe school emphasized fluidity of melodies, as opposed to the 
Jiang school, which emphasized lyrics, why does this supposedly Zhe-school handbook have lyrics? Does the <A HREF="#pairing">pairing</A> of melody and lyrics suggest or even allow singing them?

<P>Perhaps at one time some people believed that the melodies with lyrics, because they were simpler, must have been older. There is insufficient evidence in general to support such a belief, and the example of the complex music of <I>Zheyin</I> having lyrics might also seem to refute it - unless the lyrics were added for philosophical reasons rather than to make actual <I>qin</I> song.

<P><I>CXZCQP</I> is said to be representative of the Jiang school, which encouraged <I>qin</I> songs, and it is clear that most of its lyrics were intended to be sung. The pieces in <I>Zheyin</I>, in spite of their largely identical lyrics, do not so clearly have this intention. The following transcriptions of music for the same two phrases of lyrics from each of these handbooks show the difference clearly. 

<P>Unfortunately, little has been written about how actually to sing the lyrics that can be found in <I>qin</I> handbooks. One can assume that octave leaps would be evened out in the voice. There is no indication of whether the lyrics are to be repeated when the melody is repeated, as it is in the second line of the first example below.

<P>Opening of <A HREF="../07sqmp/sq15xhj.htm"><I>Xiao Hujia</I></A> in <I>Zheyin Shizi Qinpu</I> (1491; punctuation is from <I>SQMP</I> tablature)

<P><IMG SRC="images/1491xhjw.jpg" ALIGN=CENTER BORDER=1 WIDTH=800 HEIGHT=256> 

<P ALIGN="LEFT">Opening of <I>Xiao Hujia</I> in <I>Chongxiu Zhenchuan Zhengzong Qinpu</I> (1585; punctuation follows the lyrics)

<P><IMG SRC="images/1585xhjw.jpg" ALIGN=CENTER BORDER=1 WIDTH=800 HEIGHT=114> 

<P>The differences in style are easy to see: <I>Zheyin</I> melodies, being the same as those in the purely instrumental <I>SQMP</I>, have less clearly vocal style; <I>CXZCQP</I> pieces have less left hand ornamentation, something more common with <I>qin</I> melodies that are more clearly songs. Since nothing is written about how to sing either one, the only way to get an answer to such questions is probably to reconstruct large sections of the repertoire, try to sing them, and see to what this leads.

<P>In <I>Zheyin</I> the above pairing of the lyrics and music leaves the impression that either the compiler wrote the lyrics himself but didn't know the music very well, or he had some pre-existing lyrics he was trying to fit to the music but couldn't quite do it. The pairing in <I>CXZCQP</I> of the same lyrics to a related melody music does fit: has its music been changed to fit the lyrics of <I>Zheyin</I>? Or does <I>CXZCQP</I> represent an older sung version, and the compiler of <I>Zheyin</I> was trying to fit those lyrics to the music of the Zhe school?

<P>Another early handbook said to represent a lyrical style is 
<A HREF="../10tgyy.htm"><I>Taigu Yiyin</I></A>. In 1976 Dr. Dale Olsen, then at Chinese University of Hong Kong, performed in Hong Kong his own reconstructions of several pieces from <I>Taigu Yiyin</I>. As of now, I know of no commercial recordings from this first collection. The same is true of both <I>CXZCQP</I> and, except for my recording, <I>Zheyin</I>. 

<P>Since, except as just noted, none of these pieces had been played for centuries (though a few of the <I>Zheyin</I> pieces also found in <I>SQMP</I> have been reconstructed recently from that book), in <I>Zheyin</I> it cannot be said that the relationship between lyrics and music in old qin handbooks has been properly studied. In <I>Zheyin</I> much of the rhythm of the lyrics does seem to fit the rhythm of the music. However, this does not necessarily mean the music was intended to be sung. They could have been used as a mnemonic device, either studied while learning the piece, or sung by the performer to himself when playing.

<P><A NAME="mbs"><B>Music Beyond Sound</B>

<P>Concerning the "Xi Xian" of the introductions, the translation "Beyond-Sounds Immortal" and the title <I>Music Beyond </I>Sound are based on a reference in 
<A HREF="../../09hist/other/laozi.htm">Laozi</A>, Chapter 11, which says of the Tao<A NAME="r24" HREF="#f24"><B><SUP>24</SUP></B></A>:

<DIR>&quot;One looks but is unable to see it, so it is called 'formless'; one listens but is unable to hear it, so it is called 'soundless' (<I>xi</I>); one grasps but is unable to hold it, so it is called 'intangible'. These three, being unresolvable, are mixed together as one.&quot;</DIR>

<P>&quot;Soundless&quot; here implies beyond normal hearing.

<B><I>Zheyin Shizi Qinpu</I> 浙音釋字琴譜</B>
<BR>This handbook is included in Vol. 1 of both the old (Beijing, 1962) and new (Shanghai, 1981; pp.187-252) series of 琴曲集成 <I>Qinqu Jicheng</I>. The first folio had (double) pages 1 to 66, but is missing 1 to 4 and 5 to 21. The last folio has pages 67 to 143, but ends during a piece. In <I>Qinqu Jicheng</I> (New Series) the missing pages are indicated on pages 187, 192 and 252. The second folio (卷 <I>juan</I>) begins on page 214. For speculation about the missing parts see "How complete is the surviving edition of <I>Zheyin</I>?" below.

<B>Oddity in the pairing</B>
<BR>As mentioned, lyrics are paired by the method of one character for each <A HREF="../../05poet/qinci.htm#dianju"><I>dian</I></A>, apparently defined as any right hand and certain left hand strokes. Thus, by counting the number of <I>dian</I> in a melody one can determine the number of characters required. For a number of melodies in the 1585 handbook the number of characters for the lyrics in each section seem to correspond very well with the number of <I>dian</I> in the 1425 tablature. In some cases each phrase seems to match as well, but in other cases although the overall number of characters from 1585 is the same as the number of <i>dian</I> in 1425, there seems to be little or no relationship between the phrasing of the 1585 lyrics and the 1425 melody. I do not have an explanation for this phenomenon.
