At first I was afraid, I was petrified.<br />
When you said you had 10 inches, Lord I almost died!<br />
But I ' d spent so many years just waiting for a man that long, That I grew strong, and I knew that I could take you on...<br />
But there you are, another lie,<br />
I was ready for a Big Mac and you ' ve brought me a French fry!<br />
I should have known that it was bulls***t,  just a sad pathetic dream Should have known there was no Anaconda lurking in those Jeans! <br />
<br />
Go on now-go! , Walk out the door,<br />
Don ' t you promise me 10 inches, then turn up with only 4!<br />
Weren ' t you a brat to think I wouldn ' t find you out!?<br />
Don ' t you know we ' re only joking when we say size don ' t count??!! <br />
<br />
[Chorus] <br />
<br />
I will survive! I will survive!<br />
Cuz as long as I have batteries,<br />
My s * x life ' s gonna thrive!<br />
I will always have good s * x,<br />
With a handful of latex!<br />
I will survive! I will survive! Hey! Hey!<br />
<br />
It took all my self control not to laugh out loud, When I saw your little weiner standing tall and proud!<br />
But to hell with your ego and to hell with all your needs, Now I ' m saving all my lovin ' for a cordless multispeed!<br />
<br />
[Chorus] <br />
<br />
I will survive! I will survive!<br />
Cuz as long as I have batteries,<br />
My s * x life ' s gonna thrive!<br />
I will always have good s * x,<br />
With a handful of latex!<br />
I will survive! I will survive! Hey! Hey!</div></div><hr />
